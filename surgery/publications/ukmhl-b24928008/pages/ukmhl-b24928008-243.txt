ON EXOSTOSIS. lays the foundation of a very tedious, and some- times of a dangerous disease. , ’ ; At the insertion of the deltoid muscle in the < os humeri, 1 have also seen this disease occur. The periosteal exostosis occupies either a very small portion of the bone, or is extended over' : a considerable surface, sometimes nearly its ’ whole circumference, sometimes several inches of its length. The following case, extracted 1 fi'om the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, forms a circumstantial detail of its history, when it is of great magnitude. CASE. Catharine Coulson, aged 30 years, unmar- ried, was admitted into Guy’s Hospital, under the care of Mr. Astley Cooper, Nov. 29, 1809, on account of a firm equable and immoveable tumor situated at the upper and external part of the left arm, so high up, that on a superficial inspection, it seemed to be .connected, not only with the humerus itself, but also with the cla- vicle and scapula, rendering it probable that it had an attachment to the glenoid cavity of the latter bone. The arm, however, could be moved forwards and backwards; but in consequence of the weight of the tumor, and the great at- tenuation, and perhaps complete obliteration of part of the deltoid muscle, produced by its pressure, the voluntary motion upwards was lost. On minute examination it was ascertained, that this enlargement arose from the superior part of the humerus j but as symptoms of inflamma-

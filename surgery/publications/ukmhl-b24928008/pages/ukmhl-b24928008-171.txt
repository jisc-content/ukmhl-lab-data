ON THE AORTA, 131 made into the aneurism by the sloughing pro- cess, was situated too far from the natural seat of the artery, to allow a hope of my finger reaching it from thence. As I was quitting the patient’s bed-side, I felt a great regret, in which all the students by whom I was surrounded joined me, that the patient should be left to perish without giving him the only chance which remained 'of preventing his immediate dissolution from hae- morrhage, by tying the aorta; and I therefore said, “ Gentlemen, this only hope of safety I am determined to give him.” The operation was performed as follows: The patient’s shoulders were slightly elevated by pil- lows, in order to relax, as much as possible, the abdominal muscles; for I expected that a protru- >sion of the intestines would produce embarrass- ment in the operation, and was greatly gratified to find that this was prevented by their empty state, in consequence of the involuntary evacu- iation of the fasces; and here let me remark that II should, in a similar operation, consider it ab- ^solutely necessary, previously to empty the Ibowels by active aperient medicines. I then made an incision three inches long iinto the linea alba, giving it a slight curve to oavoid the umbilicus: one inch and a half was .above, and the remainder below the navel, and tthe inclination of the incision was to the left side of the umbilicus in this form ( l> ). Having di- wided the linea alba, I made a small aperture into the peritoneum, and introduced my finger into the abdomen; and then, with a probe-pointed bistoury, enlarged the opening into the perito- K 2 Artery could not be reached from the slough.

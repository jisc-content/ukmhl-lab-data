ON EXOSTOSIS. 170 Seat. Bones of the cra- nium. cartilage, which forms the nidus for the ossific deposit: and by the fungous^ is to be understood, a tumor of softer structure than cartilage, yet firmer than fungus in other parts of the body, containing spicula of bone, malignant in its nature, depending on a peculiar state of consti- tution and action of vessels; a disease similar to that which Mr. Hey has denominated Jungus hcEmatodes^ but somewhat modified by the struc- ture of the part in which it originates. The venereal exostosis, or node, although de- pending upon a different cause, is still a cartila- ginous exostosis. But this subject I do not now intend to consider, as it ought rather to form part of an essay on the venereal disease. I know no bone in the body which is not liable to the formation of these diseases, al- though there are some in which it much more frequently occurs than in others. Upon the bones of the cranium we see both kinds of exostosis. That which forms between the outer table of the skull and the pericranium is of an extremely hard consistence, is generally attended with little pain, and does not usually acquire any considerable magnitude; but a very large tumor, with a basis of bone, was lately removed by Sir Everard Home from the head of a person in St, Georgeâ€™s Hospital. Four of these have been known to arise from the same osfrontis; one of larger, and three of smaller size. The fungous exostosis springing from the diploe of the skull, is of less firm consistence, and is endowed with a greater degree of vascu- larity than the former. It is of .a malignant kind, 8

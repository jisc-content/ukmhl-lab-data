ON DISLOCATIONS. 9 students might observe this case, of which the following is the account. CASE. Ann Parish was admitted into Guyâ€™s Hospital in the autumn of 1810, for a dislocation of the left patella from relaxation of the ligaments. She had for four years previously a large accu- mulation of synovia in that knee, suffering some pain and much inconvenience in walking. Blis- ters had been applied without much effect, and other means tried about four months before her admission. When the knee had acquired a consi- derable size, the swelling spontaneously subsided, and she then first discovered that the patella be- came dislocated when she extended tlie limb. She suffered some pain whenever-'tMs'TTappened, and she lost the power of the limb in walking so as to fall when the patella slipped from its place, which it did whenever she attempted to walk with- out a bandage. The patella was placed upon the external condyle of the os femoris, when thrown from its natural situation, and did not return to it without considerable pressure of the hand. In other respects her health was good. Straps of adhesive plaster were ordered to be applied, and a roller to be worn, which succeeded in pre- venting the dislocation so long as they were used, but the bone again slipped from its place when they were removed. A knee cap made to lace over the joint was ordered for her. If muscles are kept extended for a length of paralysis.

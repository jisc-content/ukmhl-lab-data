39 ON DISLOCATIONS. neglected accident in shewing the resources of nature in producing restoration. The reduction of this dislocation is generally Reduction, very easily effected. If the accident has hap- pened recently, all that is required is to place the patient upon his back, to separate the thighs as widely as possible, and to place a girt be- tween the pudendum and upper part of the thigh, fixing it to a staple in the wall. The surgeon then puts his hand upon the ancle of the dislocated side, and draws it over the sound ' ^ leg, and it slips into its socket. Thus I saw a dislocation reduced, which had happened very recently, and which was subjected to an extension in St. Thomas’s Hospital almost imme- diately after the patient’s admission. In this case the thigh might be fixed by the bed-post received between the pudendum and the up- per part of the limb, and the leg be carried inwards across the other. But in general it is required to fix the pelvis by a girt passed around it, and crossed under that which passes around the thigh, otherwise the pelvis moves in the same direction with the head of the bone. (See Plate.) And in those cases in which the dislocation has existed for three or four weeks, it is best to place the patient upon his side, to fix the pelvis by one bandage, and to carry another under the thigh to which the pullies are affixed, then to draw the thigh upwards whilst the surgeon presses down the foot, to prevent the lower part of the limb being drawn with the thigh-bone. Thus the limb is used as a lever with very considerable power. Great care must be taken not to ad- vance the leg in any considerable degree, other-

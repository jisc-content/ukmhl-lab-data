And indeed, at length, when she was discharged from the hospital, some slight ulcer- ation of its surface was still remaining: but it was thought adviseable that she should have the advantage of a more salubrious air than that of an hospital in a large town. Dissection.â€”The exostosis was seated at the lower part of the femur; the periosteum passed over it, and adhered strongly to its surface. The tumor itself was very firmly fixed to the external surface of the shell of the bone. It was injected minutely with size. In some parts it appeared extremely red from the injection ; in others, where the injection would not enter, it was white, so that it was found very vascular in some parts, and in others not at all so. The surface of the tumor was lobulated. The peri- osteum at one part appeared to have formed, upon its external sui'face, a tumor composed of j similar materials to that which was seated be- | tween it and the bone.

Within the cancellated structure, there appears in some instances to liave existed a slight inflamma-

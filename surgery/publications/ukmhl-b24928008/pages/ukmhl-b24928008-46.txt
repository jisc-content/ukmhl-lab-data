22 ON DISLOCATIONS. Constitu- tioaal. Nausea. by constitutional. The power of the muscles in the first instance, is to be duly appreciated, which forms the principal cause of resistance. The means to be employed for the purpose are, to produce a tendency to syncope and sometimes fainting itself by the abstraction of a quantity of blood, and by placing the pa- tient in a warm bath to occasion a similar feel- ing. If the blood be removed quickly, by a large orifice, it is known that fainting is more readily produced, and a hot-bath from 100° to 110° will often not produce syncope, unless blood has been previously drawn. But of late years I have practised another mode of lowering the action of the muscles, by exhibiting nauseating doses of tartarized anti- mony. This given in repeated doses, produces sickness but not vomiting ; emetics have been recommended, and there is no doubt but the state of nausea which they produce is useful; but the vomiting is in itself of no use, for as soon as the nauseating effect is produced, the muscles lose their tone, and dislocations can be reduced, with comparatively less effort,- and at a more distant time from the accident, than can be effected in any other way. Two cases are related in the following pages. One from Mr. Norwood, surgeon, Hertford, the other from Mr. Thomas, apothecary to Saint Luke^s Hospital, in which, by the combination of bleed- ing, warm batli, and nauseating doses of tartariz- ed antimony, dislocations were reduced at a pe- riod from the accident, greater than I have ever known in any other example. One of these

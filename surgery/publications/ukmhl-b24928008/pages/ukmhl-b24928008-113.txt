15 ON IRITIS. ?v'hich it depends, being defective or no longer secreted. The inflammation of the eye after syphilis is i; 'lot, so far as I have observed, characterized by liny peculiarities, so much as the shade of colour 1 of the inflamed conjunctiva and sclerotic, and !:he appearance assumed by the deposited lymph. iXhe former have a brickdust or dusky red, in- ; itead of a bright scarlet hue, and the lymph is ! :conipact and brown, and intimately adhering to ! dthe iris, instead of curd-like, loose, and of a yel- ! Jewish white colour. When the conjunctiva is .highly vascular and florid, as in common oph- tthalmia, and the lymph is diflused, white, loose iin texture, and purifoi m in appearance, especi- lally where the cornea is at the same time clouded, aand the eye very irritable to light, I have con- ssidered tue case to be essentially unconnected vwith syphilis. I do not however feel quite con- tfident of the accuracy of this opinion. The i irritability of the eye to the light has been consi- (dered as diagnostic, and it certainly is so, Ibetween the primary iritis and that which ensues lupon or IS accompanied by acute inflammation (of the conjunctiva. In the latter case the cornea iis hazy, and the aqueous humour turbid ; yet the ivision is not more affected than in the inflamed liris, which has proceeded to the deposition of 1 lymph. The treatment of the disease, which is fortu- ! nately one of the best ascertained points in pa- 1 thology, would seem to throw light upon its ori- I gin ; but the habit of reference to the remedy in ' order to ascertain and class the disease, appears I to me a proceeding altogether unscientific and Peculiari- ties after syphilis. Remedy no clue to the disease.

ON EXOSTOSI9, 7 ^urg^oncy of that liospital, she became my pa- tient, and was the first person on whom J per- formed any operation in that institution. In answer to my inquiries respecting the first ap- pearance of this tumor, she stated that it had begun in her childhood, and had now existed forty-four years. It had acquired the magni- tude which I have endeavoured to express in the plate subjoined to this paper, but was of the form of an inverted pyramid, the apex being attached to the tibia, and considerably narrower than the base, which constituted the surface of the exostosis. A small ulcer was seated on its external surface. It was not, nor indeed had it ever at any time been extremely painful, and what little pain she had sutFered was of the obtuse kind. As the ulcer above mentioned rendered her apprehensive of ill consequences, and I had represented to her 4 4hat she could not hope to obtain relief from any other means than that of sawing oflT the tumor, she readily submitted to the operation.

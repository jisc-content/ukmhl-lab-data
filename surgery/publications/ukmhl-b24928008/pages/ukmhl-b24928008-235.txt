195 ON EXOSTOSIS. •I I ) CASE. A girl 19 years of age was admitted into Guy’s Hospital for what was at first supposed to be an enlargement of the knee-joint, but upon more particular examination, it was discovered, that the swelling occupied the lower part of the os femoris, to which it was immoveably attached. The countenance of this girl was sallow, her general health appearing extremely defective. The swelling was small at her first admission, but during the time she was in the hospital, it rapidly increased; the skin was undiscoloured, and the surface of the tumor was tuberculated, bard as bone in some parts, but elastic in others. It was at first entirely unattended with pain; but as it increased it became occasionally ex- tremely painful, and evidently re-acted upon her constitution in such a manner as to threaten her life, unless the operation of amputation should be had recourse to. The limb was con- sequently removed. Violent constitutional irri- tation succeeded to the operation, which for several days excited an apprehension for her life. When these symptoms subsided, the stump put on an unhealthy appearance. Its irrita- bility was excessive, so that she dreaded ex- tremely the approach of her medical attendants for the purpose of changing the local applica- tions. A fungus arose from the cancellated structure of the bone, which it was necessary to Case of this disease in the os fe- moris. Appear- ance and health of the patient. Amputa- tion.

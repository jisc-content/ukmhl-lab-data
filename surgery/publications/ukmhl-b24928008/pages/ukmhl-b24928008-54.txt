so ON DISLOCATIONS. Muscles. Cause. Reduction. In the dislocation upwards, the pyriformis and the glutei muscles are all shortened, as are also the triceps and pectineus, the psoas magnus and iliacns internus, the rectus, the semitendinosus and semimembranosus, and one head of the biceps. The obturator externus is shortened, but the obturator internus, gemini and quad- ratus are put upon the stretch. The muscles which, more than others, resist the reduction, are the glutei and triceps. The cause of this dislocation is, that the pa- tient falls when the knee and foot are turned inwards, or he receives a blow whilst the limb is in that position, and the head of the bone is then dislocated upwards, and turned back- wards. In the reduction of this dislocation the follow- ing plan is to be adopted *. take from the patient from twelve to twenty ounces of blood, or even more, if he be a very strong man; and then place him in a warm-bath at the heat of 100®, and gradually increase it to 110°, until he feels faint. During the ti^nehe is in the warm-bath, give him a grain of tartarized antimony every ten minutes until he feels some nausea, then re- move him from the baths and put him in blan- kets, and place him between two strong posts, about ten feet from each other, in which two' staples are fixed; or rings may be screwed inta the floor, and the patient be placed upon it. Our usual method is to place him on a table covered with a thick blanket, upon his back; then a strong girt is passed between his pu- dendum and thigh, and this is fixed to one of

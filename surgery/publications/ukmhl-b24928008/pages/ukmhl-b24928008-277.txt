About an inch above the puncture its cavity was obliterated ; the obliteration ex- J tended to the shoulder; the branches which y communicated with the cephalic vein at the ( bend of the arm were healthy; the absorbent 1 glands above the clavicle were enlarged and i| hardened ; the internal jugular vein was much enlarged, thickened, and indurated ; the effects i of inflammation were apparent throughout its [ whole course ; it had the external appearances I of an artery, though larger than any artery, I except the aorta ; the subclavian, axillary, and j brachial veins, to the bend of the arm, exhibited II similar appearances.

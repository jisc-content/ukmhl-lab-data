ON EXOSTOSIS. 223 -began to feel pain in the left leg. Not speak- : ing the English language fluently, he neglected applying to any professional person. In 1817, the pain still augmented, and though not violent, was exhausting him by continued irritation. It ' was particularly felt immediately above and be- ( • low the knee, very slightly in the hip, and it some- times extended to the foot. In the month of i .January he applied to me, and I found the disease i ’was a large exostosis on the pubes. On the 13th j lof March he submitted to have the tumor i jremoved, which was in part effected by Ma- ichelPs saw and in part by Hey’s. On the 10th of April the wound was healed, and on the 22d Ihe was able to walk two miles without .suffering ipain or complaining of any inconvenience, ex- icepting that the skin felt tightly bound doWR lupon the bone. It appears then, that bones, after operations, lunite by adhesion to the soft parts; if adhesion ccannot be produced, healthy gramdations ariso (from the surface of the bone, and cicatriza- tion takes place upon these, as upon other parts of the body ; and that there is reason to believe, that these structures may, with pro- perly constructed instruments, become much more the subjects of operations, than they have hitherto been considered.

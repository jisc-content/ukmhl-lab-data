5 ON DISLOCATIONS. the following case. “ A man had his thigh dis- located upwards and backwards on the ilium, which was soon after reduced; the next day, a considerable swelling was observed on the part, which continued to increase, accompanied with rigors, and in four days the patient died. On dissection, the capsular ligaments and liga- mentum teres were found entirely torn away, and a considerable quantity of pus extravasated in the surrounding parts.”—See Minutes of the Physical Society, Guy’s Hospital, Nov. 12, 1791. I attended the master of a ship, who had dislo- cated his thigh upwards; an extension was made to all appearance successfully, but in a few days a large abscess formed on the thigh, which destroyed the man. Generally, how- ever, the inflammation is but slight which fol- lows these accident%^-^:tT6^imb, if unreduced, forms foi* itself a new bed, and some degree of motion is gradually recovered, although from neglected dislocations in the lower extremity, the patient is ever after lame, and in the upper, the motion and power of the limb are very much diminished. On examination of the bodies of those who Dissection die from dislocations which arise from violence, the head of the bone is found completely re- moved from its socket. The ligament is torn to a great extent transversely; the particular ligaments of joints, as the ligamentum teres of the hip is torn through ; but the tendon of the biceps in dislocations of the os humeri remains unbroken as far as I have had an opportunity of judging by dissection, although 1 should be

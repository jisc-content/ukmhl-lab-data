279 LIGATURES OF VEINS. . The indisposition of the venous membrane to 1 ndispo'^i- inflame is not, as appears to me, inconsistent compaui.ic with its obvious tendency under adequate ex- â€˜ *' ^ / 61 ve action. citement to inordinate and excessive inflamma- tion. It is not unusual to find the morbid ac- tions of parts that are difficultly roused least controulable, when once set up. The mixed ter- ruinations of the inflammation of the venous membrane in the adhesive, suppurative and ul- cerative states, and its disposition to spread by continuity, are characteristic of inflammation in the cellular membrane, as seen in the erysi- j pelas and other affections, and are therefore pro- bably to be referred to the predominance of this texture in its composition. It appears difficult to account for the origin Origin, lo- of this inflammation ; if we refer it to the ope- sututionai? ration of any peculiar and purely local cause, how are we to reconcile the infrequency of its occurrence, after an operation so constantly and so carelessly practised as that of blood-letting? jj not to speak of other operations and accidents, 1 by which these parts are wounded, lacerated, i contused, compressed, ulcerated, &c. Besides, i we have seen that it occasionally follows va- j rious and dissimilar modes of local irritation. The apparent inadequacy of the local injury as a cause, the rapid and violent character of I the inflammation, and the high constitutional disorder which is manifested, would on the other hand rather induce us to ascribe it to a peculiar il state of the constitution* ; and that subsequent tl venesections, performed upon these patients, I have been unattended by similar local effects, can- I * See Casep, pages 234, 235.

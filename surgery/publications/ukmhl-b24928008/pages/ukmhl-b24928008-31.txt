ON DISLOCATIONS. 7 face of a bone or upon a thin muscle over it, that muscle becomes absorbed, and the bone under- goes a remarkable change ; if the dislocation be not reduced, both the ball and the bone which receives it are changed in their form. The pressure of the ball, as from pressure in other cases, produces absorption of the perios- teum and of the bone, and a smooth hollow surface is formed ; and the ball becomes altered in its shape, to adapt it to its new surface ; but whilst this absorption proceeds, upon the part on which the head of the bone rests, an Qssific deposit takes place around from the peri- osteum, which is irritated but not absorbed. This bony matter is deposited between the pe- riosteum and the original bone, by which a deep cup is formed to receive the head of the boneâ€™; and perhaps no cases cIal3^T^e^dduced', which more strongly 'Hrark the powers of nature in changing the form of parts to accommodate them to new circumstances, than these ef- fects of dislocatibn. (See the accompanying plates.) But in those instances in which a thick bed of muscles intervenes between the head of the bone and that on which it rests, no change in either the recipient or dislocated bone is. pro- duced, as may be seen in dislocation of the thigh in the ischiatic notch. (See plate.) The new cup which is thus formed, some- times so completely surrounds the neck of the bone, as to prevent its being removed from it 'without fracture (see plate) ; and tlie socket

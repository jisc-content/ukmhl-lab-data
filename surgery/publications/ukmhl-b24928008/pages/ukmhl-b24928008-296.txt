252 ON WOUNDS AND Morbid se- cretions of veins by contiguous 65’mpathy. Inflaimna- tioii by ex- tension or continuitj'. • I axillary in an abscess of the shoulder-joint, both of which had destroyed the bones, ligaments, and much of the surrounding muscular parts, shewed no signs of disease. The femoral vein of a man who died of a gangrene on the tenth || day after amputation above the knee for an I extensive fracture and laceration of the leg ; t of another who died of a mortified bubo, in \ whom the femoral vessels had been denuded for ' weeks preceding his death, presented no trace , of inflammation. It is very probable, however, 1 that the fact should escape observation, which was not particularly directed to it, as Mr. Hun- ter’s was when this paper was written. A new and very interesting fact which gives i much countenance to the opinion, that the ca- vities of veins are subject to inflame by sympathy i with contiguous parts, is demonstrated by pre- parations in the collection of Mr. Langstaff, of Basinghall Street, a gentleman, who to the ac- tive duties of his profession unites an uncommon degree of zeal and industry in the pursuit of morbid anatomy. It appears that the veins in the vicinity of parts destroyed by the phagedena of the malignant fungus, and diseases of this class, are filled by a soft pulpy matter, resem- bling in texture the destructive growth*. That inflammation may extend to these vessels from other inflamed parts, is shewn by a commu- nication to the work above cited by Mr. Wilson, of Windmill Street, who describes a very inte- * I lately foniid the internal jugular vein thus diseased^ in examining, with my friend Mr. G. Young, the body of a man whose stomach and liver were alfected with the medullary tu- mor. The lymphatic glandular system was diseased throughout.

46 ON DISLOCATIONS. equal to those in the dislocation into the fora- men ovale. The original acetabulum is par- tiall}^ filled by bone, and in part occupied by the trochanter major, and both are much altered in their form. The capsular ligament is exten- sively lacerated, and the ligamentum teres broken. The head of the thigh-bone had torn up Poupartâ€™s ligament, so as to be admitted be- tween it and the pubis. The head and neck of the thigh-bone are flattened and much changed in their form. Upon the pubis a new aceta- bulum is formed from the neck of the thigh- bone, for the head of the bone is above the level of the pubis. The new acetabulum ex- tends upon each side of the neck of the bone, so as to lock it upon the pubis. (See Plate.) PouparPs ligament confines it on the forepart; on the inner side of the neck of the bone, passed the artery^ vein and nerve, so that the head of the bone was seated between the crural sheath and the anterior and inferior spinous process of the ilium. This accident might, by an inattentive ob- server, be mistaken for a fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, but the head of the bone felt upon the pubis, will at once decide its na- ture. RsducUon. In the reduction of this dislocation, the pa- tient Is to be placed upon his side on a table ; the girt is carried between the pudendum and inner part of the thigh, and fixed in a staple, a little before the line of the body. The pullies are fixed above the knee, as in the dislocation upwards, and then the extension is

101 ON IRlTL^o ' teen clays, when she fell into so violent and obstinate a mercurial colic, with tenesmus and uterine irritation ; her heart palpitated so much, the arterial action was so feeble, and her ema- ciation so considerable, that I was compelled to withdraw the influence of the only means of saving the eye, hoping, at least, that the tran- quillity of the organ was secured ; for the iritis was nearly subdued, and there was some mani- festation of returning sensibility of the retina; but at the end of a fortnight, when the mercu- rial .action had subsided, the inflammation of the. internal tunics of the eye returned with an extent and duration of suffering which has rarely been exceeded. Now the disorganiza- tion was progressive, the anterior and posterior chambers were filled with lymph, and all sensi- bility of the retina was lost. In one week from the re-commencement of the inflammation, the disorganization of the eye was completed. From the general appearance of the sclerotic coat, and a distinct pointing at one part of it, joined to the excess of coagulable lymph in the ante- rior chamber, it seemed to me, that, contrary to my former experience, the iritis had terminated in suppuration. The sufierings of the patient were so great, that, on a consultation with Mr. Lawrence, an incision was made into the poste- ^^rior chamber by that gentleman. No discharge of pus attended the operation ; and this case confirms the opinion, that iritis terminates in the adhesive stage. In this respect it precisely corresponds with Fig. G.

ON DISLOCATIONS. 36 and over the upper part of his right tliigli. Mr. Holt, surgeon at Tottenham, was sent for nearly a month after the accident had happened; he found him in great pain, attended with fe- ver and much local inflammation and tension. He bled him largely, purged him freely, and applied leeches. The leg was shorter than the other, and the head of the bone was seated upon the dorsum ilii; the knee and foot were turned inwards. As I visited Tottenham frequently at that time, Mr. Holt asked me to see the man with him, and we agreed to the propriety of making a trial to reduce it. Mr. Holt and my- self, assisted by five strong men, exerted our best endeavours to put the bone into its socket. Repeatedly fatigued, we were several times obliged to relax and renew our attempts. At length, exhausted, we were about to abandon any further trial, but agreed to make one last effort, when at fifty-two minutes after the com- mencement of the attempt, the bone slipped into its socket. I also, in a case which I attended with Mr, Dyson in Fore Street, succeeded in reducing the limb without the pullies; but the violence . used was so great, the extension so unequal, (and our fatigue was nearly as severe as that of the patient,) that I am confident no person who had used pullies in dislocation of the hip, would have recourse to any other mode, excepting in the dislocation into the foramen ovale.

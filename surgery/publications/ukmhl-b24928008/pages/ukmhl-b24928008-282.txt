ON WOUNDS AND From divi- sion. Remark- able symp- toms of constitu- tional irri- tation ex- cited by the ligature. with great constitutional disorder; some of the abscesses ulcerated, others advanced with great difficulty to the surface, and the patient died, worn out by excessive irritation. In a second case, that of a man who had drunk hard, two ligatures were made upon the vein, and the vessel was divided between them. In three days the man complained of pain in the course of the vein from the place of its division to the groin; an inflammatory blush appeared upon the leg, extending from the knee to the ancle, and on the succeeding day considerable swel- ling. The pain above the ligature extended to the bottom of the belly, and the thigh became swollen and tender upon pressure; the consti- tution sympathized with the local disease, and without the formation of abscessesj as in the former case, this man died, as it appeared, from extended inflammation of the vein. Mr. Hodgson mentions two cases in which the division of the varicose vein terminated fa- tally*, the first on the morning of the fourth day, the second on the seventh or eighth. The same author relates a case from the practice of Mr. Freer, of Birmingham, in which the ligature of a varicose vein was followed by pain in the chest, hurried and laborious breathing, and a vo- miting of blood four hours after the operation, which symptoms were immediately relieved by the removal of the ligature. The operation was followed by fever and vomiting, and re- tention of urine, when performed on another varicose vein of the same patient six weeks afterwards, although the ligature was removed * Diseases of Arteries and Veins, pp. 555, 558.

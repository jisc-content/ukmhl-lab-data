ON DISLOCATIONS. the staples. (See Plate.) A wetted linen roller is to be tightly applied just above the knee, and upon this a leather strap is buckled, having two straps with rings at right angles with the circu- lar part. The knee is to be slightly bent, but not quite to a right angle, and brought across the other thigh a little above the knee. The pullies are fixed in the other staple, and in the strap above the knee. The patient being thus adjusted, the surgeon slightly draws the string of the pulley, and when he sees that every part of th^.bandage is upon the stretch, and the patient begins to complain, he waits a little to give the muscles time to fatigue ; he then draws again, and when the patient complains much, again rests, until the muscles yield. Thus he gradually proceeds until he finds the head of the bone descend. When it reaches the lip of the acetabulum, he gives the pulley to an assist- ant, and desires him to preserve the same state , of extension, and the surgeon then rotates the knee and foot gently outwards, but not doing it with a violence to excite opposition in the mus- cles, and in this act the bone slips into its place. In general it does not return with a snap into its socket when the pullies are em- ployed, because the muscles are so much re- laxed, that they have not sufficient tone re- maining to permit them to act with violence, and the surgeon only knows of the reduction by loosening the bandages. It often happens that the bandages get loose before the extension is completed, which should be guarded against as much as possible, by having them well secured

125 ON THE AORTA, which penetrates to the muscles of the back, was more dilated than that which runs between the ribs : indeed, those posterior branches were Posterior ■ so remarkably dilated with contortions so closely parti- succeeding each other, that they resembled a necklace of beads ; and their inosculations with the branches of the transversalts cervicis were very remarkable. The low^er phrenic artery was enIarged,forming considerable inosculations with ( the superior phrenic; the epigastric artery was cdilated to the size of the enlarged mammary, 1 iand was joined with it by very numerous and I cconspicuous inosculations V* This case clearly I 'demonstrates, that the greater part of the blood, I usually conveyed by means of the aorta through f:the thorax, is capable of finding a circuitous ittercostal arteries. |i With respect to the aorta in the abdomen, I ‘ .have met with no instance in the human subject ;l| ijf its obliteration or contraction ; but if such lan event were to occur, little difficulty could lurise in the transmission of blood by collateral |::hannels : the mammary and epigastric, the su— |)3erior and inferior mesenteries, and the lumbar I urteries could furnish abundant opportunity for u circuitous course of the blood. Although in the human subject we are thus lieficient in evidence concerning a circuitous ::irculation in the cavity of the abdomen, yet with respect to other animals, it is probably ge- ; »aerally known that I have several times made

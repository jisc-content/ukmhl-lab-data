ON DISLOCATIONS. 18 The liga- ments. Tendons, Peculiar lig^mentSc the head of the radius, but still these causes are slight, in comparison with others which we have to detail. The capsular ligaments are supposed to resist reduction. But those who are of that opinion, must forget their inelastic structure, and cannot have had opportunities of witnessing by dissec- tion the extensive laceration which they sustain in dislocations from violence; the idea of the neck of the bone being girt or confined by the ligament is quite untrue. The capsular liga- ments in truth possess but little strength either to prevent dislocation, or to resist the means of re- duction ; if the tendons with which thev are t/ covered, and the peculiar ligaments of the joints did not exist, dislocation must be of very fre- quent occurrence. The joint of the slioulder, and that of the knee and elbow are strongly protected by ten- dons; the shoulder, by the tendons of the spinati, subscapularis and teres minor muscles; the elbow by the triceps and brachialis ; the knee by the tendinous expansion of the vasti; but still it is an error to suppose that some ligaments do not powerfully resist dislocations; but these are the peculiarâ€”not the capsular ligaments. The wrist and the elbow have their peculiar ligaments, to give strength to the structure of these joints. The shoulder, instead of a pecu- liar ligament, has the tendon of the biceps re- ceived into it to render dislocation forwards more difficult; the hip-joint possesses its ligamentum teres, to prevent a ready dislocation downwards; the knee has its lateral and crucial ligaments;

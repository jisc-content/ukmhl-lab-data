6 ON DISLOCATIONS. Dissection of old dis- locations. sorry to be understood to say, that it is univer- sally the case. The tendons which cover the ligaments are also torn, as the tendon of the subscapularis muscle, in the dislocation in the axilla, and ac- cording to the extent of this laceration, is the facility with which the bone afterwards slips from its socket. Some of the muscles are very much shortened, some put upon the stretch, as the psoas and iliacus internus in dislocations of the hip downwards, a considerable laceration of muscles now and then occurs, of the pectineus and adductor brevis, in the dislocation of the thigh downwards, and lastly, a quantity of blood is extravasated in the cellujar membrane. When a joint has been long dislocated, the head of the bone is found to have become em-, bedded in the muscles j the articular cartilage remains, if it rests upon the muscles â€¢, but if it lies upon a bone, the articular cartilaginous surface becomes absorbed, and even a portion of the head of the bone is thus removed ; the ori- ginal socket becomes filled with a ligamentous secretion ; its size is lessened, and form chang- ed, by a deposit of ossific matter influenced by the pressure of the head of the bone in its new situation. When the head of the dis- located bone rests on a thick bed of muscles, in the cellular membrane, a new ligament is formed around it, which does not adhere to its carti- laginous surface, and which, in dislocations of the hip, contains the broken ligamentuin teres. (See plate of Dislocation in the Ischiatic Notch.) But if the head be placed on the sur-

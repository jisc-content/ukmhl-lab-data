CASE OF LIGATURE IS2 J Finger passed into the abdo- men. Perito- neum divided by the finger nail. Ligature passed around the aorta. Exclusion of the intes- tine from , the liga- ture. Wound united by quilled su- ture, and adhesive plaster. neum to nearly the same extent , as that of the external wâ€™^ound. Neither the omentum nor in- testines protruded; and during the progress of the operation, only one small convolution pro- jected beyond the wound. Having made a sufficient opening to admit my finger into the abdomen, I then passed it between the intestines to the spine, and felt the aorta greatly enlarged, and beating with excessive force. By means of my finger nail, I scratched through the peritoneum on the left side of the aorta, and then gently moving my finger from side to side, gradually passed it be- tween the aorta and spine, and again penetrated the peritoneum on the right side of the aorta. I had now my finger under the artery, and by its side, I conveyed the blunt aneurismal needle armed with a single ligature behind it; and my apprentice, Mr. Key, drew the ligature from the eye of the needle to the external wound; after which the needle was immediately withdrawn. The next circumstance, which required con- siderable care, was the exclusion of the intestine from the ligature, the ends of which were brought together at the wound, and the finger was carried down between them, so as to remove every por- tion of the intestine from between the threads: the ligature was then tied, and its ends were left hanging from the wound. The omentum was drawn behind the opening as far as the ligature would admit, so as to facilitate adhesion; and the edges of the wound were brought together by means of a quilled suture and adhesive plaster. t 7

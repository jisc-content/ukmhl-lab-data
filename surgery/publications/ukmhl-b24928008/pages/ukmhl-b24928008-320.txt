276 ON WOUNDS AND This inflammatory exudation in a few hours projects from within the fissure made by the ligature, and is increased until it forms a close bond of union between the opposed sides of the vesseL The ligature, which is liberated in ten, fifteen, or twenty days, leaves the contracted ends at a small distance apart, adhering to the sheath, and of a conical form ; the tube being at either end completely sealed up by a distinct coagulum of lymph tapering from the mouth ; and a coagulum of blood is usually present within the vessel. Only exter- nal change s similar. Unman bleeding veins. The thickening of the sheath by an external deposition, and the condensation of the severed extremities within the sheath of the vessels, is the only point of resemblance in the processes : and this may be regarded as the effect of the foreign body, and wholly independent of the changes which the vessels undergo. Compression, which is only a broader ligature, would, I have reason to believe, produce no variation of the appear- ances, if applied to a vein. Upon an artery it is well known it has the effect of a ligature, operating only with more slowness. These experiments, it is necessary to state, \vere made upon the jugular vein of the horse. The human bleeding veins are too small to exhi- bit so satisfactorily the process of healing. I have examined several after death, at early and remote periods, and find in those recently wounded a small coagulum in the wound, and more or less ecchymosis in the cellular substance op- posite the wound, which in the oase of throm- bus is a considerable extravasation. The wound

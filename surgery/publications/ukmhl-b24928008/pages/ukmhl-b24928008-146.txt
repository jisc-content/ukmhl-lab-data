ON IRITIS. 108 The subject is obscure, and an earnest desire to promote the investigation of it is perhaps the best apology 1 can offer for submitting it in so unfinished a state to the Profession. The annexed paragraph shews, upon the highest continental authority, that the use of mercury in iritis was till of late but impedectly understood. â€œ If the surgeon has treated the ophthal- mia according to the hitherto mentioned in- dications, and the same does not }ield, or if none of these appear, then is he justified in re- sorting to empirical means. These are means, the efficacy of which, in obstinate inflammations of the eye, experience has proved j but in the use of which the surgeon has often to neglect indications and contra-indications, One of the most important,remedies of this kind is mercury: that potent remedy which has a particular, nearly a specific power in inflammations of vari- ous kinds, but particularly in inflammations of the eye. Never is it usejul as long as there is an indication for blood-letting. Are there impu- rities in the first passage^ or after sufficient blood- letting, is the inflammation still vehement ? it may be given in such a form that it may operate as a purge. Is the eye very sensible, the body of the patient very irritable, or does the mercury excite too much diarrhoea, the mercury may be given with opium. Is the patient weak, the eye pain- less, relaxed, red, moist, or is the pain periodical, it is adviseable to give it with bark. (Warner on

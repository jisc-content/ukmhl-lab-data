ON W0UND9 AND 282 Sides of veins do not coalesce. sive plasters, which fret and inflame it, are either or any of them acfequate causes of the suppura- tive inflammation in the vicinity of the wound ; they are, I imagine, beginners of the mischief, though it may often be prevented from reaching the interior of the vein. I think, however, that the mode in which the wound is stopped and re- paired, renders more intelligible the effect of these disturbances, and the manner in which from its exposed condition the vein is liable to be involved in the inflammation*; in short that if the wound healed like that of an artery, it would not be subjeetto a secondary inflammation. Although it is clear that veins undergo obli- teration, I do not think it is by a union of the sides of the vein, as is the opinion of Mr. Hun- ter, Mr. Hodgson, and others, or as we observe to be the case in arteries under high inflamma-. tion. The tube, of little less than its ordinary size, is obstructed by masses of lymph ; or not at all reduced in its calibre, where obstruction simply has taken place, is filled by layers of co- agula ; but there is no tendency to contraction of the canal, nor any disposition to adhesive union of the sides of the tube, and indeed the excessive secretion in the one case, and the massive coagulum in the other, are equal- ly barriers to such a union. The disposition of the venous membrane to suppurative or at least mixed inflammation, affords a presumptive argument against its readiness to admit of adhe- bleedinor lepeatrfdly from the same orifice is not, in my opinion, a dRcreef^n^igh a ver}' common one.

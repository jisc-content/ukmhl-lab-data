Separation at twejity- jfive days. • extremity is filled to distension by a long and generally firm coagulum of blood, which is a mould of the vessel, and bears the impression of its semilunar valves*. The coagulum ex- tends for several inches; it is not always com- pact, and lamellated, and adhering to the in- terior tunic, being sometimes less consistent, and broken ; but it always fills the cylinder of the vein. There is no blush upon the inner tunic, much less any sign of adhesive in- fiammation, or thickening of the proper coats of the vein, or agglutination of the contiguous folds; these folds being efiaced on the removal of the ligature; but the cellular sheath of the vein is thickened by a deposit of lymph in the vicinity of the ligature. The application of three ligatures half an inch asunder presents no dif- ference*. The division of the vessel between two ligatures, allows of the retraction of the divided ends to the extent of an' incb,' but creates no diversity in the appearances described*. At seven days the effusion of lymph into the cel- lular sheatii around the lig.^ture i? increased so as to encompass it, forming a sort of canal for the ligature distinct from the wound j and at nine days the ulceration of the coats of the vein, has begun, which goes on progressively till its separation is. accomplished This occupies a period of from fifteen'to twenty five days.— In a young and healthy horse, the ligature was not liberated till the •twenty-fifth day. The ideerated.e.nds of the vein formed a cres- centic sweep, apd were separated' to the extent - * Ste Plate 13.

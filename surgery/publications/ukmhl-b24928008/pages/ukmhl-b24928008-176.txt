CASE OF LIGATURE. 136 Clot of above an inch closed the vessel above the ligature. Aneurismal sac. Neck of the femur frac- tured. around the aorta about J of an inch above its bi- furcation, and about an inch or rather more below the part at which the duodenum crossed the ar- tery. Upon carefully cutting open the aorta, a clot of more than an inch in extent was found to have sealed the vessel above the ligature; below the bifurcation, another, an inch in extent, occu- pied the right iliac artery, and the left was seal- ed by a third which extended as far as the aneu- rism ; all w^ere gratified to observe the artery so completely shut in 40 hours. The aneurismal sac, which was of a most enormous size, reached from the common iliac artery to below Poupart’s ligament, and extended to the other side of the thigh. The artery w^as deficient from the upper to the lower part of the sac, which was occupied by an immense quantity of coagulum. The neck of the thigh-bone had been broken within the capsular ligament, and had not been united. Upon consideration of all the circumstances of the case, to what are we to attribute the man’s death ? It did not arise from inflamma- tion, for the viscera of the abdomen were per- fectly free from it. Cause of His death appears to me to have been owing to want of circulation in the aneurismal limb ; for although the life and w'armth of the other limb was preserved, that on which the aneurism w^as seated never gained its natural heat, which must have arisen from the great bulk of the aneurism, and from the disturbed state of the coagulum which it contained, which would prevent the

ON EXOSTOSIS. 176 Os fcmoris. Tihia. second phalanx of one of the fingers; a consi*- derabJe portion of it was still cartilaginous, but at its root it was bony. The first operation being insufficient to prevent a recurrence, a second was rendered necessary. The os femoris, of all the bones of the body, is most frequently the subject of this disease. I have seen it arising from its upper part at the trochanter major, and spreading into enormous masses which projected into the groin, and upon the ilium. We have a preparation of it occupying the whole of the bone from a little below the trochanter, to the condyles, forming a considerable mass, or rather masses of bone : and some specimens where it is princi- pally periosteal; the shell of the original bone not being yet absorbed; and others in which portions of this shell have been removed* We have also examples of small projections be- tween the periosteum and the bone, rising in the direction of the triceps femoris ; one of the best of which was given to me by Mr. Dodds, jun. son of tlie surgeon of Haslar Hospital. (See Plate.) Next to the femuiâ€™i the tibia is most frequent- ly aflPected with exostosis of the periosteal kind. The seat is at the insertion of the sartorius and gracilis muscles ; and now and then at the inser- tion of the ligament of the patella at its tubercle. We have specimens of this disease in our Mu- seum at St. Thomas's, one in particular, in which the bone has formed a large cavity, covered with a strong bony case, similar to that which I have mentioned in the lower jaw; and another 3

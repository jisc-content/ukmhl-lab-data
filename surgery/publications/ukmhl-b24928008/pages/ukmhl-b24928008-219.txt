ON EXOSTOSIS. 179 ' Of the Fungous Exostosis of the Medullary Membrane, t \ ( i The object of this paper was more particularly to describe the simple cartilaginous exostosis, with the operations which might be undertaken for its removal; but in the dissection of exostoses, we found varieties, of which we judged it neces- sary to give some account, in order to prevent the performance of operations which could never be followed by a successful issue. We shall therefore first proceed to say something con- cerning the fungous exostosis of the medullary membrane. This kind of exostosis is attended with the following symptoms. The disease begins in a general enlargement of the limb in the part opposite to the seat of the complaint, and to a considerable extent around it. It generally occurs in young persons, but I have known . it to take place at fifty years of age. Its 1 increase proceeds very gradually; and even when it has acquired considerable magnitude, jalthough it produces some diminution of motion ’in the limb, yet it does not occasion pain, or pre- vent the patient from using it. When any pain ' does arise from this disease, it is of an obtuse ikind, and is extended very much in the cpurse 1 of the bone and nerve, but becomes very acute ’whenever a nerve happens to be stretched by it, las in the exostosis of the thigh-bone which ] presses on the sciatic nerve. The general health is in these cases defective: ^.paleness, debility, irregular state of the bowels. Symptoms of medul- lary exos- tosis. Health of the patient.

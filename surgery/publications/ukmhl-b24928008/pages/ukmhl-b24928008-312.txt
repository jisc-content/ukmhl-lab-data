ON WOUNDS AND 268 Coagiiluin in wound after bleed- ing. Twenty- four hours. Three days. an animal be killed immediately after a wound of the vein, from which no blood has been drawn, the lips of the wound will be found in contact, and if permitted to live for a short time, the cicatrix will form a line. If a vein is opened by a transverse section, it bleeds without the addition of pressure; and if the vein is half divided, the haemorrhage is with much difficulty suppressed; the blood es- caping into the cellular sheath of the vein and of the contiguous muscles in the direction of the current, and forming a distinct coagulum between the orifice and the external wound. The longitudinal or oblique wound, by which | blood has issued in quantity, presents the same 1 appearances ; an oval naked coagulum forms the j plug of the orifice, and a flattened covered clot, which is an extravasation into the cellular sheath, extends to some distance around it. At the end of twenty-four hours the lips of the wound are found separated, forming an oval proportioned to the length of the incision, the edges everted and adhering to those of the clot; the eversion seeming to be the effect of disten- sion from the extravasation into the sheath : there is no blush upon the edges, nor any ap- pearance of organizable or secreted lymph in the vein or the wound. At three days the same appearances are observed, but the in- ternal margin of the wound is somewhat elevated and rounded, and a thin and narrow membranous expansion is perceived to be con- x tinuous with the everted edge of the internal ^

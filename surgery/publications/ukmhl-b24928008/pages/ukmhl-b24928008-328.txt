ON WOUNDS AND 284 Suf'cessful operations do not ill* flame the lining membrane. Two modes of ttrmina' tion. ginous firmness. This I conceive was that irt- terstitial thickening which contracts the tube to obliteration. It could not from its situation be a coagulum of blood. Whether the varicose vein, which becomes consolidated, undergoes the interstitial thickening just described, I can- not take upon myself to say ; probably it is only an extended and compact coagulum ; in either case 1 imagine that the vein is ultimately reduced by interstitial absorption to that liga- ment-like state, in which obliterated vessels have repeatedly been found in dissections. ^At all events, 1 think we are Warranted in concliftfeg, that the cure of varix when accomplished, as it often has been, by the operations of tying or dividing the vein, has not been effected by an inflammation of the lining membrane. It appears, upon referring to the histories of these cases, that they have two modes of pro- gress and termination, viz. first, the formation of pus and sometimes of abscesses in the vein, which by ulceration of its sides communicate with the cellular membrane, and point exter- nally in the course of the vessel: secondly, in continuous and pure adhesive inflammation, without any production of matter. Mr. Hunter’s case*, Mr. Oldknow’s, p. ^0^, and that which I have mentioned as occurring in Guy’s Hospital, p. 237, may be taken as examples of the first, where it forms abscess, : an event simply depending on the interspaces v * Med. and Chir. Trans. Vol. I. p. 24. Mr. Hunter’s in- deed is an examjde of both ; he found in some parts suppu- ration only, in others, ulceration and abscess, p.i^iP* 2^0 <5t

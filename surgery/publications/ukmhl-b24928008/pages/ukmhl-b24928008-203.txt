AND PARAPHYMOSIS. 163 speak as superseding the operation. A dilat- ino- instrument was contrived by Trew, consist- ing of two elastic plates, which were introduced within the prepuce, and regulated by a screw *. Where parts have recovered soundness, patients are naturally unwilling to submit to an operation, for the sake of a remote advantage, or the re- moval of a mere inconvenience. But in this case more cogent reasons may, and ought to be stated. The diseases to which a permanent phymosis . gives birth, are not simply those, which re- sult as a consequence of its recent formation. Mr. Key’s cases of malignant ulceration, com- plicated with congenital phymosis, are sufficient- . ly instructive, and to these I beg leave to refer the readert. The congenital phymosis is not uncommon. It is a source of inconvenience in micturition : and coition. T believe that it more frequently depends upon a short frenum, than any other ! circumstance, and that the frenum of the pre- ; puce may be in these cases divided with similar I ? advantage, as the frenum linguae in the case of I: tongue-tied children. I have rarely seen in- tractable ulcers of the penis without phymosis, I' recent or original, and have observed the advan- f tage which Jews derive in the healing of sores I from the exposure of the glans. ♦ See. Keister’s Surgery, Vol. II. plate 26. fig. 5. I join with Keister in much doubting its usefulness, and that of any ' similar contrivance. The thin integument of the prepuce is lacerated when forcibly extended. t See Practical Observations in Surgery, 2d ed. chap. xiv. On the Cancer of the Penis.” M 2

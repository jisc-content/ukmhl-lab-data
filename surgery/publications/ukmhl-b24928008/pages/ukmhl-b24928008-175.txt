At 8 o’clock, A.M. the aneurismal limb ap- Coldness peared livid and felt cold, more particularly around the aneurism, but the right leg remained felted?fmb. warm. At 11 o’clock his pulse was 120 and weak ; he appeared to be sinking. To the questions which were put to him he did not return any answer; he appeared to have an uneasiness about the heart as he kept his hand upon the left breast. He died at 18 minutes after one, P.M. having Died, survived the operation 40 hours. After being informed of his death, I request- ed Mr. Brooks of Blenheim Street to attend with me at the inspection of the body. Mr. Travers, surgeon of St. Thomas’s Hospital, Mr. Stocker, apothecary of Guy’s, and a large con- course of medical students attended the exami- i nation. When the abdomen was opened, we found not ; )issection. j the least appearance of peritoneal inflammation, excepting at the edges of the wound. The omentum and intestines were free from any un- natural colour; the edges of the wound were j glued together by adhesive inflammation,except- ing at the part at which the ligature prcgected. We were much gratified to find that the ligature no portion had not included any portion either of the omen- J|[ch.Sin turn or intestine: the thread had been passed - * ture.

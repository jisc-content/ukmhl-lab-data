Posterior view of the aorta; a, a, aorta; b, bifurcation of the aorta ; c, c, iliac arte- ries ; d, duodenum; c, ligature onjhe aorta; f, clot formed above the ligature ^ g, clot in the right iliac artery ; h, clot in the left iliac artery ; the clots strongly ad- hering to the inner side of the vessel. This preparation is preserved in the Museum at St. Thomas’s Hospital. I ^ ^ Since the foregoing Essay was printed, I have seen a paper of Mr. * I Lawrence’s in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, wherein an ac- ccoant is given of several cases in which the arteries have been tied vmth silk; and the ligatures cut close to the knot: the result of these k r.'ases is as follows. Mr, Carwardine, of Thaxted, tied the femoral »»rtery in this way for aneurism. The wound entirely united by ad- lesion. Mr. Lawrence tied the femoral artery of a patient sent to I Jiira by Mr. Ilott, of Bromley, on the 29th of March. The ligature » i: :ame away at the end of May, and the wound then Ceased to dis- * I'.’harge. Mr. Kenrick Watson, of Stourport, tied the humeral artery chr a wound of the vessel; in a little more than two months the liga- V »mre was expelled. Mr. Hodgson tied the ulnar artery; a swelling * (I'ormed about the knot which was removed by incision five or six ^ months afterward. Mr. Cumin, of Glasgow, transmitted to Mr. Law- * f ♦fence a knot of a ligature which had been discharged from a stump i lut a considerable distance of time, tw’o or three years from the opera- i Kion.

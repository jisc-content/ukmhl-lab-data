On the fifth day these appearances are more contirmed: the membranous appearance ex- i tends over the surface of the clot, if the wound i 1 is not exceeding a quarter of an inch in length ; • and in larger wounds the coagulum, which is t 1 reduced in size, has a membranous surface. I On the eighth day the new membrane is com- I iplete, the interior margin of the wound is I raised and tumid, and the coagulum of a com- I mon bleeding wound is nearly absorbed. From II the twelfth to the sixteenth day, numerous ^ vasa vasorum may be seen by the aid of a glass, i passing from the internal tunic over the new- d formed membrane and anastomosing upon it. ‘ At the latter period the edges are less raised, so c! as to be more upon a level with the new mem- ; brane, and have a slight red blush. The coagu- i 1 lurn is entirely absorbed. On the twentieth day it is only possible to dis- i; tinguish the recent from former wounds, by the K tenuity, smoothness, and transparency of the new i| membrane compared with the old, which is ll dense, tough, and wrinkled. *1 This description applies to wounds of the size usually made in bleeding; the process is of course longer in completion, though not other- -wise different in those which are more exten- sive. The coagulum, which forms the plug, is exactly proportioned to the size of the wound. The site and extent of the wound are ever after- Five day*. Eight day*. Sixteen days. IVenty days.

261' LIGATURES OF VEINS. the contrary preserve a distinct character, and though closely adhering, do not appear in any degree to intermix. 2. Veins have a slight appearance of fibres passing in the direction of their axes upon the larger trunks. Arteries have a denser and more distinct layer of fibres, passing in the contrary direction. Until of late these fibres have been regarded as muscular ; but recent observations render the accuracy of this opinion doubtful. 3. The inner coat of veins which lines the auricles of the heart, and according to Bichat, the sinuses of the dura mater, although denser than that of arteries, is more flexile. It exhibits the terminations of the vasa vasorum more abundantly after fine injections than the inner membrane of arteries. It does not, however, in the natural state exhibit any appearance of blood-vessels, nor have absorbents or nerves been seen upon its surface. 4. The coats of veins, taken collectively, are remarkable for their tenuity, compared with those of arteries; hence their collapse when empty, which is improperly referred to inelas- ticity. They are also weaker*, but greatly more extensile, especially in the transverse direction ; for they will bear a dilatation many times exceeding that of arteries, although they more frequently rupturet. * This is now the generally received opinion in opposition to the inferences of Wintringham. f Haller, Elcm.

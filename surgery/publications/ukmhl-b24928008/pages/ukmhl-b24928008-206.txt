166 ON PHYJTOSIS Malignant ulcer of the penis, fol- lowing chancre and phy- niosis. plied to them with the best effect, and he was discharged cured. I shall add a case of malignant ulceration of the prepuce and penis, following phymosis, which appeared to have been produced by the persevering use of mercury during the period of inflammation. CASE. OcL 26f 1815.—Daniel Partridge, admitted for an extensive ill-conditioned ulcer round i the corona glandis, which seemed disposed to spread, being surrounded by much inflamma- ; tion of the sound surface. About eight weeks , before he contracted a chancre, for which he :> was rapidly salivated; during his salivation swel- | ling and phymosis took place, and the ulcer ] increased until it had nearly destroyed the pre- ^ puce. :j For some time after his admission the sore appeared to cleanse and improve under the i blackwash poultice,' after which it became lan- guid and covered with a white crust; whicli the application of the argentum nitratum did not 1 prevent from forming. ’ In January following, it is noted that the sore has healed in part, but is no sooner cica- trized on one side, than it breaks out in another, and that a gentle course of mercury which now affected his mouth, had in no sense improved the condition of the sore.

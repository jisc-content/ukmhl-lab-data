The beneficial use of mercury in iritis, is an observation of but few years’ date*. Its use was still more recently confined to the cases which were combined with traces of the syphilitic poi- son. But averse as are European practitioners, from education or prejudice, or both, for they are not always unconnected, to introduce mercury into the system during a state of active inflam- mation, it is now by a multitude of facts incon- testably established as a remedy of unfailing effi- cacy in the most acute form and in every variety of inflammation of the iris. The ascertainment and promulgation of this fact are due to the infir- mary of this metropolis for diseases of the eye, and in the catalogue of modern contributions to medical science, except the practice of vaccina- tion, I know of none entitled to rank before it. It is scarcely necessary to remark, that in the active and early stage of acute inflammation, blood-letting and purgatives should be premised and repeated as circumstances indicate. If the adhesive inflammation is already far advanced before the mercurial action is induced, opacity of the adhering capsule cannot be prevented, nor can such opacity be removed, and hence a motive to its early employment. * Dr. Beer, of Vienna, in a work entitled Principles of the Diseases of the Eye/’ published in 1813, describes as distinct aflections a syphilitic and an arthritic iritis. The former is only cured, he observes, by the cure of the lues, viz. by mer- cury; ihe latter, by the cure of the gout. Jtecont em- ployment of mercury

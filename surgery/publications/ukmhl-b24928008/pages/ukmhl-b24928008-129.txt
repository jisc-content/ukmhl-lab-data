ON IRITIS. 91 SOth March.—Throat well. Health greatly re-established. Appetite daily returning. Sleep undisturbed. Patient gaining flesh. August 1817.—I lately saw this gentleman, who has had no relapse. The right eye and its functions are perfect, and he is in full health. CASE. S. C. ast. 24, a young woman of respectable appearance and connections, was the subject of severe pain, affecting the forepart of the head and left temple; pains in the calves of her legs accompanied with cramp, and generally disor- dered health, which she attributed to a neglected cold. After much unavailing treatment direct- ed to relieve the pains in the head, she was com- pelled to quit service, and in the month of De- cember to come into the hospital. Here she was put upon a course of blue pill, and leeches were applied to the temple twice a week. Her gums were at this time a little tender, and she com- j plained of tasting the pill, but ptyalism was f never induced, although she continued to take the pill three times a day without intermission for three months. On her admission the right eye was slightly inflamed, but it soon recovered. Two montljs alter her admission she took a severe cold by sleeping under an open window, and the consequence was an inflammation of the I riglit eye. This was also superficial, being re- moved by a single application of leeches to the temple. She quitted the hospital greatly re- lieved of her pains, but not cured. In about slx.^'^weeks afterwards, she again Case of iri- tis, fol- lowing the continued use of mer- cury, and afterwards cured by it.

1: 40 ON DISLOCATIONS. wise the head of the thigh-bone will be forced behind the acetabulum into tlie ischiatic notch, from whence it cannot afterwards be reduced. Of the Dislocation backwards^ or in the Ischiatic Jsiotch, Nature of • the acci- dent. Detection difficult. Signs. In this dislocation the head of the thigh-bone is placed on the pyrifbrmis muscle, between the edge of the hone which forms the upper part of the ischiatic notch, and the sacro sciatic liga- ments, behind the acetahulum, and a little above the level of the middle of that cavity. It is tlie dislocation most difficult both to de- tect and to reduce :—to detect, because the length of the limb differs but little, and its po- sition is not so much changed as regards the knee and foot, as in the dislocation upwaixls: to reduce, because the head ot ihe bone is. placed deep behind the acetabulum, and it ( therefore requires to be lifted over its edge, as t- well as to he drawn towards its socket. The signs of this dislocation are, that the limb is about half an inch to one inch shorter than the other, hut generally not more than half an inch ; that the trochanter major is be- hind its usual place, but is still remaining nearly at right angles with the ilium, with a slight in- clination towards the acetabulum. The head of the bone is so buried in the ischiatic notch, that it cannot be distinctly felt ei^cept in thin persons, and then only by rolling the thigh-bone forwards as far as the comparatively fixed state of the limb will allow.

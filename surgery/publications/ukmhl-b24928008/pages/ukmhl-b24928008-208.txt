168 ON PHYMOSIS AND PARAPHYMOSIS. It is my design by these brief observations, to direct the surgeonâ€™s attention to the early stage of the phymosis: to recommend it as an invariable practice to examine the naked glans, ! before venturing upon the constitutional use of ii mercury: to point out the aggravation occasion- * ed by an habitual though partial retention in the state of the extreme swelling, and the ad- vantage which may be derived from the intro- duction of a small elastic gum catheter, espe- cially where ulceration is threatened, in pre- i] venting extravasation and preserving the urethra during healing; lastly, to shew the expediency of the operation in all cases of confirmed phy- mosis, whether congenital or the result of in- flammation. I offer no apology for giving a degree of im- t portance to this purely practical subject, to | which the senior members of the profession | may consider it to be unentitled. The cases, if ; they were rare, must be acknowledged to be sufficiently deplorable; but, unfortunately, they are of common occurrence, while the prevention of them, by a proper view of their nature and treatment, is easy and obvious. I have thought, therefore, that some advantage might be derived from these observations.

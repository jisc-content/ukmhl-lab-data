121 ON THE AORTA. 18 natural. Immediately on turning up the ster- num, the pericardium pi esented itself very much enlarged, obscuring the left lung, and adhering to the pleura costalis. This capsule, which was thin and beautifully transparent, contained about an ounce of fluid, and a heart nearly twice its natural size for a boy of this age. The arteries and trachea were distended above the arch of the aorta ; the contents of the thorax were 'turned downwards ; and the aorta, being divided below the whole, was removed from the body. The walls of the left ventricle were about an inch in thickness, but no other derangement in the structure of the heart or its valves, was observed. TJie capacity of the cavities seemed natural. .The aorta expanded unusually near its origin, so : las to form a kind of pouch, but after having given off the branches to the head and superior extremities, its diameter was preternaturally contracted. It was continued of this diminished isize till after its union with the canalis arteriosus, invhere it was completely impervious. The coats were not thickened, or in any way diseased, ex- cept that about half an inch below the stricture, hhere was a smooth elevation on the inner sur- ace, less raised, but having nearly the diameter )f a split pea ; otherwise the appearance was exactly such as if a ligature had been tied tightly ound the artery. The obstruction was about a ine in breadth. The artery then received three runks about the size of crow quills, and near hem three smaller ones, afterwards resuming* ts natural size along the vertebrae. These three runks are evidently the uppermost of the infe- 7 IncreaÂ«5ed size of tlie heart. Aorta ex- panded near its origin. Preterna- tural con- traction of it. Impervi- ous.

That the humerus itself was diseased, seemed evident, from an obvious , enlargement and irregularity, felt at its inner part, commencing high up in the axilla, and ending about four inches from that point. The j circumference of the tumor, at its most bulging ! part (the admeasurement being taken parallel with the arm) was 2.5| inches ; and a line car- ried round its most prominent part, so as to ' surround both it and the arm, measured 24- inches. This swelling was in general covered merely by common integuments; it was extremely painful when handled, and the skin over it felt much hotter than natural; upon it many large veins were ramified. Motion of the arm gave i considerable pain, which was referred both to ; the tumor and shoulder-joint; and the patient j complained much of the weight she had to sup- port. Her appetite was impaired, and she had some degree of fever. After her admission, the account collected of the commencement and progress of this disease, was the following : about three years and a half previously, after having once struck the summit of the shoulder forcibly against a wall, after- wards fallen on it, and repeatedly received blows on the same part in mangling, she ob- served a firm tumor, about the size of a nutmeg, at the superior part of the arm.

ON WOUNDS AND 286 Whence the fatality of these eases. vein which adjoins, or forms the main trunk of the system. The former cases, although always dangerous, are occasionally recovered ; the lat- ter, I imagine, never. There have been many conjectures respecting the cause of the fatal termination of these cases, at which I confess I feel surprised. Among others, the inflammations by extension, of the heart, or the membranes of the brain, and the conveyance of pus into the circulation have been mentioned. Not to insist on the innocuous quality - of pus, it should be observed that the most rapidly destructive inflammation is that which has the true adhesive progress in which no pus is secreted. But if we consider the importance of the veins in the economy, the ex- tent of surface which the collective areae of the venous tubes afford, larger, I imagine, than any of the shut sacs of the body, and the diffused and disorganizing character of the inflammation, we can surely be at no loss to account for the dis- turbance of the system. It is an error to sup- pose, that any quicker sympathy exists between the constitution and the venous, than the ar- terial or absorbent system. I say this, because I have observed something like that superstitious alarm, which is excited by events that we do not expect and cannot explain, has been pro- duced by the fatal catalogue of tied veins, and a comparison of this with the generally suc- cessful cases of tied arteries. All the mystery of veins is, as I have attempted to shew, that they are indisposed to inflame; but when excited, in- flame by continuity, and therefore it is that the

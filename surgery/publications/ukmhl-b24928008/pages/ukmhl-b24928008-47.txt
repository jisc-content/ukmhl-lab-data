ON DISLOCATIONS. cases occurred at Guy’s and the other at Saint Thomas’s Hospital, at the time these gentle- men were officiating as dressers. (See cases of dislocation on the ilium.) The effect of opium I have never tried, but opinm. it would probably be useful from its power of di- minishing the nervous influence. The reduction of the bone is to be attempted Mechanical after lessening the powers of the muscles, by making an extension of the limb, by fixing one bone, and drawing the other towards its socket. One great cause of failure, in the attempt to re- duce dislocations, arises from insufficient atten- tion to fixing that bone in which the socket is placed. As for example, in attempting to re- duce a dislocation of the shoulder, if the sca- pula be not fixed, or one person pulls at the sca- pula and two at the arm, the scapula is neces- sarily drawn with the os humeri, and the exten- sion is very imperfectly made; the one bone therefore must be as firmly fixed as the other is extended. The force may be applied either by the compound exertion of assistants or by a compound pulley j but the object is to extend the muscles by gradual, regular, and continued force; the pulley in cases of difficulty should always be resorted to ; its force may be directed by the surgeon’s mind; but when assistants are employed, their exertions are sudden, violent, and often ill-directed, and the force is more likely to produce laceration of parts, than to restore the bone to its situation. Their efforts are also frequently uncombined, and their mus-

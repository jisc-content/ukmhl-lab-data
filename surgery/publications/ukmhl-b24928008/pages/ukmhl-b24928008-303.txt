LIGATURES OF VEINS. 259 aritiphlogi'tic treatment, tlie man was in a few weeks enabled, with the support of a roller, to resume his employment. I have seen a case in which this change took i place spontaneously, and was accompanied by like symptoms and consequences. The saphena, ! spermatic, and epigastric veins were affected, greatly distended and tortuous. Some years after the cure of the disease in the thigh, the I spermatic vein underwent a spontaneous con- I solidation. It acquired excessive bulk, weight, I and firmness, still retaining its natural tortuo- i sity, so that it presented a very unique descrip- ! tion of tumor. The epigastric varix remains. This is an inflammation induced by distension i 'of the vessel I conceive, from'arrest of the cir- I iculation. Mr. Hodgson is, I believe, the first i who has publicly noticed this interesting fact. 'The reader will find two well marked cases of ^spontaneous obliteration by the extent of the i (coagulum, accompanied by symptoms of inflam- : imation, in his valuable treatise. “ Sometimes,” he observes, “ the coagulum ' ^accumulates to.such an extent as completely to ; (obliterate the canal of the dilated vessel. I t lhave seen four cases in which this event termi- i mated in the spontaneous cure of varices. In ) iLhese instances it is probable that the coagulum aacciimulated till it completely filled tlie varix, * Kor the upper portion of the vein communicating I ^with it; the blood being unable to pass for- I vwards, coagulated in the vessel to a consider- aable extent; this coagulum was gradnally ab- siorbed j as its absorption advanced, the coats of s 2 Sponta- neous obI‘- te ration.

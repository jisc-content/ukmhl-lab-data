AND PARAPHYMOSIS. t CEuvres Chirurg. de Desault, tom. iii. p. 189. > Both the phymosis and paraphymosis occa- sionalJy arise from circumstances wholly uncon- nected with sexual commerce. “ Young boys,” Says Mr. Latta, “ frequently bring on a paraphy- niosis by retracting the prepuce in diversion, un- til they become unable to pull it forward again. As they conceal this for some time through tear, it is not uncommon for the parts to become in- flamed and swelled to a great degree, and 1 have even found gangrene taking place before the matter was found out*.” I saw lately a case of troublesome paraphymosis with swelled testicle from a blow, and another of paraphymosis from the irritation of a hair lodged behind the corona glan- dis, which had produced a superficial ulceration. Where either state is accompanied by extreme stricture enlargement of the body of the penis or glans, it SoL'* occasions a degree of temporary stricture upon the urethra, so as to induce a partial retention ; great irritation is propagated from the neck of the bladder to the point of the penis, and the urethra in a state of high inflammation, more readily ulcerates, and thus relieves the symptoms of retention. “ It is easy to understand,” saysBichatf,“ how inflammation of the urethra may occasion reten- tion of urine. We have only to bear in mind that inflammation (especially of cellulous parts) is always accompanied with swelling ; and that swelling of the parietes necessarily diminishes ' the calibre of a canal.” * Latta^s Surgery, voi i, p. 391. A case of this description has occurred under notice since the former edition of this volume.

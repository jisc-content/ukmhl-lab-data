3S7 AND PARAPHYMOSIS. JPeh. 25.—This man had taken mercury suffi- cient to heal the sore if it were venereal. He had no secondary symptom of lues. The sore has a carcinomatous more than syphilitic charac- ter. Its edges are thick, inverted in some places and everted in others; its surface is un- even, fungous granulations covering it at irre- gular distances, divided by hollows covered with a dense coat of white opaque lymph; it dis- charges a thin ichor. The root of the prepuce is hardened into a ridge behind the glans. The man complains of constant shooting pains through the body of the penis, and the glands in the groin are slightly swelled and tender. His health, which was lately robust, is much impaired. His countenance is sallow and heavy, and he is much emaciated. Stimulant detersive applications which have been made to the part, have neither given uneasiness nor produced any favourable change in its aspect. Ordered to a clean ward. Soothing appli- cations were now used, and the nitric and sul- phuric acids, the liq. arsenicalis and other tonics exhibited, by which his health was benefited; the conium, hyoscyamus, and remedies of this class were tried, but without benefit; the sore remained as reported. March 25.—Amputation was performed an inch above the diseased part. The stump healed kindly, and he was discharged cured, in May following. This appears to have been a simple sore ren- dered untoward and intractable, and at lensrth threatening malignity from what might be term- ed the cachexia mercurialis.

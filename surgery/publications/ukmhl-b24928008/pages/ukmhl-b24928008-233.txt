193 ON EXOSTOSIS. detailed, (page 191,) I shall here describe. Ah incision was carried from half an inch below the angle of the mouth, to the lower margin of the inferior maxilla, and continued along it to its angle. The flap was then dissected up, and a uniform tumor was exposed, of a hard consist- ence, composed of thickened periosteum upon the outer surface, and of a thin, bony, and elastic shell within it. The surface of this bony nest I with diflicultv removed with a knife; and thus exposed a considerable bed of carti- lage, occupying the place of the cancellated structure of the lower jaw, and expanding the remaining part of the jaw into a bulky swelling. The cartilage was removed from its bony nest by means of an elevator. The inferior maxillary nerve was seen crossing the side and bottom of the cavity^ in its passage to the mental fora- men. ^ It was necessary in the operation to avoid as much as possible inflicting any injury upon this nerve, as every time it was touched it produced considerable pain. In the course of the dissec- tion, some haemorrhage occurred, and several vessels were obliged to be tied. The flap was then brought over the cavity, and united by suture and adhesive plasters. The tumor, on examination, was found to consist of cartila- ginous substance; but of a nature softer than that which is produced from the shell of bone * In describing a bone, I divide it into its shell, or solid surface, and its cancellated structure. o

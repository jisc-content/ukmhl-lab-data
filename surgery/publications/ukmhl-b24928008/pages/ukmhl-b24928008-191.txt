With tumefaction from inflammation of the ist stage, glans or prepuce, easily admitting of a gradual reduction by the assiduous employment of those means which diminish inflammation and the bulk of the enlarged part. 2. That in which inflammation has superven- wastage, ed upon phymosis of longer standing ; where the swelling is excessive, so as to compress and partially stricture the urethra, and unrelieved, tends to abscess, ulceration of the urethra, ex- travasation of urine, and gangrene of the inte- guments. 3. That in which the phymosis is chronic, 3d stage, confirmed, or irreducible ; the glans and prepu- tium being in close adhesion, from cicatrization of their inflamed surfaces. Here abscess or fis- tulous ulcer is formed in the elongated prepuce anterior to the glans; the cellular texture of the prepuce is wholly obliterated and condensed, and resembles the glans itself in size, and often in figure. On slitting it open an ulcerated groove is seen, through which a part of the urine has dribbled.

But the same pro- cess does not immediately take place upon the extremities of the bone, because it is covered by the articular cartilage. This cartilage, before the cavity fills with granulations, becomes ab- sorbed, by an ulcerative process instituted on the end of the bones. Numerous abscesses are generally formed, in different parts of the joint, and at length granulations spring from the ex- tremities of the bone deprived of their carti- lages, and fill up the cavity; generally these granulations become ossified, and anchylosis succeeds; but sometimes they remain of a softer texture, and some degree of motion in the joint is gradually regained. This process of filling up joints, requires great general, as well as local efforts; high con- stitutional irritation is produced, and if the constitution be weak, the patient, to preserve his life, is sometimes obliged to submit to the operation of amputation. Some joints dislocate easily, and frequently ; others very rarely. Tliose which have naturally extensive motions are easily dislocated, and hence the luxation of the os humeri occurs much more frequently than any other, and when it has been once dislocated, it happens again easily in the natural upward motion of the joint. It is wisely ordained that when a part has ex- tensive motion, and great strength is required, it is effected by making numerous joints instead of one. Thus, in the spine in which great strength is necessary to protect the spinal mar- Some joints dislocated easily.

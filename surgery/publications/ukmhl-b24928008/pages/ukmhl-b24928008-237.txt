197 ON EXOSTOSIS. tion, for in the cancelli I have seen small por- tions of ossific matter deposited. I made a section of a tibia, on which a section of large exostosis of this kind was placed ; one half of it I immersed in diluted muriatic acid, and : found that when the phosphate of lime was re- moved, that the swelling remained of its former I'Size, and that a bed of cartilage had supported ithe bony deposit. (See Plate.) The shell of the Ibone, in the remaining portion of the section, (continued entire; spicula of bone in radii, pass- red from the shell of the bone to the periosteum, \whilst in the cancellated structure, opposite to I the seat of the exostosis, a very slight deposit of ibone in smaller nodules had taken place. What ^structures preceded the formation of the car- ttilage, I do not know; but Mr. Howship, in aan ingenious paper which he has published in tthe Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, on the egrowth of bone, has shewn, that a membranous s structure precedes the formation of cartilage i iand the deposit of ossific matter in the ordinary [formation of bone. i| We have in the collection at St. Thomas’s, a Inconsiderable number of specimens of exostoses, fcchiefly seated upon the lower part of the os I Temoris, and the upper portion of the tibia. rThose which have been macerated, exhibit ap- ijpearances similar to that which I have just de- ! sscribed, in which a section had been made; Ibut those which have been preserved moist, in '.which the soft parts have not been destroyed Appear- ’by putrefaction, present the following marks. moist pre- !

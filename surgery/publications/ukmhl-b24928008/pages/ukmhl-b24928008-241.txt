ON EXOSTOSIS. 201 of a shell of osseous matter, similar to that of the original bone of the same cancellated struc- ture, and communicating with the original cancelli of the bone. (See Plate.) Conse- quently when an exostosis has been formed in the manner here described, the shell of the original bone becomes absorbed, and can- celli are deposited in its place. In the mean time the outer surface of the exostosis acquires a shell resembling that of the bone itself. When the exostosis has been steeped in an acid, and by this means deprived of its phosphate of lime, the cartilaginous structure remains of the same form and magnitude as the diseased de- posit ; and as far as I have been able to dis- cover, it is effused precisely in the same manner Are formed , , , , 1 • 1 • 1 same as healthy bone, r rom which it appears, that manner as the formation of these excrescences differs in no respect from that of original bone, since they are composed of cartilage for their basis, and of an earthy salt to impart to them firmness and solidity; a circumstance which I have shewn for many years in my lectures.. For the most part these diseases are attended Notpainfni with very little pain, and, especially at their commencement, are but little complained of: when, however, they have acquired some con- siderable bulk, they do not fail to occasion painful sensations by their pressure upon the surrounding parts; very considerable inconve- inconveni- nience likewise frequently arises to the patients nterrupt- from the impediment and interruption they pre- sent to the action of muscles, the tendons of . j . , , ten- ■which are sometimes detained by means of them dons.

ON WOUNDS AND 27S Dient might be reversed with a nearer ap- proach to truth. Arteries are (juickly and strongly disposed to adhesion, and the hae- morrhages which follow the ligature, after a iapse of time, depend either upon a diseas- ed state of the artery which prevents its in- flammation and the secretion of lymph, or upon the destruction by ulceration or sloughing of an adhesion which had taken place. It is from the latter of these causes that the blood flows at the expiration of thirty or forty days ; for if there be no adhesion, it flows much ear- lier. The contractility of tissue would be a very frail security could it be exerted in the degree supposed; but to expect that this could occur during the residence of the ligature, and to an extent sufficient for security, while the vessel is occupied by a coagulum of blood, in- dicates a very deficient information of the after changes, as well as of the direct effect of the ligature upon the artery. The veins do not adhere after being tied j nor do their wounds under ordinary circumstances cicatrize immediately, nor do the cut ends con- tract and inflame. Further, venous hsemorrhages are peculiarly apt to recur, where the large ves- sels have been wounded ; and this at intervals of many days from the wound*. How the cellular membrane in the venous tissue favours the doc- trine which Bichat inculcates, he does not ex- plain ; but to me it appears that this fact, which he seems to have appreciated, has an obvious bearing upon the case when correctly stated. * Whiteâ€™s Case, p. 243.

260 ON WOUNDS AND Cause? of inflaaima- tion. Causes of oblitera- tion. Differences in texture and proper- ties of arteries and veins. the veins contracted ; the vessel was ultimately obliterated, and the blood was conveyed through collateral channels*.** It has been shewn— That the inflammation of the interior tunic of a vein sometimes follows a puncture^ some- times a division, a ligature encircling the tube, or including only a part of it; or arises spon- taneously from an inflamed surface, of which the vein forms a part. That the obliteration of the canal is some- times produced by the pressure of tumors, or by pressure artificially applied, or by disten- sion from the extent of a coagulum of blood; and that the obliteration is occasionally met with in' the dead subject, where the collateral circulation appears to have been long established, unaccompanied by any circumstances which explain the cause. I shall next inquire the es- sential points of distinction between this and the other order of blood-vessels, so far as re- gards their texture and properties. 1. The external fibrous coat of veins is thin- ner and looser in texture than that of arteries; it is abundantly supplied with blood-vessels, and is so closely interwoven and condensed with the inner coat as to make them in a degree inseparable. Bichat, who particularly notices this fact, remarks, that it is a character distin- guishing the venous from the arterial texture!.

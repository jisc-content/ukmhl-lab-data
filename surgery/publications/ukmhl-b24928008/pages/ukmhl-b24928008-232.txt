192 ON EXOSTOSIS. Cause of disease in thia case. Treatment. Source of irritation to be removed. Removal of the ex- ostosis. Operation. described, it was evidently the irritation of the decayed tooth, the fangs of which projected into the cartilage which was effused within the bony cavity, and which, instead of producing suppuration and ulceration, as it frequently does, kept up a degree of irritation, that did not pass beyond the stage of adhesive inflamma- tion, and a cartilaginous deposit took place in the first instance, to which succeeded an ossific effusion. I have seen a similar diseased state of the tibia, but am unacquainted with the circum- stances of the case. As to the treatment of this disease, it con- sists in first seeking the source of irritation, and removing it as soon as discovered, in order to prevent the further progress of the disease; and indeed it may be probable that the removal of the source of irritation might sometimes, even when the disease has advanced to a considerable extent, succeed in producing a cure, and there- fore it is desirable to wait the event before any further operation is undertaken. Should this however prove insufficient, it will be necessary that the external shell of the bone be removed by means of a saw, and that the cartilage which it contains be dislodged by an elevator. If the integuments be carefully pre- served, little deformity follows; and thus by a simple operation, destruction, otherwise inevita- ble, is prevented. The operation performed, on the 21st of No- vember, in the case of Elizabeth Hall, above

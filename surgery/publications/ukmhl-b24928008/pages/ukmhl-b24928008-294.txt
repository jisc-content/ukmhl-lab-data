ON WOUNDS AND 250 whether spontaneous or in consequence of ac- cident, as in compound fracture, or of surgical operation, as in the removal of an extremity, the coats of the larger veins passing through the inflamed part, become also considerably injiamed, and that their inner surfaces take on the adhe- sive, suppurative, and ulcerative inflammations; for in such inflammations I have found in many places of the veins, adhesion, in others matter, and in others ulceration/*—I have found them,** (these appearances) “ in the bodies of those who have died from amputations, com- pound fractures, and mortifications*.** The origin of this inflammation after bleed- ing, Mr. H. attributes to the wound not heal- ing by the first intention, and the imperfection of union being continued on to the cavity of the vein ; for abscess between the skin and the vein is productive of no mischief, if the vein and parts below have united. The exposure of the cavities of the larger veins in accidents and operations, is often, he thinks, the cause of the very extensive inflammations which some- times attend these cases. He states, that the abscess or the confinement of the matter in the wounded part of the vein, is occasioned by ad- hesions in the vein, a little above and below the orifice ; and in the part where such adhesions do not take place, an abscess is formed, occupying a considerable length of the vein both ways; and often more than one, even a series of abscesses, generally in the direction of the vein between the orifice and the heart, but sometimes between the wound and the extreme parts. * Medical and Cbinirg.

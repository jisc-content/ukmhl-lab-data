25 ON DISLOCATIONS. the extension to the bone which is dislocated. There are exceptions to this however, in the dis- location of the shoulder, which I generally re- duce by placing the heel in the axilla, and by drawing the arm at tbe wrist in a line with the side ot‘ the body, as when the arm is placed close to the side, the pectoral muscle and the latissi- mus dorsi are brought into a state of relaxation; and they form a powerful opposition when the arm is carried far from the side. Great advantage is derived in the reduction of dislocations from attending to the patient’s mind; the muscles opposing the efforts of the surgeon, by acting in obedience to the will, may have that action suspended by directing the mind to other muscles. Several years ago, a surgeon in Blackfriars Road, asked me to see a patient of his with a dislocated shoulder, which had resisted the various attempts he had made at reduction. 1 found the patient in bed with his right arm dislocated; I sat down on the bed by his side, placed my heel in the axilla, and drew the arm at the wrist; the dislocated bone remained unmoved. I said, Rise from your bed. Sir; he made an effort to do so, whilst I continued my extension, and the bone snapped into its socket; for a similar reason, a slight ef- fort, when the muscles are unprepared, will succeed in reduction of dislocation, after violent measures have failed. When a bone has been reduced by the pullies, it will not remain in its situation without the aid of bandages, which are required to sup- port it till muscular action returns. The hip.

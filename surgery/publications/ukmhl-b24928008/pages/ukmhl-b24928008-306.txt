262 ON WOUNDS AND 5. They are less elastic than arteries ; but the. stagnation of the blood in varix, a disease originally depending upon a loss of this pro- perty ; their contraction upon a small quantity of blood, so as to empty themselves by a wound where the circulation is obstructed ; the oppo- site states of their canals under opposite ex- tremes of temperature, and other ])henomena, prove that they possess elasticity in no incon- siderable degree. 6. The trunks of veins are excited to con- tract by the application of concentrated acids and other chemical stimuli. Their contraction, thus excited, is said by Soemmering to be stronger than that of arteries*. They are not excited by mechanical stimuli, and are consi- dered by Haller and others as devoid of the principle of irritability t. 7. Absorbents relatively to veins- are of greater strength ; they resemble the latter in possessing elasticity, and in being furnished with valves. I do not know that this comparative view, which might be much extended, especially if it were attempted to reconcile the discordant re- sults of anatomical research, throws much light upon the inquiry in hand ; but it is to my pur- pose, as it shews some prominent features of distinction in the organization and properties of the different systems. * Loco citato, p. 328. t Sec, Mem. sur les part, scnsibles et irritables, and Elem.

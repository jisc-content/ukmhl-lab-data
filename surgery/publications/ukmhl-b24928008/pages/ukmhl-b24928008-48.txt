24 ON DISLOCATIONS. cles necessarily fatigue, as well as those of the patient whose resistance they are employed to overcome. In dislocation of the hip-joint, pullies should always be employed ; and in those dislocations of the shoulder which have remained long un- reduced, they should also be resorted to. I do not mean to doubt of the possibility of re- ducing dislocation of the hip by the aid of men, but to point out the inferiority of this mode to the pullies. Most writers on surgery have hint- ed at the use of pullies, but they have not duly appreciated them : my good master, Mr. Cline, whose professional judgment no man can deny, always strongly recommended them. During the attempt to reduce luxations, the surgeon should endeavour to obtain a relaxation of the stronger muscles. The limb should therefore be kept in a position between flexion and extension, as far as it can be obtained. Who has not seen in the attempt to reduce a com- pound fracture in the extended position of a limb, the bone, which could not be brought in apposition under the m6st violent efforts, quickly replaced by an intelligent surgeon, who imme- diately directed the limb to be bent, and the muscles to be placed in a comparative state of relaxation ? A difference of opinion prevails, whether it is best to apply the extension on the dislocated bone or on the limb below. M. Boyer, who has long taken the lead in surgery in Paris, prefers the latter mode. As far as I have had an oppor- tunity of observing, it is generally best to apply

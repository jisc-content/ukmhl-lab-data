283 LIGATURES OF VEINS. sive union. That the sides of the vein do not coalesce, is strikingly shewn by the mode of ob- literation which is seen between the seat of in- flammation and the heart, where an excessive furring of the inner membrane has taken place, and probably betwixt the heart and a wound or ligature*. That appearance stops abruptly, the membrane resumes its healthy character, and the tube is gradually contracted to obliteration by an interstitial deposition in the coats of the vein, by which it is rendered a round solid cord of a cartilaginous hardness, in its transverse section narrower considerably than that of the healthy vein. Although imperforate from com- pression, the canal is readily discovered by a section. Dr. Simpson, of St. Andrew’st, had occasion to tie the internal jugular vein in removing a tumor deep seated in the neck, with a part of which it was confounded. After eight days, see- ing no appearance of separation, he cut the vein through immediately below the ligature, and found vein and all quite solid and of a cartila- * The veins seem to fall within the compass of the follow- ing observation:—“ Some surfaces of the body do not so readily unite by the coagulating lymph as others, and there- fore, on such surfaces there is commonly a much larger quan- tity of this matter thrown out than probably would have been if union had readily taken place. Thus we see in inflamma- tion of the heart, that the coagulating lymph is thrown out on the exterior surface in vast quantities, while at the same time the heart shall not adhere to the pericardium.” Hunter on the Blood and-^nflafgsnatmm, p. 305. j-' Edin.*^Ied.

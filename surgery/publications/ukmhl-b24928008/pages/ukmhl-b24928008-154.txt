114 CASE OF LIGATURE First opera- tion for carotid aneurism nnfortu- nate, second suc- cessful. Three sources of medical e^ddence. General considera-j tions on ligatures of arteries; in the larger ca^ vities; rect usj the case we should consider as our own, and we should ask ourselves, whether, placed under similar circumstances, we should choose to submit to the pain and danger we are about to inflict. Guided by this principle, and having collected all the evidence which applies to the case, we perform our duty without the reproaches of conscience which must await those who unnecessarily subject their patients to pain and danger. Those who feel disposed to condemn the at- tempt which I have here described, will have the kindness to recollect, that although my first operation for carotid aneurism proved equally unfortunate with this, yet in the second opera- tion, I was gratified by the successful issue of the case. In collecting evidence upon any medical sub- ject, there are but three sources from which we can hope to obtain it: viz, from observation on the living subject; from examination of the dead; and from experiments upon living ani- mals. By the first, we learn the history of dis- ease;' by the second, its real nature, so far as it can be certainly known; and by experiments upon living animals, we ascertain the processes resorted to by nature for restoring parts which have sustained injuries, and then apply that knowledge to accidents in man. In applying ligatures upon the arteries gene- rally, the chief circumstance to be considered is, the probability of the blood being conveyed by means of anastomosis to the parts beyond ; but in operations upon those arteries, which are seated in the larger cavities of the body, it be-

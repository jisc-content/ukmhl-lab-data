ON WOUNDS AND 228 Inflamma- tion after tying and dividing the saphena, a modern ob- servation. also demonstrated ; but the symptoms charac- terising an inflammation of the nerve, are very rare, as a consequence of venesection, and our observation of the edects of wounds of nerves, does not lead us to attribute any consequences to this accident, at all resembling those which have been in many instances shewn to arise from wounds of veins. Similar serious consequences to those which have been observed after bleeding, have upon several late occasions, followed the operations of tying and dividing the vena saphena majoiv in cases of varix, and have created a general distrust of the safety of the practice ; yet the ancients treated the veins with singular rude- ness—pricking, cutting, tying, and burning them, without ever adverting to any other than the mechanical effects of such operations upon the diseases for which they were instituted*. And that this alarming and often fatal inflam- mation of the inner coat of veins, should so long have escaped the notice of the profession, ap- pears most extraordinary, if we consider how much it was formerly the practice of surgeons to tie the veins after amputation. Many of the older operating surgeons in the country, army, and navy, still adopt the practice, and are un- willing to believe that it can ever be productive * Hippocrates punctured varices. iEtius, Paulus, Avi- cenna and Albucasis describe the operation of excision. This seems to have been the practice of Fallopius and Severinus. Fabricius Aquapendens and Fabricius Hiklanus inclosed the varicose vein between two ligatures, and emptied it by inci- sion. Ambrose Pare, Petit, Dionis and others emptied it by punctures and brought its sides into contact by compression. 8 V •

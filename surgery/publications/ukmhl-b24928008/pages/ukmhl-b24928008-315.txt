LIGATURES OF VEINS. the edges and the relation of the wounds of the vessels and their cellular coverings. “ The lon- gitudinal produces the slightest possible separa- tion. The oblique occasions a separation pro- portioned to its extent: and the transverse, how- ever small, seems to produce a circular aper- ture in the parietes of the artery.^' By disten- sion of the sheath of an artery with the blood which escapes from it on receiving a wound, the relative position of the wounds in the sheath and the vessel is altered, so that “ a layer of blood is confined by the sheath over the wound in the artery, and by coagulating there, prevents’any further effusion of blood.” But “ its perma- nent suppression is effected by a process of repa- ration or of obliteration which takes place in the wounded artery.” An artery, “ if wounded only to a moderate extent, is capable of reunit- ing and of healing so completely, that after a certain time the cicatrization cannot be dis- covered either on its internal or external sur- face ; and even oblique and transverse wounds, when they do not open the artery to a greater extent than one fourth of its circum- ference, are also filled up and healed by an ef- fusion of coagulating lymph from their inflamed lips ,*[so as to occasion but little or no obstruc- tion to the canal of the artery.” “ When the wound is very large, such a quantity of coagu- lating lymph is poured out, that the canal of the vessel at the wounded part is more or lessjilled up hy iC* A marked difference then may be observed in

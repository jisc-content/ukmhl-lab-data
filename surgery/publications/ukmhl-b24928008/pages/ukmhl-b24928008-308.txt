Off WOUNDS AND 264 4. The inner membranes of arteries and veins are susceptible of the adhesive inflammation* That of the former is defined, whether excited by pressure or by wound, or occurring sponta- neously. I never, saw the internal coat of an artery furred with lymph ; and even where lymph is deposited in quantity sufficient to ob-Â» struct the current of blood, the deposit occupies a narrowly defined space, and the inflammation, by whatever cause excited, or however acute, is similarly circumscribed. In veins, on the con- trary, the inflammation extends from the point of irritation towards the heart, or from branch to trunk. The lymph coats the vein like a fringe; and though the quantity effused is sometimes sufficient to obstruct the tube, the inflammation is often not bounded by the ob- struction. 5. The inner coat of veins is susceptible of the suppurative inflammation, and the inflam- mation IS often mixed, presenting both termi- nations alternately, viz, in lymph and pus. That of arteries is I believe incapable of suppu- ration, unless in a state of ulceration. ,6. Veins are more disposed to ulcerative iur flamraation than arteries. I know not whether the interior tunics of either are capable .of granulating, nor am I able to say whether there exists a difference in their power of resistance to gangrene. . , 7. The contrasted eharacter of the inflamma- tion of arteries and veins above-mentioned, ex- plains the active eonstitutjonal sympathy pecu-

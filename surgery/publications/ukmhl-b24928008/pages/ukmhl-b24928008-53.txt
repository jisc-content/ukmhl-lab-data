29 ON DISLOCATIONS. limb. The fractured neck of the thigh-bone within the capsular ligament, rarely occurs but in advanced age, and it is the effect of the most trifling accidents, owing to the absorption which this part of the bone undergoes at ad- vanced periods of life. Fractures externally to the capsular ligament occur at any age, but generally in the middle periods of life ; and these are easily distinguished by the crepitus which attends them if the limb be rotated, and the trochanter compressed with the hand. Tlie position is the same as in fractures within the ligament. The proportion of fractures of the neck of the thigh-bone, which I have seen, is at least four cases to one of dislocation. (See the plate for the positions of the limb in dislocations.) Diseases of the hip-joint can scarcely be con- founded with dislocations from violence, but by those who are not anatomists, and are incapable of observation. The gradual growth of the symptoms, the pain in the knee, the apparent elongation at first, and real shortening after- wards, the capacity for motion, yet the pain given under extremes of rotation, as well as of flexion and extension, are marks of difference which would strike the most careless observer. In diseases of this kind, when they have existed a great length of time, ulceration of the liga- ments, acetabulum, and head of the bone, allow of such a change of situation of parts, as to give to the limb the position of dislocation j but the history of the case at once informs the medical attendant of the nature of the disease.

107 ON IRITIS. resembling the former, in the left eye, and not- withstanding a slight paralytic affection of the right side, I persisted in the plan before pur- sued, diminishing the quantity of mercury one half, and at the same time exhibiting a light tonic; the inflammation yielded as speedily as before. Whether sloughing sores are cured or aggra- vated by mercury, is an inquiry to which it is not difficult to reply, but which does not appear to me to be fairly connected with the question at issue. It will not be denied that ulcers often granulate even luxuriantly under the mercurial action. I have seen a rapidly destructive ulcet on the penis arrested by mercury, to which bark gave no check, but opium is a remedy on which I place more reliance in progressive sloughing. The cutaneous erythema in some well marked cases which have fallen under my observation, has been produced by a very small quantity of mercury, and with such a state I have never seen the iritis combined, which on the contrary usually follows a larger or longer use of that mi- neral. It is a rare case, and is produced by opium, arsenic, and other substances as well as mercury. I am quite aware, that the facts which I have stated in this paper admit of different conclu- sions. Some may incline to consider the iritis after mercury as casual, and not essentially de- pending upon its use. Others may be unwilling to yield their belief of the presence of syphilis in the system, for which they will conclude that the remedy had been ineffectually administered.

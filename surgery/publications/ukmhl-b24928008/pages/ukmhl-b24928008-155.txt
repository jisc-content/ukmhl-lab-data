115 ON THE AORTA* comes a subject of consideration, by what mode the ligature shall be prevented from occasioning destruction. In common parts, it produces sup- puration and ulceration, which end in the sepa- ration of the ligature ; but amidst the vital or- amidst vital J organs. gans, a suppurative process may endanger lire. The Aorta is so rarely obstructed, that the Aorta rare- y ^ ^ ly obstruct- opportunity of ascertaining the power of anas- ed. tomosing vessels in propelling the blood is ex- tremely unfrequent. The first impression arising from examination of the structure of the aorta at its curvature would be, that an anastomosis would not be sufficiently free to permit the blood ^ tion at the to find its course by circuitous channels; and curvature, the only opportunity that I have had of seeing a contracted aorta in the human subject would serve to confii m that opinion : but Mr. Graham has met with a case (which will hereafter be de- tailed) which shews that even in that part of the aorta, the communication may be sufficient to allow a passage to the blood. With respect to the case of contracted aorta, which I had the opportunity of seeing, the fol- lowing are the particulars, as given to me by Mr. Winstone, Surgeon, of Charter-house Square, who solicited me to inspect the dead body :— “ The gentleman, who formed the subject of Mr. win- it, was 57 years of age, of a full habit, accustom- ed to free living, had been in good health for years, excepting in the winter, when he was always troubled with a violent cough; more violent than I ever witnessed in any other per- son.

LIGATURES OF VEINS. 277 has a distinctly oval figure, and while recent, the eversion of its edges is conspicuous ; the cicatrix retains this figure, though in a less degree ; it is more transparent than the rest of the cylinder, and may be detected, however < ancient, by holding the open vein to the light. I have never seen the membrane of the cicatrix assume that pouch-like appearance which has been described in the veins of the horse. There is no unusual adhesion of the cellular substance and the vein, and consequently no stricter con- nection exists between the cicatrices of the in- tegument and the vein than elsewhere. I have had no opportunity of examining the appear- ances produced upon a human vein, where it has been divided by the operation of the ligature. From these accounts it appears, that the in- inferences i r ^ opposed to ternal coat of a vein, instead ofbeine; so strong:- thoseof r . . ^ ^ Bichat. ly disposed to adhesive inflammation, as Bichat supposed, is, on the contrary, when compared with that of an artery, difficultly susceptible of such inflammation. Indeed, the processes of healing and of division by ulceration, seem to be conducted without any manifest sign of in- flammatory action on the interior tunic. I confess, that although these results were unlike those which I had anticipated, the pa- rallel which I have quoted from Bichat of the healing powers of arteries and veins, is so much at variance with our better information of the arterial pathology (thanks to our late industrious experimenter, Jones); and as regards the veins, is so palpably conjectural, that I did not feel much confidence in his exposition.

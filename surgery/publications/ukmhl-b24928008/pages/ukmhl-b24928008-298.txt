Inflammation of the vein after bleeding is much more frequent in horses than in the human subject; but Mr. Hunter was not cor- rect in stating that an abscess is always formed at the wound. The most curious circumstance respecting this disease in horses Mr. Hunter has overlooked. In the human subject I be- lieve the inflammation very generally, if not always, extends along the vein, following the course of the circulation. In horses I have never seen a case where the inflammation ex- tended to the chest, or many, even one inch below the orifice; neither do I recollect any fatal case from this disease. The inflammation extends contrary to the course of circulation towards the head. The cavity of the vein is often filled with lymph ; and when this takes place an abscess forms, and the vein above is lost. I have no doubt that inflammation of the wound sometimes takes place in consequence of the mode used to stop the bleeding ; but I should observe that the most simple wound through the common integuments of horses is scarcely ever healed by the first intention ; and it is this disposition to suppurate and to resist adhesive union, that is probably the most frequent cause of the external wound after bleeding not uniting by the first intention in horses, the same as in the human subject. In a conversation with Mr. Sewell, Assistant Professor of the Veterinary College, he stated to me his opinion that the abscesses described by Hunter must be farcy abscesses, a disease

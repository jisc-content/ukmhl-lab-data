That it was not formerly so regarded, nor even by wri- ters comparatively modern, it would be easy, if it were necessary, to shew. It is true that the mischievous consequences which I shall presently detail, rarely occur in private practice, a plain proof that they are the result of neglect or gross ill-treatment, and that such complaints in a re- cent state are easily remediable. But in hospital and pauper practice we continually meet with people under the constitutional influence of mer- cury, who are the subjects of inflammation of the penis, bordering on gangrene; often by their own indiscreet conduct; and sometimes, it must be confessed,by following the advice of persons who have the credit of being better informed. The most frequent origin of phymosis with gonorrhoea, is the swelling of the glans penis under inflammatory congestion, such as always accompanies more or less a gonorrhoea viru- lenta, and often a sore upon the glans. The in- flammation of the urethra where the gonorrhoea has its seat, or the irritation of a sore, however inconsiderable, causes a detention of blood in the corpus spongiosum penis; and unless an- tiphlogistic measures are strictly pursued, the prepuce frequently retracted, and the surfaces of the glans and prepuce exposed and bathed, the latter becomes confined by the progressive turgescence of the corona glandis within it, and cannot be drawn back without very considerable pain and difficulty.

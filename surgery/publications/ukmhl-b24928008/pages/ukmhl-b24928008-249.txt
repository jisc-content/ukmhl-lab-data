209 ON EXOSTOSIS. I have lately examined the preparation made from this case with considerable care, and on making a section of the os humeri, found it spread into a large and very solid bony mass at tleast three times its natural size. Its cancellated structure nearly obliterated by cartilaginous and Lossific deposit. The bone towards the axilla is less extended than that part which is co- vered by the deltoid muscle. On the outer sside of the enlarged humerus, there is an im- Miense mass of cartilage, in which numerous oossific depositions have taken place. The pe- rriosteum covers the swelling, and adheres firmly to its external surface : the swelling is composed of one third bone and two thirds cartilage, with ony masses intermixed. There is also in the collection at St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital a very fine reparation of this disease^ made by Mr. South, from a patient whose leg was amputated by i?Mr. Chandler. With respect to the cause of the periosteal ^exostosis, which has but a small base, and which follows the course of the tendons or ligaihents, aas that in the direction of the triceps fern oris und gracilis, I am of opinion that it arises from s|p3xertions disproportionate to the strength of the subject. The tendons which are fixed in jfitthe bone becoming sprained by over exertion, iinflammation is excited in them, which is thence ccommunicated to the periosteum and bone, and aa deposition is consequently produced in the; Erection of the tendons sprained and inflarhed, lupon which the weight of the body is more is Causes.

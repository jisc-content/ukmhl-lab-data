181 ON EXOSTOSIS, as to induce a hope of its ultimate complete de- struction by gangrene ; a hope, however, which, in this complaint in the bone, I have never seen Realized. From the surface of the fungus, there generally occurs a very considerable discharge of serum, mixed occasionally with red particles, which moisten a great many folds of linen in a few hours. Thus the occasional losses of blood, the im- mense discharge, but still more, the constitu- tional irritation, wear Out at length the powers of the body j but the time occupied in destruc- tion by these means, is sometimes two years, and at others is a much more protracted period, as from seven to ten years. It often happens in this disease, that tumors of a similar kind form in other parts of the body during its progress; so also when the affected limb has been amputated, a similar disease will occur at a future period, and in organs of the greatest importance to life. This disease originates from tile medullary membrane of the bone within the cancelli, and if a circular incision be made of the limb, and the parts be observed, the following appearances pre- sent themselves. The skin is found in its natural state, excepting that it is projected by tubercles, which proceed from small masses on the surface of the tumor. In one case, in which ulceration had taken place, it was found that the ulcer ex- tended all the way through the tumor to the bone. The muscles are removed to the distance of three inches or more from the surface of the bone, and form a thin layer over the tumor. Discharge of scium. Duration of the disease.

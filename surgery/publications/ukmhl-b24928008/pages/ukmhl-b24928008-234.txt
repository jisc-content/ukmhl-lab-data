Some haemorrhage took place after she was removed to bed, and she complained of i great pain during the whole of the afternoon, in ' consequence of which an opiate was administer- ed. She suffered some pain, and was extremely irritable during the three days after the opera- tion; but as she could bear the extraction of the tooth, it was removed, and, on the 25th of November, the flap had in a great degree ad- hered, and she appeared to be suffering but little from the operation, although some discharge still continued. % I â€™ Of periosteal Exostosis, This disease, like the preceding, is both of a fungous and cartilaginous kind. The former of these scarcely differs in its symptoms from the fungous exostosis of the medullaiy membrane, except that the general swelling of the limb is i less, and the particular tumor is more promi- nent; but there is the same want of sensibility in the commencement, with some pain after- i wards; the skin remains free from discoloura- tion, and has a similar tiiberculated appear- ance. Ulceration, bleeding, and sloughing, ; with great discharge ensue, and occasion the ; destruction of life, if some operation be not performed. ; The following case will illustrate the history of this disease.

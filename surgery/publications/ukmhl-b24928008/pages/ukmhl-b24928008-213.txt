ON EXOSTOSIS. 173 ossific matter, rising into considerable masses. Perhaps however I ought not here to mention these appearances ; as they are not true ex- ostoses ; but ossifications of the natural struc- tures, bearing some analogy in principle to those which are produced in the larger blood-vessels of old people. I have however seen an exostosis arise from the sixth or seventh cervical vertebra, or per- haps from botli. The subject of it was a wo- man who was admitted into Guyâ€™s Hospital, having no pulse at the wrist or elbow. Her hand w^as of a venous redness, always cold, generally benumbed, yet seemed painful; there were small gangrenous spots upon it. On examination of the superior part of the arm, these appearances were found to be the con- sequence of a projection of the lower cer- vical vertebra towards the clavicle, and conse- quent pressure upon the subclavian artery. Whilst she was in the Hospital, by means of w^armth and friction, the natural heat of the arm and hand was greatly restored, the further in- crease of the swelling seemed suspended, and, at the time she was discharged, the arm was in a very improved state ; nevertheless the pulse at the wrist had not returned. The ossa innominata are also sometimes af- fected with this disease, which is more fre- quently seated at the posterior sacro-iliac sym- physis than on any other part of these bones. Boyer mentions an instance of one growing from the os pubis, which produced a retention of urine, prevented the introduction of the ca- Ossa innO" niioata.

14 ON DISLOCATIONS. Partial. row, numerous joints are formed, and tlie mo- tion between any two bones is so small, that dislocations, except between the 1st and 2d ver- tebrae, hardly ever occur, although the bones are often displaced by fracture. The carpus and the tarsus are constituted in the same manner, they allow of considerable motion, yet maintain great strength of union. For if the motion between two bones as in the spine, be multiplied by 24, and then at the car- pus by 7, it will be seen tliat great latitude of motion is given, and the strength of the part preserved, whilst, if the spine had been formed of a single joint, dislocations might have easily happened, and death from this cause must have been a very frequent occurrence. Bones are not always thrown entirely from the articulatory surface, on which they rested, so that dislocations may be partial only. This circumstance sometimes occurs at the ancle- joint. An ancle was dissected at Guy’s, and given to the Collection of Saint Thomas’s, which was partially dislocated j the end of the tibia rested still in part upon the astragalus, but a larger portion of its surface was seated on the os naviculare, and the tibia altered by this change of place had formed two new articula- tory surfaces, with their faces turned in oppo- site directions towards the two bones. The dislocation had not been reduced. Tlie knee is I believe rarely dislocated in any other way. The os humeri sometimes rests upon the edge of the glenoid cavity, and readily returns into

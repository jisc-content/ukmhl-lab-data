ON V/OUNDS AND ^38 Artificial pressure. muiiication with the cyst of the tumor appeared above the coagulum, so that the blood return- ing from the head passed in part into the cyst; there was also an ulcerated aperture of commu- nication between the cyst and the oesophagus, and thus the contents of the tumor were from time to time passing into the alimentary canal. The artery and par vagum were sound, but the former was curiously defended by a covering of lymph. From this, case it would appear that an artery not only remains pervious'under a degree of compression which causes the obliteration of a vein, but that the coats of the latter are de- stroyed by an irritation, which has only the ef- fect of additionally supporting and strengthen- ing those of an artery. Veins in a state of varicose enlargement, have sometimes been obliterated by inflamma- tion, the result of pressure artificially applied. I some years ago succeeded in obliterating a varicose cyst of the saphena, behind the inner condyle of the knee, in a labourer in the India Companyâ€™s service, by means of adhesive plaster, applied in strips around the limlJ, with as much strictness as could be borne. The vein took on inflammation, and the cyst became a per- fectly solid tumor, which afterwards shrunk, and was permanently obliterated. The inflam- mation was severely painful, accompanied by extreme tension of the part, and with con- siderable fever. By continued rest in the semi-flexed position of the limb, leeches and fomentations frequently applied, and an active 8

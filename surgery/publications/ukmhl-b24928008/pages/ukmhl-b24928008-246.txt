ON EXOSTOSIS. ‘206 nished the pain and tenderness : the blood was sizy. As the patient’s arm had now become use- less, and her sufferings, both from the weight, and the symptoms under which she laboured, were very great, she was prevailed on, without much difficulty, to undergo an operation, which was speedily concluded on, and performed on the 8th of December. The state of the deltoid muscle before mentioned, prevented the pos- sibility of executing it in the manner usually directed, for no flap, except of the common integuments, could have been preserved. It was concluded, therefore, that the most ad- viseable plan would be to aim at covering the wound with those portions of integument and muscles, which anteriorly and posteriorly con- nected the arm to the trunk of the body. The first step of the operation, was to secure the artery. An incision therefore was made in its direction, high up in the axilla, two liga- tures put on it, and secured ; when a division was made between them. The application of a ■ ligature on the part of the artery most distant from the heart, was to prevent the possibility of any haemorrhage from such anastomosing vessels as empty themselves into it. An in- cision was next commenced, immediately an- terior to the acromion process of the scapula brought forwards, and ended in the axilla, passing just below the end of the artery on • which the ligature had been applied j and another was carried.from the same point pos- teriorly, and made to meet the former one.

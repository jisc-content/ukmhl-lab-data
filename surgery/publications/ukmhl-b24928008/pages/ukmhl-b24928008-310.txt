The surgeon ought to be very much on his guard after tying any of the larger trunks, on account of this great indisposition of the arterial tissue to hiflame. Even when the ar- tery is obliterated, it is frequently not by inflam- mation. Whilst the ligature arrests the blood, that portion of the artery that is comprehended between it and the collateral branches, clones gradually^ hy means of the contractility of its tissue, and forms a kind of ligament which ob- structs the blood, after the thread comes away. I am not sure that these cases are not more nu- merous than those of indammation. Now the veins always adhere very soon after being tied, and their wounds cicatrise immediately. It is al- most always useless to tie them in large wounds, in the first instance, on account of the valves; and afterwards, because the cut ends contract, quickly infiame, and adhere. A venous haemor- rhage takes place immediately, and not after so long an interval a« in arteries. All this then proves that the vital energy is much more marked in the venous than in the arterial system, as re- gards their tonic powers. The want of cellular tissue in the latter, and its presence in the for- mer, may have some influence upon this phe- nomenon*.” The most deservedly esteemed of modern • Anat. gener. tom.

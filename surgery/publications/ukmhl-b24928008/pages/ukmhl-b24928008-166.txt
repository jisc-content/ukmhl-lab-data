CASE OF LIGATURE 126 Operation of tying the aorta in dogs. Distection. ligatures upon the aorta of the dog, and found that the blood was readily carried by anastomos- ing vessels to the posterior extremities of the animal. Of which experiments an account has been published in the Medico-Chirurgical Trans- actions. , The incision was, in each experiment, made on the left side of the spine, the aorta was drawn to the surface of the skin by an aneurismal nee- dle, and all the surrounding parts being separat- ed from the vessel, so as to perfectly bare its coats, a ligature was applied around it. An animal under these circumstances was kept for a few weeks, and then killed : being injected and dissected, the lumbar arteries, which were considerably enlarged, were found to be the chief agents of the new’ circulation. We have a beautiful preparation in the collection at St. Thomas’s Hospital, shewing the obliterated aorta, and the numerous and enlarged anasto- mosing vessels which carried on the circulation; thus establishing, as far as analogy could go, the possibility of the blood being transmitted in a similar manner in the human subject. I shall now proceed to detail the circum- stances of the case wdiich forms the principal ob- ject of this Paper, leaving the remarks upon the kind of ligature to be employed till a descrip- tion of the operation has been given.

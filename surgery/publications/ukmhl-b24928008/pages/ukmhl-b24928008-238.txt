ON EXOSTOSIS. 7 face of the swelling, to which it firmly adheres. The tumor itself occupies a great extent of sur- face between the shell of the bone and the in- ternal surface of the periosteum. The swelling is lobulated : the greater part of it is composed of a white substance, somewhat elastic, but not so firm as common cartilage: part of it is coloured by blood, and the texture of this part is softer than the rest. When injected it shews a very unequal vascularity; being in some parts rendered extremely red by the in- jection, and in others remaining white; and this 1 have observed to be the case with fun- gous swellings generally, that they are only partially organized. In their incipient state, spicLila of bone have not yet been formed in j them; but in proportion to their extent and j duration the ossific process occurs, though the | spicula are smaller and less numerous than in j the cartilaginous exostosis. In one specimen, it appears that a small portion of this fun- gous substance is thrown out upon the exter- rj nal surface of the periosteum. The medul- | lary membrane and cancellated structure of i the bone in these specimens, have not under- L gone a similar change to that which has taken ^ place upon the external surface ; but in one of the specimens, there are distinct marks of in- flammation in the medullary membrane, and in ji another, this membrane is beginning to partici- pate in the disease. The surface of the exos- tosis viewed by the microscope exhibits numer- ous vascular pores. This disease is attributed to accident; but

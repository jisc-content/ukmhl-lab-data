ON EXOSTOSIS. 199 .any irritation upon a bone in an unhealthy con- stitution will produce it. We have a very fine ?|specimen of it in the collection of Guy’s Hos- pital arising from an internal exfoliation of the os femoris: between the periosteum and the 'bone, in this case, instead of the cartilaginous process which accompanies internal exfoliation, ;an immense fungus is thrown out between the periosteum and the surface of the bone, shew- ing that the nature of the inflammation is de- ;termined by the state of the constitution at the nnaoment, and that a very unusual and malignant ^effect may be produced by a frequent cause of irritation. The treatment of this complaint is similar to chat required in the fungous exostosis arising from the medullary membrane j but it is only in the first dawn of the disease that we are to ?mtertain any hope of a benign influence from naedicine. It would be dishonest to assert that ,we have a knowledge at present of any me- ilicine having a specific influence over cancer ))r fungus. We may indeed improve the con- stitution a little and keep the disease at bay; 3jut once formed, it proceeds more or less ra- oidly to its fatal termination, unless prevented- :oy the operation of amputation or excision;» which the state of the constitution improved by medicine will render more safe at the moment, iind hold out a better grounded hope for the Internal exfoliation. Treatment the same as in the disease of the medul- lary mem- brane. No remedy for fungus or cancer yet known-

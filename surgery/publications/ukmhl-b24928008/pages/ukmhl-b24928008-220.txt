The surface of the tumor next becomes tuberculated, and these tubercles are tender to the touch; they are also, frequently slightly inflamed on their surfaces. To these appearances succeeds constitutional irritation; the rest becomes broken, the appetite impaired, and the bowels extremely irregulap.. During the continuance of these symptoms many weeks elapse, and, at length, ulceration takes place on the tubercles; the skin secretes pus, but when the swelling itself becomes ex- posed, it discharges a bloody-coloured serum; a fungus then arises, which occasionally bleeds,, sometimes largely; and, as usually happens in the fungous disease, the blood is loose in its; coagulations, and separates a large quantity of serum; the bleeding relieves the painful sen*^ sation, but for a very short time ; indeed^ oniy. for a few hours. The fungus projects considerably; the skin yields very extensively, and at length sloughs take place, by means of which, considerable portions of the swelling are separated, and file disease becomes- so &r diminished ih volum.e^

ON PHYMOSIS 152 Treatment. Elastic ca- theter. will scarcely admit the blunt end of a probe. At other times I have found a deeply ulcerated groove, nearly detaching the glans from the cor- pora cavernosa penis. In the first of the states described, injections of tepid water, or milk and water, beneath the foreskin, and the immersion of the penis three or four times a day in a tepid bath, with a well con- trived support of the part at an angle upwards with the symphysis, constitute the best local treatment. To this the free employment of leeches, will be often found an useful addition, if applied at some distance from the swollen part. As the inflammation subsides, injections of weak goulard wash or the solution of alum or liq. calcis and calomel may be substituted. To reduce the inflammation, and thereby lessen the bulk of the glans, is the indication ; when this is accomplished, the reduction of the phy- mosis follows almost spontaneously. In the second state, in addition to such palliative measures as suggest themselves, as emollient cataplasms and fomentations, if a small elastic gum catheter be introduced into the bladder and retained in it, it wfill remove the danger of ulceration of the urethra, or at least prevent extravasation where ulceration has already begun. This is not a practice indicated by the de- gree of stricture, which is seldom considerable enough to require it; but by the approaching danger of extravasation. It should not there- fore be taken up unless the cellular membrane 3

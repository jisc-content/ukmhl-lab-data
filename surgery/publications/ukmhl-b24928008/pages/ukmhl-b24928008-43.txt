ON DISLOCATIONS. 19 and the ancle is provided with ligaments of the same kind, and of very extraordinary strength, to prevent a dislocation, exposed as it is to the most severe injuries—the bones of this joint often rather break than their ligaments give way—however, in many of the joints, as these ligaments are torn, they afford no resistance to the reduction of dislocation, as in the hip, elbow and wrist; but if one of them remains, it produces some difficulty in the re- duction, as 1 have seen in the knee-joint. The difficulty in reducing dislocation princi- pally arises from the resistance which the muscles give by their contraction, and which is proportioned to the length of time whichlias elapsed from the injury ; therefore it is desira- ble that the attempt at reduction should not be long delayed. The common actions of the muscles are vo- luntary or involuntary, but they have a power of contraction independent of either state. A muscle soon fatigues when excited toe action by volition, and it requires rest. The arm can only be extended for a few minutes at right angles with the body, before it feels a fatigue, which requires suspension of ac- tion. The heart also has its contraction and relaxation. But when a muscle is divided, its parts con- tract, or when the antagonist muscle is cut, the undivided muscle draws the parts into which it is inserted into a fixed situation. Thus, if the biceps muscle be divided, the ■ c 2 Muscles.

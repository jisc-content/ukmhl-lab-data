DEDICATION. VI comfort should every where prevail, and that all the provisions which humanity can suggest, should be made for the accommodation of those whom sickness or accident may consign to your protection. But your benevolence aspires to a wider range: the good which you are appointed to administer, has not been cir- cumscribed within the Walls of your Hos- pitals : for under your auspices. Theatres have been erected. Museums have been founded, and Lectures have been established, which comprehend the whole circle of Medical Science. That you may long continue to watch over these excellent institutions, which you have governed with so much judgment and humanity, is the sincere and ardent wish of, Gentlemen, Your Friends and obedient Servants, ASTLEY COOPEK, ' BENJAMIN TRAVERS. London, Jan. 1, 1818.

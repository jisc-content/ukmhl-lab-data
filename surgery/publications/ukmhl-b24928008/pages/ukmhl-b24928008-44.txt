ON DISLOCATIONS. 20 triceps keeps the arm constantly extended; if the muscles on one side of the face are para- lytic, the opposing muscles draw the face to their side. This contraction is not succeeded by fatigue or relaxation, but will continue an indefinite time, even until the structure of the muscle becomes changed j and its contraction increases daily in its power of resistance from the first occurrence of the accident. Thus it is that when a bone is dislocated, the muscles draw it as far from the joint as the surrounding parts will allow, and there by their contraction they fix it. It is this resistance from muscles, ' aided by their voluntary contraction, which it is the business of the surgeon to counteract. If an extension be made almost immediately after a dislocation has happened, the resistance pro- duced by the muscles is easily overcome; but if the operation is protracted for a few days only, the utmost difficulty occurs in effect- ing it. That the muscles are the chief cause of re- sistance is strongly eyinced, by those cases in which the dislocation is accompanied by injury to any vital organ ; for it is then found, that a very slight force is sufficient to return the bone to its situation. Thus in the man who had an injury to his jejunum and a dislocation of the hip, in the case already mentioned, the bone was restored to its place most easily. With respect to the means to be employed, for reducing dislocations, it is now generally agreed amongst the most eminent surgeons,

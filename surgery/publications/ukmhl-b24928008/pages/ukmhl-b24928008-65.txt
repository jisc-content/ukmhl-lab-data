ON DISLOCATIONS. 41 are turned inwards, but not nearly so much as signs, in the dislocation upwards, and the toe rests against the ball of the great toe of the other foot. When the patient is standing, the toe touches the ground ; but the heel does not quite reach it. The knee is not so much ad- vanced as in the dislocation upwards, but is still brought a little more forward than the other, and is slightly bent. The limb is fixed, 60 that both flexion and rotation are in a great degree prevented. We have a good specimen in the collection at i^'ssecUon. St. T' omasâ€™s Hospital, which I met with acci- dentally in a subject brought for dissection. The original acetabulum is entirely filled with a ligamentous substance, so that the head of the bone could hot have been received into it. The capsular ligament is torn from its connection with the acetabulum, at its anterior and poste- rior junction, but not at its superior uiid infe- rior. The Jigamentum teres is broken, and an inch of it adheres still to tlie head of the bone. Tiie head of the bone rests behind the acetabu- lum on the p^wfbrmis muscle, at the edge of the notch above the sacro-sciatic ligaments. The muscle on which it rests is diminished, but there has been no attempt made to torm a new socket in bone for tlie head of the o.> femoris. Around the head of the thigh-bone a new capsular ligament is formed; it does not ad* here to the articulatoiy cartilage of the ball of the bone wly^^h it surrounds, but could, when opened, be turned back to tlie neck of the thigh-bone, so as to leave its head completely

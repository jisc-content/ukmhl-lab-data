267 LIGATURES OF VEINS. Writers on this subject says, “ Inflammation freqiieiiily produces,thickening of the coats of the veins, as well as adhesion of their sides and obliteration of their cavities and again, “ A frequent cause of the obliteration of the cavity of a vein is the adhesion of its sides, in con- sequence of inflammation of its lining mem- brane.”—“ By placing the opposite sides of the cavity in contact, by means of compresses iand bandages, the adhesion of the opposite sides of the dilated vessel is effected, and its cavity is consequently obliterated.”—When a vein is tied with a thin ligature, the internal surface of the vessel is lacerated, inflammation takes place, and, if the opposite sides of the tube be retained in contact by compression, their adhesion is speedily accomplished*'.” I have transcribed these opinions, considering them to be those received by the profession, and shall refer to them, after stating the results of my own inquiry.

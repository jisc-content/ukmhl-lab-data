71 ON IRITIS. poison upon the system can be a cause of the iritis which so often follows its use, we should bear in mind that although we rarely see the disease unpreceded by mercury, we as rarely ^ see it unpreceded by primary symptoms of lues. It would be unfair to refer it to one ra- ther than the other as far as this evidence goes. . But 1 have satisfied myself of the frequent origin of the disease, while the system has been fully charged with mercury; the sore on the penis for which it was exhibited having long since healed, and no after symptoms of lues being to be discovered. I have also seen it where the system had been mercurialized for gonorrhoea. During the free exhibition of calomel in stru- mous inflammation, I have repeatedly seen the , ^ iris take on the inflammatory action, and while the cure of the iritis was daily accomplishing by the action of mercury in one eye, it has been common to observe the inflammation beginning in the other, as if the action produced effects diametrically opposite upon the sound and the inflamed part. When a person is attacked with ophtlialmia, whose system is charged with mer- cury, the inflammation is never confined to the conjunctiva, but invariably affects the deeper tunics, so far as yny observation goes. Yet I have never seen the iris affected in cases of ec- zema mercuiiale, but always the conjunctiva of the eyelids. With what I have considered to be the mercurial sore throat, very unlike the vene- real, and mercurial eruptions, and nodes, I have repeatedly seen it in conjunction. But, with ]v/V - one exception, I do not call to mind a well as- i certained case of primary iritis, during the con- 1 V Yi

Xlll PREFACE. ror. In pursuit of this main object, it is the determination of the Writers to avoid all invi- tation to controversial discussion; and while they endeavour “ studiis et rebus honestis'" to deserve the goodwill of their professional brethren, they will rather submit to be the sub- jects than the authors of critical animadversion. For the literary composition of the Work, its nature and their avocations will, they trust, render apology unnecessary—the value of the matter will be their more particular concern. The delineation of morbid parts will be given in the form of slight engraving, in the hope of ren- dering the Work less exptrrrsive and more ex- tensively iiacffll. The motive which has induced the Authors to execute this Work conjointly, is, the oppor- tunity which it furnished of giving to the public the more extended experience, derived from the practice of the two Hospitals; and they hope soon to be enabled to publish a second Part, but the period of publication must for the present be left undetermined.

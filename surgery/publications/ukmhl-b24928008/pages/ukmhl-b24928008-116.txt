78 OxM IRITIS. CASE. erupt’ioTs? March 23, 1816.—James Basnell, aged 40, after sore had a soi’c OH the Hps of the urethra five months onthepenis. tt • • i i i t . . ago. He IS not certain whether the medicine he took was mercurial; his mouth was not affected. Three months afterwards an eruption appeared on his breast; this is now generally diffused over the body j it is small, elevated, scaly, and of a pale brown colour. About a month after the ap- pearance of the eruption, the left eye became in- flamed. Topical means were chiefly employed, and the inflammation gradually subsided, but the vision was lost. At present the iris adheres to the opaque capsule of the lens, the pupil is mis- shapen and fixed, and whitish radii are percepti- ble upon the iris converging to the pupil. Three weeks since the right eye inflamed. The con- junctiva is red, and the vessels are most con- densed around the cornea. Upon the iris, which is very vascular, they are seen passing, like rays to a centre, to the contracted pupil. Flakes of lymph appear upon the iris, and there is one re- markable lump which nearly reaches the cornea, and is reddened around its base, as if beginning to be organized. Although the cornea is clear, the humors appear thick, and the vision is much impaired. He has little if any pain from expo- sure to light, but much at night.

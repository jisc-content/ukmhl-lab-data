I LIGATURES OF VEINS. resting case of inflammation, apparently origina- ting in the uterine veins after recent delivery^. The inflammation extended to the iliac veins s and their communications, and throughout the vena cava inferior, as far as to the entrance of the venae cavae hepaticae. The coats of these veins were much thickened, and their canals, plugged by coagula. From the emulgent veins downward, the cava was filled by lymph adhe- ring to its sides. An abscess containing four ounces of well formed pus was discovered be- tween the emulgent and hepatic veins. Imme- diately below the entrance of the latter, the tube of the cava was obliterated, partly by a pucker- ing or contraction, and in part by a deposition of lymph. Mr. Wilson observed similar appear- ances of inflammation commencing in the veins of the uterus, and extending to the cava, in the bodies of two other women who died, a few days after parturition ; and Dr. Clarke men- tions that he has found pus in the uterine veins in cases of puerperal inflammation t. In the horse the disease, though common, Jnflnm?(i is very rarely fatal. This point I ascertained veins of by inquiry of persons who have very extensive opportunities of treating the diseases of these animals. And the insusceptibility of adhesive inflammation which belongs to the integument of the horse, is thought satisfactorily to explain its origin. My esteemed friend.

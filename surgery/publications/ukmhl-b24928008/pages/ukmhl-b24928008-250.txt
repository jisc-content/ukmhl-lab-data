Those who are attentive in observing disease must have seen enlargements of the i fibula at its lower part, frequently succeeding considerable exertions in walking, pending, or 5 immediately succeeding to, a long continued course of mercury, as 1 have already observed.

I have seen likewise an exostosis of the metacarpal bone of the little finger occasioned by a sharp blow. Pressure is also sometimes a cause of exos- tosis : Mr. Cline, Mr. Hutchinson, and myself,^ were consulted respecting a tumor of this kind, upon the symphysis of the lower jaw, which owed its origin to a considerable degree of pres- sure long applied to the chin. The periosteal exostosis admits of remedy, from internal medicine, from external applica- tions, and when considerably advanced, from surgical operation. The internal and local treatment of these cases differs in no respect from that which we have already given, when speak- ing of the medullary exostosis.

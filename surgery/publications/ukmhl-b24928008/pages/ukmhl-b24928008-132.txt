94 ON IRITIS. Modus operand! of mercur}'. without alw^ays sufficiently regarding the texture of the part inflamed, the character of the in- flammation, and the actual state of the consti- tution But whether the action of mercury, by rous- ing the absorbent vessels, serves as a vehicle to the morbid poison, and modifies its effects on the system—or whether this be a simple inflamma- tion excited by mercury, as we observe fever to be—or an inflammation peculiar to a cachexia, which its use has engendered, the fact that the disease yields to its discreet exhibition cannot be controverted. Nor is its efficacy less in cases to which no suspicion of syphilis or mercury in the system can attach; for example, where the iritis is obviously an extension of unchecked superficial ophthalmia, a very frequent case; or where the affection is at first proper to the iris, the external inflammation being secondary and sympathetic. From the facts which I have stated, one or two inferences are deducible, too important to be overlooked. 1st. The view, which, in the cases of iritis, we are enabled to take of the operation of mer- cury upon a part undergoing the adhesive in- flammation, ought not to be confined to this case; it must be capable of extension and application to other organs in a similar condition. It af- fords demonstration the most palpable of its power to alter the action of the extreme vessels, which are the instruments of morbid changes in * See Observations on Phymosis in another part of this volume.

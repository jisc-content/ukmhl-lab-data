ON EXOSTOSIS. 182 Situation of blood-ves- sels and nerves. Periosteum. The large blood-vessels are next observed to be carried, as well as the muscles, to the vicinity of the surface of the limb—we have a curious specimen in the collection at Guy’s, shewing this change in the situation of the vessels, in which the arteries have been injected—in the same manner the nerves are likewise removed from their natural seat. Under the muscles appears the periosteum, which is separated to different distances from the bone; iti some parts of the swelling to two or three inches. The tumor next appears composed of lobu- lated masses of various colours, consistence, and materials. A part is yellow like fat, part a sub- stance resembling brain, and a third part com- posed of coagulated blood, with interstices con- taining serum. In some parts the white sub- stance is found firm, nearly as much so as car- tilage, but in general it is of a more spongy ap- pearance, and contains spicula of bone within it. The shell of the bone itself is in some parts absorbed, in others it is only thinner than usual; in some cases it has been seen immensely ex- panded, so as to form a case like wire-work over the tumor (See Plate); in others it is only absorbed on one side by the pressure of the swelling. (See Plate.) In those instances in which fungous granulations arise from the medullary membrane, these are exceedingly vascular, very soft in their texture, secrete abundantly, and are sufficiently luxuriant to rise from the cavity of the bone considerably above the level of the skin.

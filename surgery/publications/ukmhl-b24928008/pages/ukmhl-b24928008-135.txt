ON IRITIS. Dear Travers, I am glad to travel a part of the way with you as a former colleague, for whom I entertain so high a regard. We are mainly indebted to John Hunter for directing our attention to the action of the ca- pillary arteries, a knowledge essential to medi- cine and surgery, considered as a science.

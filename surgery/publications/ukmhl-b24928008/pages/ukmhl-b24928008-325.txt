In most of the cases examined, the wound has been found en- larged by ulceration, and converted into one of a circular figure, as delineated in fig. 2, plate 10, or the tube has been deficient from the ex- tent of ulceration at the part where the wound had been inflicted. The tendency of the wound to ulcerate after the application of a ligature, is shewn in White’s case; and in all these cases the inflammatory action takes place, as Mr. Hunter, whom nothing escaped, likewise ob- served, between the wounded or tied part and the heart: the obliteration where that has p^'‘tera- tion gene- been effected, or the attempt at it, is likewise miiynext found on the side of the heart *. The ulcera- tive inflammation upon the edges of the wound destroys the process b}^ which the reparation is effected, and which by the eversion of the edges and the presence of the clot is rendered in a degree extraneous to the canal; and it is there- fore a cause of irritation abundantly sufficient for the excitement of continuous inflammation, to which we see that this membrane is so re- markably disposed. Thus “ the imperfection of union is continued on to the cavity of the vein,” and if the presence of a thrombus in excess, the breaking of the agglutination and the ne- cessary displacement of the clot by secondary bleedings, casual or designed, the immediate and unguarded exercise of the limb, the friction of ithe wound in the skin, or the applicationpfadhe- • This was the case in the horse’s vein, described at page 2j6. It constitutes an exception to the results of Professor 'Coleman’s observation.

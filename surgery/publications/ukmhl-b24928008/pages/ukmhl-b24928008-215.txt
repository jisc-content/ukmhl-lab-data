We have beside an im- mense exostosis occupying the superior half of the os humeri, excepting that the cartilaginous head of the bone is unaffected. The particu- lars of this case will be hereafter detailed. There is also, in the same Museum, a hu- merus with the shell of the bone considerably expanded, the periosteum over it thickened, and in the seat of the cancellated structure several hydatids had formed, which had been the cause of the enlargement of the exterior sur- face of the bone as w^ell as of the increase of its cavity.

On the radius we have an excellent prepara- Radius, tion of this disease growing to an enormous size, ulcerated upon its surface, and that ulceration having gone on to sloughing; thus exposing the exostosis. This case occurred in Saint Thomas’s Hospital, where the arm of the man ’ was obliged to be amputated in order to pre- serve life. We have also a fine specimen of exostosis upon the metacarpal bones growing to a very con- Metacafpai siderable magnitude ; a section of which shews ' extremely well the internal structure of the disease. f A young friend of mine has an exostosis Fingers, growing on the metacarpal bone of the little finger, which undoubtedly arose from a blow. I have twice removed an exostosis from the

ON IRITIS. 74. sels being exchanged for one of a deeper and more purple cast. The vessels on' the sclerotic run in converging lines from all sides of the vi- sible hemisphere of the globe, and form a're- markable vascular zone at the circumference of the cornea. This appearance is probably in- creased by the turgescence of the vessels of the ciliary plexus, and the preternatural freedom of anastomosis between the superficial and deeper seated orders. The pupil is square, ob- long, rhomboidal or a polygon, and a boss or tubercle of lymph is deposited upon one or each . of the angles which are formed in its margin. Sometimes one large projecting lump is seen ; in other cases the whole rim of the pupil is fantasti- cally fringed or tufted. The lymph is sometimes deposited upon the centre of the iris, sometimes on the verge of the pupil, seldom on its ciliary border. In this state the pain is that of hemicra- nia, aggravated by paroxysms, and most intoler- able at night. Chronic There is a slow inflammation of the iris which diseL*f differs from the acute form, chiefly in its very gra- dual access, its comparatively moderate pain, and that affecting only the ball and region of the or- bit ; the very slight degree of superficial vascula- rity; the membranous form and sparing^quantity of lymph effused, or its actual imperceptibleness; the frequent concomitant affection of the cornea with minute and superficial herpetic ulcers, of a brown colour. The iris loses its colour more or less under inflammation, and where lymph has been deposited and organized upon the uvea, ne- ver recovers it; the pigmentum nigrum, upon

ON EXOSTOSIS. 171 and is found to proceed through the inner table of the skull, occasioning disease of the dura mater: and by its pressure upon the brain to produce a diseased state of the functidns of that organ, by which means life is destroyed. Exostosis of the facial bones is of very fre- quent occurrence. We have in the collection at St. Thomas’s a skull which I took from a fish woman who died in that Hospital, who had long been remarkable, (even at Billingsgate,) for her hideous appearance. Two large swell- ! ings had been formed under the orbits in the fore part of the cheeks, between which the nose appeared wedged, and the nostrils were closed ; each eye projected considerably from its socket, i This person was seized with a fit, which seemed i to be of an apoplectic nature, and in that state i was brought to St. Thomas’s Hospital, where j she almost immediately died. Upon examina- i tion of the head, an exostosis was found growing I from each antrum, and forming the large swell- ings upon the cheeks : these also projected into the orbits so as to occasion the protrusion of the eyes. On the left side the exostosis entered the cranium, projected inwards through the orbitar process of the os frontis, and occasioning such pressure upon the brain, as, under a con- siderable excitement of the vessels of that organ, to .produce apoplexy, which proved fatal to her. The alveolar processes of the upper and lower jaw, are very frequently the seat of this disease ; and 1 have at present in Guy’s Hospital, an ex- ample of exostosis of the lower jaw springing from the medullary membrane and cancellated Bones of the face.

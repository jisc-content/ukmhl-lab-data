ON DISLOCATIONS. head of the thigh-bone can be perceived during rotation of the knee inwards, moving upon the ■ dorsum of the ilium, and the trochanter major advances towards the spinous process of the ilium, so as to be felt much nearer to it than usual. The trochanter is less prominent than that on the opposite side, for the neck of the bone and the trochanter are resting in the line of the surface of the dorsum ilii: upon a comparison of the two hips, the roundness of the dislocated side has disappeared. A sur- geon then, called to a severe and recent in- jury of the hip-joint, looks for a difference in length, change of position inwards, dimi- nution of motion, and decreased projection of the trochanter. The accident with which the dislocation upwards is liable to be con- founded, is the fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, within the capsular ligament. Yet the marks of distinction are generally suffi- ciently strong to prevent an error in a person commonly attentive. In a fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, the knee and foot are gene- rally turned outwards : the trochanter is drawn backwards: the limb can be readily bent to- wards the abdomen, although with some pain t but above all, the limb which is shortened from one to two inches, by the contraction of the muscles, can be made of the length of the other by a slight extension, and when the extension is abandoned, the leg is again shortened. If when extended the limb is rotated, a crepitus can often be felt, which ceases when rotation • is performed under a shortened state of the

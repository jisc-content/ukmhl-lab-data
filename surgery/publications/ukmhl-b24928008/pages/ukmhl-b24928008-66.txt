! 42 ON DISLOCATIONS. 6an!^p. exposed. Within this new capsular ligament which is formed of the surrounding cellular membrane, the broken ligamentum teres is found. (See Plate.) The trochanter major is rather behind the acetabulum, but a little in- clined towards it. This dislocation must have existed, from the appearances of the parts, a length of time ; the adhesions were too strong to have admitted of any reduction, and, if re- duced, the bone could not have remained in its Original socket. This dislocation is produced by force, being applied when the body is bent forward upon the thigh, or when the thigh is bent towards the abdomen ; when, if the knee be pressed inward, the head of the bone is thrown behind the acetabulum. Reduction. The reduction of the dislocation in the ischi- •» atic notch is generally extremely difficult, and is best effected in the following manner ; the patient lies on a table upon his side, and a girt | is to be placed between the pudendum and the inner part of the thigh to fix the pelvis. Then the leather strap for the pullies is placed above the knee, upon which a wetted roller is tightly applied. A napkin is to be carried under the upper part of the thigh. The thigh-bone is then brought across the middle of the other thigh, measuring from the pubis to the knee,and the ex- i tension is to be made with the pullies. Whilst this is conducting, an assistant pulls the napkin at the upper part of the thigh with one hand, and rests the other upon the brim of the pelvis, and thus lifts the bone as it is drawn towards the aceta- J

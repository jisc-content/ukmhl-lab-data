The coats of arteries are subject to ossific inflammation and deposition to an,unlimited ex- tent. Those of veins are very rarely the seat of this, and never, so far as I have observed, continuously, as we see in arteries. 2. In their disposition to inflame, as well as in other particulars, veins resemble absorbents ; but the cases of inflamed vein bear no com- parison in point of frequency to those of in- flamed absorbents. It has been observed, that a wound of the same extent, and inflicted with the same instrument as that made in blood-let- ting, does not cause the extensive inflammation which we occasionally see it produce in veins, in any other texture of the body. This, how- ever, if we consider the frequency of venesec- tion and the rarity of these cases, can scarcely be admitted. The cellular membrane, the fas- cia, and especially the absorbents, inflame at least as frequently as the veins, and not less extensively from slight injuries, for example, ifrom venesection, and from small wounds of the extremities. 3. The most material fact, however it may be â€¢ explained, is this : the inner or lining mem- brane of veins is subject to diffused or continu- <ous inflammation ; that of arteries very rarely, iif ever. I am aware that a preternatural red- mess of the interior surface is sometimes ob- 5served to run through the course of an artery.. 263 Differences in patho- logy.

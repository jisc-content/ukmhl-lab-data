87 ON IRITIS. tions, reduced by absorption and deep ulcers filling with granulation—nay, who has not seen one ulcer cicatrizing, and another sloughing, on the penis or pudendum of the same indivi- dual ? The effects of local applications place this fact in a more striking point of view. We inject a transparent ulcer upon the cornea with a solution of caustic; lymph is thrown out, and it heals. We inject the cornea rendered opaque by a redundant deposition of lymph, v/ith the same solution ; the lymph is absorbed, and it becomes clear. Now in either of these cases a contrary effect would be produced, if the re- medy were resorted to at an improper time—- viz.: the ulcer would increase, and the opacity become more dense. But there, is another, and perhaps more con- sistent explanation of these phenomena, since it does not require that the remedy should possess opposite modes of action. It is this: the changes which parts undergo in the commencement of the healing process, are not in fact opposed and dissimilar, as the conditions of the parts appear to be. The absorbents, for example, are set to work to level the thick, abrupt, callous edges of ulcers, and thus to prepare or put them in a state for healing. This, it will be admitted, is as obvious an effect of mercury as the absorption of simple depositions without laesion. The granulation from the bed of the ulcer is an after-process— an action of healing which, follows as a natural effect of tlie salutary change which has taken place in the circumference. Thus, the filling up of the breach is an act of the constitution,

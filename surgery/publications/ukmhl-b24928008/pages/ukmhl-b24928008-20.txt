They are, therefore, disposed to think that occurrences, which by reason of their fre- quency attract less notice than they deserve, may yet be found to contain important matter for consideration. How much additional value the relation of an ordinary case acquires when supported and illustrated by others nearly resembling it, is too obvious to require exemplification. It is only in the assemblage and multiplication of facts that their proper bearing can be seen, and their real value ascertained; or that they can be ad- mitted to form a safe groundwork for the super- structure of theory. In the present undertaking, it is perhaps needless to say, that no attempt will be made improperly to bias the public judgment. The cases of failure will be as fully detailed as those of which the issue is fortunateâ€”the errors will be as faithfully exposed as the merits of prac- tice, and the progress of truth shall not be re- tarded by the disingenuous concealment of er- * The case of Ligature of the Aorta is an obvious excep- tion to this remark.

7^ or predis- position from iner- eury. ON IRITIS. stitutional action of mercury for a disease in which the genitals had had no concern, as en- largement of the liver, &c. Were it not for this observation, one would be led to conclude that mercury in certain habits affected the highly organized membranes of the eye, as we occa- sionally see it affect the skin, and as other sub- stances, by whatever channel they enter the sys- tem, attack certain organs and parts; as cantha- rides and turpentine the neck of the bladder, arsenic the stomach,and lead the intestinal canal. Whether the iritis followino; the use of mer- cury is simply an effect of accidental exposure to cold, and other exciting causes in a state pe- culiarly susceptible of inflammation, or whether it be due to a cachexia, which the poison of sy- philis or of mercury or both have engendered, is a remaining ground of inquiry. The pains, I have repeatedly observed, which accompany this inflammation, are of a rheuma- tic character, exclusively affecting the joints and muscles ; in general an interval or intervals have elapsed, in the progress of an ill-conducted or protracted course, in which the patient has been exposed to cold and damp before the appearance 'â€¢ of the disease, and hence it is least frequent in the better class of patients. And although I have sometimes found sores on the penis and buboes in company with the iritis, the pains, or eruptions, or both have usually been present, and the patient has been more or less under the influence of mercury before the' eye was in- flamed. The inflammation of the eye and erup- tions, which yield eventually to the same re- medy, are subject to relapse, and make their

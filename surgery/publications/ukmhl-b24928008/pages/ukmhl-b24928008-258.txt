ON EXOSTOSIS. 2 IS Stair; and the same in descending, when she was obliged to proceed sideways, being unable, without great inconvenience, to bend the limb. Whilst sitting down, and more especially on a low seat, she felt considerable pain in bending the knee : and after having sat tor some time, she experienced pain and difficulty on rising. Her lameness, just before her journey to Lon- - don, had considerably increased, and her leg had become painful down to the heel. When she attempted to run, she felt a snap upon the swelling, as if a cord had slipped out of its pulley, which was owing to the tendon gliding over the projecting part of the bone. On Monday, tlie 21st of July, an operation was performed for the purpose of removing the swelling, in the presence of Mr. Prior and Mr. Plowman. An incision was made over the pro- jecting portion of the bone, and the muscles drawn aside from its surface : the periosteum, which was much thicker than usual, was divided by the knife, and turned aside from the exosto- sis, which was covered by a bed of cartilage, in which bony matter had not yet been de- posited ; and this was about the thickness of |- of an inch. The exostosis was next cleared of the soft parts from the surface of the thigh-bone upon.which it grew, and a spatula was passed down to confine the muscles from interfering with the saw. The saw was then attempted to be used without the forceps, but it could not be well fixed : the forceps were therefore added to it, and the bone was sawn through. Some irregularity remained upon the thigh-bone.

207 ON EXOSTOSIS. The next part of the operation consisted in the gradual division of the muscles surroundins: o o the joint, and the application of ligatures to such vessels as it appeared at all probable might furnish free haemorrhage. These, being nu- merous and large, in consequence of the great size of the tumor, it became necessary to se- cure ten arteries. As a further precaution also against any bleeding which might have taken place, either from returning vessels, owing to the circulation kept up by undivided branches of arteries, or from regurgitation, the veins accompanying the axillary and posterior cir- cumflex arteries were tied by two ligatures each, and divided at the intervening space. The capsular ligament being at length laid bare, an incision was made into it, and the cavity of the joint exposed, which was filled with coagulable lymph, of a reddish co- lour, and gelatinous consistence, mixed with some serum or synovia. The arm being re- moved, the glenoid cavity was accurately exa- rmined, and presented no mark of disease : the iinternal surface of the capsular ligament was rmore vascular than natural, but the articulating •surfaces were not destroyed. The cartilage was pared from the glenoid cavity, in order to fa- ccilitate the process of granulation ; and after aill haemorrhage was stopped, the integuments vwere brought togetlier, and secured in appo- sition, by three sutures and straps.” It is not necessary here to detail the circum- dlstances of the case subsequent to the operation,

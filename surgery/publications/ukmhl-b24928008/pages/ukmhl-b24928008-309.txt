This corresponds with our observation of the difference in this respect presented by the bounded and the undefined inflammation of joints, the peritoneal or the pleural ca\dties, and the other shut sacs of the body. 8. The constitutional symptoms excited by inflamed veins resemble in type those of diffused inflammations in other organs. They are simi- lar to those of inflamed absorbents, which ves- sels also resemble the veins in their disposition to continuous inflammation. Bichat has a remarkable passage on the dis- position of the venous texture to inflammation, which I translate literally, as follows :—“ The tissue of these vessels frequently inflames. Bell relates examples of its following external injuries. The inflammation of haemorrhoids is a circum- stance commonly known. The cicatrization of w’ounds of veins after bleeding is a result of in- flammation. The process of cicatrization in veins is doubtless assisted by the absence of the impulse, to which the arteries are subjected; but certainly the latter, under'the same circum- stances, would not heal so quickly, if at all. When an artery is tied, its walls brought into contact, inflamed, and often torn by the ligature, must adhere before the cure can be completed, and the ligature come away without danger. Now nothing is slower and more difficult of oc- currence than their adhesion, on account of the indisposition of the arterial tissue to inflamma- tion. To this may be attributed the haemor- Bichat’s re- marks on the disposi- tion of veins to inflame.

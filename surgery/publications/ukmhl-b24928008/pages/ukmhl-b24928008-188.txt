148 ON PHYMOSIS Paraphy- m*sts. Erysipelatous inflammation with considerable oedema, and the anasarcous swelling of the pre- puce, are occasional causes of the paraphymosis. But it is, for the most part, an artificial or acci- dental, not a natural morbid condition, if we ex- cept the cases of malformation or the destruction of a portion of the prepuce by former sores. It is, therefore, much less frequent than the phy- mosis. The patient, anxious to prevent or to remedy the incipient phymosis, produces the contrary state. There is the same oedematous tumefaction of the prepuce and glans, and if. allowed to continue until the supervention of the adhesive stage, it is attended by some of the evils described as consequent upon the phymosis, both being equally cases of stricture. But the pain of paraphymosis, and the obvious inconve- nience and deformity of a permanently exposed glans, and enormously enlarged prepuce, bring it sooner to notice, and it is so easily reduced by the aid of timely scarifications of the swollen prepuce, fomentations, and compression of the glans, that it is rarely suffered to remain unre- lieved. Besides, the exposure of the glans re- moves the peculiar circumstances by which the phymosis is rendered of such formidable conse-. quence. Heister says, that the paraphymosis is fre- quently produced in coitu^ where the penis is larger, or the vagina is smaller tlian usual, and comments on the injustice of the suspicions which newly married men have inferred of the chastity of their wives, from a circumstance which warrants the very opposite inference.

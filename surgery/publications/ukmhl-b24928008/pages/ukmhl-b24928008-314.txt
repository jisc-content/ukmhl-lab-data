It forms, when the vein is filled, a pouch or bag ; and the jugular veins of horses present many of these contiguous to each other*.— Farriers avoid bleeding in these pouches, be- cause they find it difficult to staunch the blood. I at first supposed that this was a condensed cellular membrane, formed by the sheath of the vein; but I am satisfied that it is conti- nuous with the everted edges of the internal tunic, and organized by its vessels. If it were consistent with what we know of reproduction, I should be disposed to conclude that the new membrane was formed out of the coagulum of blood, although I found that the coagulum could with care be detached from the membrane, which was continuous with the everted edge of the interior tunic. The new membrane is how- ever evidently denser than the valves in struc- ture, which are said to be prolongations or even duplicatures of the proper tunic. Let us compare for a moment this account of the'process of healing in veins with that which prevails in arteries, as related by that accurate ob- server, Jones. An artery bleeds, it is well known, upon receiving a wound, in whatever direction, by the impulse of the heart’s action. From the difference of structure and circulation between the arteries and veins, a certain difference of course results as regards the approximation of • See Plate 11, fig. 6.

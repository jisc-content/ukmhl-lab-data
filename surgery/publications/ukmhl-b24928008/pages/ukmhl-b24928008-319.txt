LIGATURES OF VEINS. 27*^ of an incl), and fastened by adhesion to the cellu- lar siieath, which was much extended and thicks- ened by a subjacent deposition of lymphs so as to form a smooth solid bed between the divided ends of the vein. The internal membrane of the superior portion of the vein had a thin ragged edge where it had been severed by ulceration. The lower edge was smooth and blended in with the bed of the wound. The extremities had undergone no contraction but that produced by the adhesion of the severed extremity to the sheath. The portion of the vein next the heart was empty. The upper was tilled by a dark lamellated coagulum of blood, adhering very strictly to the internal tunic which was discoloured by it. On carefully separating the outer lamella which coated the interior of the vein, I could'not discover any thickening of the proper coats of the vein, nor any appearance of inflammatory action within its canal, nor was any such appearance indicated in the lower por- tion of the vein*. The effect of a ligature upon an artery is so 'well known, from the attention of late years di- ii^cted to the subject, that it cannot be necessary to dwell upon it for the purpose of shewing the contrast which it offers to the process just de- ^scribed. The internal tunic of an artery is divided by iSL round ligature, such as I employed, in these (experiments. The contraction of the tube at ilhe place of the ligature is rendered permanent Iby a deposition of lymph between its coats. * See Plate IS. T 2

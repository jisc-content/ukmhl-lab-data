147 AND PARArHYMOSIS. cellular tissue disposes it upon very slight irri- tation, as gonorrhoeal inflammation, or an exco- riation, sore, or pimple upon the prepuce. The increased influx and retarded efflux of blood are promoted by the natural depending posture of the penis, a condition for the same reason most unfavourable to healing. The glans, compressed by the enlargement of the hood of the prepuce, which by the continuance of inflammation be- comes a solid substantial enlargement, shrinks away from the aperture of the prepuce, and be- comes buried in its folds. In either case the profuse and incessant dis- J''® , ^ . nnement of charge of gonorrhoeal matter is pent up, and lies the matter, in the plies and folds of the membrane, which is reflected from the prepuce over the glans penis. This matter is often furnished by the inflamed surface of the corona glandis and prepuce, and sometimes the gonorrhoea is altogether external. The chaps and abrasions, which often accom- pany a gonorrhoea from its commencement, of : the fine cuticular covering of these parts, are ■ irritated and ulcerate ; and when the inflam- imation is subdued, and the discharge furnished iby the sores is arrested, it is in consequence of ; adhesions which have taken place between the opposite surfaces of the glans and prepuce, .and thus a permanent phymosis is the cost of (Cure. These incipient states of the phymosis are ge- inerally uncombined, but it is easy to see that tthey may co-exist, as they of necessity do in a rmore advanced stage j and this is not unfre- I quently the case.

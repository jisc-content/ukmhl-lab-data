ON THE AORTA. 123 lobe much collapsed. In each side of the thorax there was a small quantity of bloody serum.” After the aorta has formed its curvature, it gives off numerous intercostal arteries within the cavity of the chest; and though these ves- sels are small, they communicate so freely with each other, that under a gradual obliteration of the aorta, the blood would be still readily trans- mitted to the inferior parts of the body. An ex- ample of this kind is related by Mr. Paris, and is quoted by Mr. John Bell, in his Surgical Ob» servations. “ Mr. Paris, Dissector of the Amphitheatre of Mr. Paris’s the Hotel Dieu, in the year 1789, injected the body of a very lean old woman, about 50 years of age, whose arterial system was found to be singularly deranged, and the circle of the blood changed altogether by a complete con- traction of the aorta a little beyond the arch. Mr. Paris had his attention particularly excited to the condition of this subject by the unac- countable enlargement of the small arteries upon the fore part of the chest. He had filled the ar- teries with an injection composed of equal parts of suet and resin, coloured with lamp-black ; and this injection, thrown in from the mouth of the aorta, passed along so easily, that far from sus- pecting an obliteration, he felt that he could have thrown in more injection than is usually required for filling an adult body. The subject was so meagre, that, without dis- secting, Mr. Paris felt the thoracic arteries run-

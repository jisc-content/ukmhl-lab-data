ON DISLOCATIONS. 11 Juced. In these cases no laceration of the liga- inentscan have occurred, and they shew the in- fluence of the musqles in preventing dislocation from violence, and in impeding its reduction.

Dislocations are often^companied with frac- ture. At the ancle-joint it rarely happens that dislocation occurs without a fracture of the fibula, and at the hip-joint the acetabulum is every now and then broken, of whiph an exam- ple will be seen in the following CASE. Thomas Steers was admitted into Guy’s Hos- pital on the 28th of October, 1805, with a dis- location of the os femoris into the ischiatic notch. The dislocation .was reduced by a very slight extension compared with that which is com- monly required. This was imputed to his hav- ing vomited at the time of his admission, and to the depression of strength which a state of Dislocation from ulce- ration. Fracture and disloca- tion.

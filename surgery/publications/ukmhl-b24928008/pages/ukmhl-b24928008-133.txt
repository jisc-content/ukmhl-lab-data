Its action on parts disposed to adhesive inflammation, as the serous membranes, is more marked than upon those which tend to the suppurative action; as the mucous. But for the gonorrhoea, in the army and on the conti- nent, the sublimate is still generally employed, and often with success. The effect of mercury as an application, is to excite a brisker action of the vascula minima, and thus it stimulates indolent and ill condi- tioned ulcers to assume a new and florid granu- lating surface, and a healthy secretion. Upon a tumor, whether solid or fluid, the indirect effect of this remedy is to promote its removal by stimulating the absorbents of the neighbouring part. The brisker action of the extreme arteries induces a corresponding ac- tivity of the absorbents, for in proportion as the exhalants are unloaded, it is well known that the avidity of the absorbents is increased. It is common to see people grow fat after a course of mercury. The effect of mercury to excite a new and peculiar action in the capillary system, is as marked upon the constitution as upon the part. It first quickens the heart and pulsating arte- ries, and is a stimulus in this stage which enfee- bled habits but ill support. When it has enter- ed the system, the febrile irritability is allayed, and a general tranquillity prevails, for all the se- cretions of the body are manifestly increased, the biliary and cutaneous especially.

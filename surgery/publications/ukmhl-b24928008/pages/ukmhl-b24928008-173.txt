ON THE AORTA. 133 I f i During the time of the operation, the faeces passed off involuntarily, and the patient’s pulse, both immediately, and for an hour after the operation, was 144 in a minute; he was ordered thirty drops of tincture of opium and campho- rated mixture, and the involuntary discharge of fiEces soon after ceased, I applied my hand to his right thigh immediately after the opera- tion, and he said that I touched his foot; so that the sensibility of that leg was very imper- fect. For the following particulars I am indebted to Mr. William Cox, one of my apprentices. At midnight his pulse was 132. 26.—At 1 o’clock in the morning, the pa- tient complained of heat in the abdomen^ but he felt no pain upon pressure; he said that his head felt hot, and that he had pain in the shoulders; his lower extremities, which were cold soon after the operation, were now regaining their heat; his body was in other parts covered with a cold sweat. The sensibility of the lower extremities has been very indistinct since the operation. At 2 o’clock he felt so comfortable from his medicine that he wished to have more of it, and ten drops of tincture of opium were given him; his legs were wrapped in flannel, bottles of hot water were applied to the feet, and he then said that the heat of his belly was lessened. At 6 o’clock the sensibility of his limbs was still imperfect. At 8 o’clock A. M. he expressed himself as feeling quite comfortable ; he however passed Involun- tary dis- charge of fseces; pulse 144. Imperfect sensibility of the limb. State at one in the morning.

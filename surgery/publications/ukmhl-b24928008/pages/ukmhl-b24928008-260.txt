This tumor gradually increased, and at length began to interfere with the motion of the limb, so as to render him anxious to have advice respecting it. When walking, he felt what he described as a snapping in the part, like a cord slip- ping from a pulley, which probably arose from the extension of the sartorius muscle, and its sudden slipping over the swelling. When he placed the limb quite straight, he found a difficulty in bending it; and when bent it was almost e(jually difficult to extend it; each flex- ion and extension producing a snapping noise, which could be distinctly heard. On considering the inconvenience which the swelling had produced, and that the disease was obviously on the increase, I recommended to him the operation which I had performed in the preceding Case, and advised him to become a patient in the Hospital, and to submit to one of a similar kind. He procured admission im- mediately. On the 22nd of August I performed the operation. The man was lying upon a table with his thigh slightly bent, and I made an incision through the integuments over the swell- ing, and thus exposed the sartorius muscle, which appeared to have gained an increase in its breadth, and to be incapable of being suf- ficientl}^ drawn aside to completely expose the tumor without considerable violence ; 1 there- fore made an incision through it in the direc- tion of its fibres, sufficiently large to allow the exostosis to pass through the opening.

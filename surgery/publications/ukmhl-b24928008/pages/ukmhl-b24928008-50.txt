26 ON DISLOCATIONS. however, is rarely dislocated a second time, but the shoulder and the lower jaw very frequently slip again from their sockets, owing to the little depth of the socket in these joints, and there- fore they require bandages for some time subse- quent to reduction. * On the Dislocations of the Hip-Joint. The acetabulum of the hip-joint is deepened by a cartilaginous edge, which surrounds its brim, and it is made a complete cup in the re- cent subject by another cartilage which fills up a depression in the bone, in the inferior and ante- rior part of tlie cavity. The ligaments are two: the capsular arises from the edge of the acetabulum, and passing over the head and neck of the bone is inserted into the cervix at the rootof the trochanter major; it is thick at its fore part, and thin posteriorly. Strong portions of ligament are extended over it, from the ilium near its anterior and inferior spinous process. The figamentum teres, which is contained within the capsular ligament, proceeds from a depression in the lower and inner part of the acetabulum to be fixed in a hollow upon the inner side of the head of the thigh-bone. The synovial membrane lines the capsular li- gament, and is reflected upon the neck of the thigh-bone, and on the ligamentum teres. The round ligament has a tendency to prevent dis- locations in all directions, but particularly the dislocation downwards. The thigh-bone I have seen dislocated in

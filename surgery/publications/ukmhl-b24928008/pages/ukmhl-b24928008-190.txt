ON PHYMOSIS 150 Ulceration of the pre- puce. Swollen labia, or clitoris and nytnphse of females. Where the glans has originally been the seat of chancre or common superficial sores, the state of tension is relieved by the sloughing of the glans, and the urine infiltrating the elongated prepuce, gives occawsion to circumscribed ulcers of the prepuce, by which it is discharged. The ulceration of the prepuce, from the lodgment and retention of urine within it, where the mouth of it is closed by adhesion, takes place to a greater extent; for the retained urine is extra- vasated into the cells of the connecting mem- brane, and gangrene ensuing, denudes the en- tire body of the penis even to the pubes, The urine passes by ulcerated orifices in the ure- thra, and by the irritation which its constant dribbling creates, the sloughing process is kept up and aggravated. In the debilitated state of the system produced by large quantities of mer- cury, cases now and then occur in hospital prac- tice, in which the whole of the external organ becoming affected with an erysipelatous inflam- mation, gangrenes, and falls oflT from the pubes, leaving only the vestige of the bulb in the form of a fleshy tubercle beneath the symphysis pubis, | from which the urine is discharged. In women, as in men, the gonorrhoea virulenta is generally attended with swelling of the ex- ternal parts. The labia pudendi frequently at- tain an enormous bulk, and very slowly recover their natural size, if they do not advance to sup- puration. Sometimes the swelling exclusively i affects the clitoris, its preputium, and the nym- | phae, which, if not reduced, become dense, hard, and permanent elongations. But the different | structure of the organs occasions a difference in |

LIGATURES OP VEINS. 251 He observed in some parts of veins thus affected, suppuration which had not yet arrived at ulceration, and in several other places ulce- ration had taken place so as to have destroyed the surface next the skin. He always found in cases where larger abscesses had come on than tliose formed simply from ulceration of the wound made by the lancet, that the vein was afterwards obliterated; a proof, he observes,, that the sides of the vein can unite by the ad- I hesive inflammation. Mr. Hunter instances this disease in the horse after bleeding as frequently fatal, and seems to attribute it to the method of closing the external wound, when not executed with 1 sufficient attention. He conjectures the fatal issue of the disease to be owing either to the extension of inflammation to the heart, or the \ passage of a considerable quantity of the matter ! secreted by the inflamed surface into the circu- I lation. I entertain no doubt of the facts stated on sympathe- I the writerâ€™s observation in this very valuable 1 nation of paper ; but when Mr. Hunter says it is so com- mon a case, that he has hardly ever seen an in- stance of suppuration in any part furnished with large veins, where these appearances are not evident after death, we are forced to con- clude that he means to describe a sympathetic inflammation, i. e. one which does not arise out of violence done to the vein, but consentaneous with disease of the surrounding parts; and I if so, there is surely too much latitude in the I statement.

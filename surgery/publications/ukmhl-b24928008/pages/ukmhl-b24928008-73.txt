ON DISLOCATIONS. 49 in a very short time, the head of the bone snapped into its acetabulum. Dr. Dorsey, a most intelligent surgeon in America, who, I sincerely hope, may continue his professional career with the same ardour and good sense which he has hitherto manifested, mentions a case of dislocation on the pubis, in which the head of the thigh-bone was placed be- low Poupart’s ligament, and the leg was longer, but this was an exception to a general rule. Of Fractures of the Os Innommatum, As these accidents are liable to be mistaken for dislocations, and as any extension made for them adds extremely to the patient’s sufferings, and endangers the producing fatal consequences if there was previously a probability of recovery, I am anxious to say a few words upon them at this moment. When a fracture of the os innominatum hap- pens through the acetabulum, the head of the bone is drawn upwards, and the trochanter somewhat forwards, so that the leg is shorten- ed, and the knee and foot are turned inwards : such a case then may be readily mistaken for dislocation. If the os innominatum is disjoint- ed from the sacrum, and the pubis and ischium are broken, the limb is slightly shorter than the other; but in this case the knee and foot are not turned inwards. Of the first of these acci- dents I have seen two examples j of the latter only one. E Mistaken.c Symptoms.

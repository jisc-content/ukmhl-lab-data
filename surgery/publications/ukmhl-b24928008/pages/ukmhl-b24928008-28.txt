ON DISLOCATIONS. 4 Crepitus. Inflamma- tion. a paralysis is produced of the parts below: as is sometimes seen in dislocations of the shoulder. At other times the bone presses upon important parts so as to produce effects dangerous to life. I have for many years mentioned in my Lec- tures a case, of which Mr. Davie of Bungay was so kind as to send me an account, of a dislocated clavicle, which pressed upon the oesophagus so as to endanger life, and" of which I shall give a more detailed history hereafter. The head of the bone can generally be felt in its new situation, excepting in some of the dislo- cations of the hip, and its rotation becomes often the best criterion of the accident. The natural prominences of the bone near the joint, either disappear or become less conspicuous, as the tro- chanter ni the hip-joint. Sometimes the reverse occurs; for, in dislocations of the elbow, the olecranon projects more than usual. The more remote effects of the accident are, first, that there is often a sensation of crepitus produced by the effusion of adhesive matter (albumen) into the joint and bursae, by which the synovia becomes inspissated, and crackles under motion, a circumstance which every prac- titioner should be aware of, as he may be in- duced to suspect the existence of fracture where none has occurred. Tlie degree of inflammation produced is how- ever generally only slight, but sometimes, after the reduction of dislocations suppuration ensues, and the patient dies.

A probe passed from the pulmonary artery along the canalis arteriosus to the obstructed portion of the aorta; but from its thickened appearance, it did not seem pro-. bable much communication by means of it could have been allowed, and the florid counte- nance of the boy during life establishes the same conclusion. There having been no suspicion of this singular deviation from the natural struc- ture till after the contents of the thorax were removed from the body, it was impossible to. trace, with the accuracy that could be wished, the anastomosing branches by which the circu- lation had been carried on in the inferior parts of the body ; but I think enough has been ob- J served to lead us very near the truth. The ar- ') teria innominata, the left subclavian, the supe- ^ rior intercostals, and the mammary arteries, were much enlarged. The epigastric was reported to i be of its natural size. These facts, and the i aorta acquiring at least very nearly its natural ] size immediately below the stricture, shew that \ the blood did not pass to the inferior extremities, j in any material quantity, as might perhaps have been expected, by thd inosculations of the mam- ^ mary and epigastric arteries, but chiefly by the j Circulalidti communications of the superior intercostals | by the su- and the mammary arteries with the three large \ tercS's branches entering the aorta below the stricture: : and mam- from the mammai'les and thoracics through I; manes. ^ others of the intercostal and diaphragmatic ar- | teries. . !

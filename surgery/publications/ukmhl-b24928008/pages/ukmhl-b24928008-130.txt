ON IRITIS. took a severe cold, which was followed by en- larged tonsil and sublingual glands, sore throat, and a fresh inflammation of the right eye; a rising also appeared upon the tibia of the right leg, a S little below the tubercle, which was painful, but the skin not discoloured. ' She applied to me a fortnight after tins time, i|j for an advanced inflammation of the interior tunics of the eye. The pupil was contracted, irregular, and a very large mass of brown 1 lymph covered the semi-diameter of the iris | next the temple, projecting so as to occupy I more than one third of the aqueous chamber. ; The cornea and humors were hazy. The ; sclerotic conjunctiva had a leaden colour, and the eye-ball appeared to have lost its spheroidal shape, as if from interstitial absorption of the vitreous humor. She sulfered severe hemicra- nia on the same side; her strength was greatly impaired, and with the affected eye she had scarcely any vision. I took her into the hospi- tal, and after freely bleeding the temple and eyelids by cupping and leeches, prescribed the calomel and opium pill;â€”it disagreed with her , bowels; the sublimate was given in frequent *' doses; and the extr. hyoscyami night and morn- ing. The mouth soon became slightly sore, and the inflammation gradually subsided. The lymph was rapidly absorbed, the sight daily became ; clearer under the use of the belladonna. The | swelling on the tibia had now become larger 1 and acutely painful, and as it had evidently i suppurated, I directed it to be laid open, which i operation was followed by an attack of hys- | teria.

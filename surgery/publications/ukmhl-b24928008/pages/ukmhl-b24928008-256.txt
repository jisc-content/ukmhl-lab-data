216 ON EXOSTOSIS. some osseous spicula, and I was able readily to break it down with my finger. On the following day the patient had a con- sidejable degree of fever, which continued to increase until the fourth day, when he became comatose, and on the sixth day he died. Upon examination of the body, I found that the swell- ing occupied the internal as well as the external table ot the cranium it extended through both, and affected the dura mater which had several fungous projections proceeding from it; and that the inflammation which had been excited by the operation, had extended to the membranes of the brain opposite to the part where the disease had been seated. This complaint seems to have orisrinated in the diploQ of the os frontis, and to have pro- duced an effusion both between the pericra- nium and the skull, and between the skull and the dura mater. The swelling upon the outer part of the head, was, however, much larger than that which had arisen from the inner table. It was evident, too, that this ease must ulti- mately, and at no distant period, have proved fatal, if no operation had been performed. An exostosis on the external table of the skull, growing slowly, very little vascular, unat- tended with any considerable pain, may safely be rendered the subject of an operation ; but a swelling of more rapid growth, red upon its sur- face, shewing signs of considerable vascularity, and attended with great pain shooting through the brain, is one for which I should now hesi- tate to perform an operation.

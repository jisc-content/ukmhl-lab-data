Feb. 8, 1816.—Alfred Wright, aged 18, of a scrophulous habit, had a gonorrhoea four months since, for which he took mercury, so as to make his mouth tender. Under this treatment the penis swelled greatly, and phymosis succeeded, the prepuce sloughed to a considerable extent, so that the glans penis passed through it on the upper side. The remaining portion of the hood of the prepuce, the frenum, and the front of the glans also sloughed. The urine now- flows by an aperture in the dorsum, behind the corona glandis, where is situated a deep, irrita- ble, and ill defined ulcer, disposed to spread. Ordered : H. aper. p. r. n.: Antim. tartar, gr. opii gr. i. f. pil. om. noc. sum.; Decoct, cinchon : cerevisiae fort. lb. i. per diem.

As the health slowly but progressively im- proved, the sores healed. Discharged in May following.

II 246 ON WOUNDS AND into the upper extremity of the femoral vein, the air passed by it through the wound exter- nally. The same was attempted to be done with the femoral artery, but it did' not appear to have any communication with the external W'ound. The vein was next laid open; its inter- nal tunic was covered with adhesive matter, and the sides at the lower part were adhering. It contained nothing like recent blood. All the coats were much thickened, and its capacity was gradually diminished downwards to the wound, â€¢ where it was completely closed. There was an opening in the coats of the vein about three quar- ters of an inch above the obliterated part, and this | opening communicated with the external wound. Below the obliteration, the wound was in a healthy state, the coats of the vessel were na- ^ tural, and it contained a clot of blood. The adhesive inflammation had extended from the I internal surface of the femoral vein to the iliac, as high as the bifurcation of the cava. The cava was also inflamed, but here the inflammation ' had not produced lymph or pus. The internal | surface of the iliac vein presented the same , appearance as the femoral; the corresponding i i iliac on the opposite side was not affected. The artery was next examined ; its internal sur- face was healthy, the lymph plug extended to some considerable distance above the situation of the ligature, and its extremity was contracted and closed. There was considerable serous eflfli- sion in tlie chest, one of the lobes of tlie left lung was covered with a recent deposit of lymph, and the parenchymatous substance of the lungs

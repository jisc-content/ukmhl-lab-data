ON WOUNDS AND 230 diet; on the 18th was convalescent, and dis- charged. 24th, re-admitted; the ophthalmia having returned with increased violence, was cupped on the temples ; after the operation he complained to me of pain in the right arm, and said that the wound made in the vein on the ISth, had never closed; that soon after the bleeding, the bandage becoming loose, he ap- plied some adhesive plaster; this had also soon rubbed off, and for some days the orifice made by the lancet had been unprotected. He had from the 16th felt pain, which now becoming severe, he was induced to mention it. Upon examination there was a small open wound, with everted edges, and a slight discharge of pus; the pain extended up the arm in the course of the vein, and he had a quick pulse. A poultice was applied to the part, a fomenta- tion to the arm, and he was purged and placed on tea diet. 25th, more pain, vein appears enlarged, much redness and tension of the arm; wound as yesterday.

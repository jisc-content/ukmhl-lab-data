That in this enlightened country, men without educa- tion should be with impunity suffered to de- grade a most useful profession, and put to the tor- ture those who have the folly to apply to them, is a disgrace to our laws, and calls loudly for prevention. Dislocations of the elbow-joint in children are said to be of frequent occurrence. Surgeons say, “ I have a child under my care with luxa- tion of its elbow, and I can easily return the bone into its place, but it directly dislocates again.” Such a case is an oblique fracture of the condyles of the os humeri, which produces the appearance of dislocation, by allowing the radius and ulna, or the ulna alone, to be drawn back with the fractured condyle, so as to pro- duce a considerable projection at the posterior part of the joint. The impediments to the reduction of disloca- Reduction* tion are often imputed to causes which do not exist. In some joints the form of the bone gives rise to difficulty, but in a much less degree than is generally supposed. When the socket is surrounded by a lip of bone, as in the hip-joint, the head of the bone in its reduction stops at this projection, and it requires to be lift- ed over it: and when the head ©f a bone is much larger than its cervix, a difficulty arises from Difficulty this cause, as for example, in the dislocation of c

It was the opinion of an eminent surgeon that these sores, which were thoroughly, intractable, would not heal until the prepuce was freely .divided, and impressed with the same idea, after poulticing for some days, I slit it up. The sores immediately healed, but the wound as quickly assumed the same indolent and in- tractable character which had belonged to the sores, and was so slow in healing, that it seemed to be only a transfer of the disease from one part to another. In a case of extreme enlargement, where the retention was urgent and livid discoloration marking the approach of gangrene had begun, I slit up the prepuce ; but although consider- able relief was afforded, the recovery of the part was very slowly effected. * The reader will find some judicious observations on this subject in the Surgical Works of Desault, by Bichat. ,Art.

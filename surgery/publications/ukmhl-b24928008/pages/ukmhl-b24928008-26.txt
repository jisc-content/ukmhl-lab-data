They often dissect the muscles of a limb with great neatness and minuteness, and then throw it away, without any examination of the liga- ments, a knowledge of which, in a surgical point of view, is of infinitely greater impor- tance ; and from hence arise the errors of which they are guilt;^, wffien they embark in the prac- tice of their profession ; for the injuries of the hip, elbow, and shoulder, are scarcely to be de- tected, but by those who possess accurate ana- tomical information.

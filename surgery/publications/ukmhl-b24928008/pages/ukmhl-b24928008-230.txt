The epiglottis was bent down upon the rima glottidis, so as to pro- duce great difficulty in breathing. The tumor originated from the medullary membrane within the cancellated structure of the bone, and was composed of cartilage and bony spicula, but upon the surface consisted chiefly of a white, fibrous, elastic mass, resembling the elastic ligaments of the body. The shell of the bone was entirely absorbed: the alveolar processes were greatly elongated, and bristled with bony spicula. . The external shell had numerous large holes ( in it. The incisores teeth were directed for- wards, and the molares outwards. The foramen in the jaw, for the transmission of its large nerve, was capable of receiving the extremity of the finger, so greatly was it en- larged.

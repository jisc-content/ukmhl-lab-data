LIGATURE! OF VEINS. 257 presented a round solid cord of little more than the size of the artery, and of a cartila- ginous hardness. The pericardium and pleura of this animal were inflamed, although the vein .was sound between the point of obliteration and the chest. - . Veins have been found obliterated and con- oblitera- tion of verted into ligament-like cords, in dissections of veins, dead bodies, when no sign of a contiguous mor- bid action presented itself* j and not unfre- quently their canals have been interrupted and their coats removed by the pressure of adjacent tumors obstructing the circulation t. It is of course impossible to ascertain whether inflam- mation had taken place upon the interior of the vein in these cases. I have lately seen an instance of obliterated '> ^ tion and internal jugular vein, by the pressure of a tumor ulceration situated deeply on the right side of the trachea communi- and covering the great vessels. The patient afaifscisa!' who was attended and examined after death by Mr. Kingdon, Surgeon, of Finsbury Place, had of late discharged pus and blood, both by the mouth and by the rectum. The tumor was found upon dissection to con- tain dead cellular substance, and a quantity of blood in a state of putrefaction. The internal Ljugular vein was filled for some space by a coa- ; gulum of blood, but an ulcerated orifice of com- * Haller, Opusc. Pathol. Obs. xx. Morgagni, Lett. 56. â€¢Art. 10; Bartolin.

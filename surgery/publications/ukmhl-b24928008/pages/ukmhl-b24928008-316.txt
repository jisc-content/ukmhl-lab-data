ON WOUNDS AND ♦ Jones on Hsemorrhage, chap. II. sec. 3. the direct an^ indirect consequences of wounds, inflicted upon these distinct orders of blood- vessels. The longitudinal wound of an artery, from which blood has just escaped in quantity, is found with “ its edges in perfect contact.” A crescentic wound is in twenty-four hours united by an intervening portion of lymph, which “ not only adheres to its edges, but seems to have been effused from them.” In forty hours a transverse wound of one third of the cylinder is “ distinctly seen plugged up with lymph, which adheres all round to its edges, and projects a little within the canal of the vessel.” In a more extensive transverse wound of the jugular vein, examined at seventy hours, I found no appearance whatever, but a plug of coagulated blood filling the wound, but not projecting within the canal of the vein. At five days—within the canal of the artery there was a very considerable and extensive effu- sion of lymph.” At eight days—“ on each side of the wounded part, and to some extent above and below, there was a very considerable effusion of lymph which adhered to its edges.” At nine days—“ the wound was seen to be completely cicatrized j” and the same abundant effusion of lymph was observed in the vicinity of arte- rial wounds, from which, oA^ing to their extent and direction,'the haemorrhage had within a few days proved fatal

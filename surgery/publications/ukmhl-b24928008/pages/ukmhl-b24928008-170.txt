CASE OF LIGATURE 130 In danger of another haemor- rhage, which would prove fatal. Small open- ing nia le into the aneurism. Finger in- troduced. At 9 o’clock the same evening I saw him, and found him in so reduced a state, that he could not survive another haemorrhage, with which he was every moment threatened. Yet, still anxious to avoid opening the abdomen, to secure the aorta near to its bifurcation, I determined to ascertain whether it was practicable to pass a ligature around the artery from within the aneurismal sac ; for I was of opinion, that if the artery had given way near the centre of the sac, as it usually does in aneurism, I might compress it with my finger, and pass a thread around it. With this view, I made a small incision upon the aneurism, about two inches above Poupart’s ligament; and having made a very small open- ing into the sac, I passed my finger easily into it, and felt for the artery upon which it was formed ; in doing which, my finger so complete- ly filled the opening, that it prevented the es- cape of any blood by its side. I moved the fin- ger to feel for the artery, but found only a chaos of broken coagula, and that the artery entered the sac above and quitted it below, without there being any intervening portion of vessel; and therefore, was constrained to abandon that mode of operation. When I was about to with- draw my finger, I directed two of the students to compress with their hands the aorta upon the spine, and they succeeded in stopping the pul- sation in the artery of the right groin. As I withdrew my finger, I put a dossil of lint by its side, and closed the opening which I had made into the sac. It is proper here to observe, that the aperture

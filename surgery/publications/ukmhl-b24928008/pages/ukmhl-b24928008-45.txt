21 ON DISLOCATIONS. Force gra- dual. culties. that force should be only gradually applied. Violence is as likely to tear sound parts as to reduce those which are luxated j it calls up all the powers of resistance to oppose the efforts making by the surgeon. But it is his duty to produce gradually that state of fatigue and re- laxation which is sure to follow continued ex- tension, and not to attempt at once to over- power the action of the muscles. When a dislocation has long happened, diffi- other dim culties arise from three other circumstances: the extremity of the bone contracts adhesion to the surrounding parts, so that even when in dis- section the muscles are removed, the bone can- not be reduced. In this state I found the head of a radius, which had been long dislocated upon the external condyle of the os humeri, and which is preserved in the Collection at Saint Thomasâ€™s Hospital, and in a similar state I have seen the os humeri when dislocated. The socket is also sometimes filled with adhesive matter, that if the bone was reduced it could not remain in its ori- ginal situation. Lastly, a new bony socket is sometimes formed in which the head oCthe bone is so completely confined, that nothing but its fracture could allow it to escape from its new situation. (See Plate 2.) The means employed for the reduction of Means of dislocations are either constitutional or me- chanical ; it is generally wrong to employ force only, as it becomes necessary to use it in such a degree as to occasion violence and injury, and it will in the sequel be shewn that the most powerful mechanical means fail when unaided reduction.

285 LIGATURES OF VEINS. left by the irregular deposition of adhesive mat- ter, which here and there amounts to a quan- tity sufficient to obstruct the canal. But, al- though the formation of abscess is depending upon the circumstance which I have stated, the suppurative inflammation is mixed with the ad- hesive, as we have shewn, in numerous in- stances; to use Mr. Hunter’s words, “ mixed as if formed with itf the two modes of action “ going hand in handf another and insuper- able impediment to union. The cases given by DnT^vers, Mr. Broughton, and Mr. Oldknow, p. are examples of suppuration in which the vein had not ulcerated so as to form an ab- scess. The cases of White and Crute are ex- amples of the second termination. In these cases, the inflammation produces a continuous and excessive deposition of lymph, which ex- tends to the trunks of the system, and sometimes reaches the heart. There is a marked differ- corre- ence in the symptoms accompanying these diflerence states: the first is a protracted irritation, pro- ducing hectic, and ending in exhaustion : the second is a typhoid fever, such as we often see accompanying the severer forms of local injury, and which speedily producing delirium, termi- nates within a few days. This is a difference, not, as I believe, characterising the mode or -stage of the inflammation, but arising out of its .-situation, extent and communication with the ssurface or otherwise; where the vein of a limb ssuppurates and communicates with the surface, ithe constitutional disorder is of course less ur- igent than^^ere it occupies uninterruptedly the

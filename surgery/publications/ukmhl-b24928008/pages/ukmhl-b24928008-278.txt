ON WOUNDS AND 234 rolls fluid with flakes of lymph floating in it, was contained in the cavities of the thorax ; the lungs adhered to the pleura costalis, partially on the left side, but more extensively on the right; the structure of the brain was natural, but more serum than is usual was found in the ventricles; the veins of the pia mater were tur- gid with blood ; the vena inagna Galeni, and the sinuses were remarkably loaded.” Persons labouring under inflammatory dis- eases are subject to inflammation of the wound after bleeding. Two examples of this fact have occurred since this paper was published. The one a case of acute inflammation of the chest which proved fatal; the other of inflamed in- testine in a strangulated hernia. CASE. Henry Pennock, aged 22 years, was admitted into Guy’s Hospital, on the 4th of March, for an ulcer of the leg. During the healing of the sore, he was attacked with symptoms of pneu- monia ; a vein was opened in each arm, and the wound bound up as usual. From an incautious use of the right arm, a hemorrhage ensued on the third day after the venesection; he com- plained of pain in that arm, the orifice was in- flamed, and the vein felt cord-like from the in- duration of the surrounding cellular membrane. Pressure in the course of the vein occasioned a discharge of pus at the orifice; a fomentation and poultice was applied, and the inflammation uad nearly subsided, when an aggravation of the inflammatory disease of the chest proved rapidly fatal on the fifth day from the venesection.

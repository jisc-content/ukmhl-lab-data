ON IRITIS. 10 'Perplexity of the sub- ject arising from the use of mer- cury. Origin of iritis from mercury; progress of disease, or in other words, the course of the disease, defies the relations of texture, and is referrible to some other cause. There is little anatomical resemblance between tbe skin, periosteum and choroid, and at all events we may conclude, that the course of a morbid poison is not restricted by relations of texture. It appears then, that the difficulty of deci- ding the question, whether the iris is inflamed by the poison of syphilis, arises, not from any theoretical objection, but from the complication of the cases which are presented to us, by the employment of another powerful agent on the constitution ; and that, until we see the course of the syphilitic poison, genuine and unsophisti- cated, we shall be unable to determine the point. This, in truth, is the cause of the obscurity that overhangs the whole subject of the venereal dis- ease. It is perhaps impossible to say to which, of two agents, the effects belong, which manifest themselves at a period, subsequent to their suc- cessive introduction, as we presume, into the system. Both, we are taught to believe, cannot be at the same time active; but both may be present, or one only may in fact have entered the system. When mercury is exhibited, as it almost constantly is, before the constitutional signs of lues appear, what demonstration can be had of the existence of syphilis in a secondary form ? or, on the other hand, who in his own case would, a priori, abandon the operation of mer- cury, in confidence that thre symptoms which are occasionally referred to its operation, are wholly independent of the poison of syphilis ? In considering whether mercury acting as a

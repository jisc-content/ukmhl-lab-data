44 ON DISLOCATIONS. C-ause. 4 backwards ; and when I state that I have been an attentive observer of the practice of our hospitals for thirty years, was also for many years in the habit of daily seeing the poor of London at my house early in the morning, and have had a considerable share of private prac- tice, if such a case does ever occur, it must be extremely rare. I cannot help thinking also, that some anatomical error must have given rise to this opinion, as in the dislocation downwards and backwards it is described as being received still into the ischiatic notch ; but this notch is, in the natural position of the pelvis, above the level of the line, drawn through the middle of the acetabulum ; and hence it is that the leg is shorter, not longer, when the bone is dislocated into the ischiatic notch. Of the Dislocation of the Fuhis. This"^ dislocation is more easy of detection than any other of the thigh. It happens from a person in walking putting his foot into some unexpected hollow in the ground, and his body at the moment is bent backwards ; the head of the bone is thrown forwards upon the os pubis. A gentleman who had met with this dislocation in his own person, told me that it happened whilst he was walking across a paved yard in the dark, and he did not know that one of the stones had been taken up : his foot suddenly sunk into the hollow, and he fell backwards; and when his limb was examined, the head of the thigh-bone was found upon the os pubis. 6

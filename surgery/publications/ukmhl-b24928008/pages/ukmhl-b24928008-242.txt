ON EXOSTOSIS, 202 Skin some- times ulcerated. Most fre- quentl}â€™ oc- curs on the os femoris. Sometimes on the tibia. in particular positions, at other times they glide suddenly over them, attended by a snapping noise which can be distinctly heard by the by- standers, and occasioning by these means painlul and unpleasant sensations. Others again pro- duce considerable pain in the limbs when the tumor advances to the surface of tlie skin. I have seen instances of its being ulcerated from this circumstance, but the sore exhibited no signs of malignancy, as will be seen in a case which I shall presently relate, in which the ulcer formed on the surlace of the skin had not an unhealthy character. We have also a prepa- ration of exostosis upon the radius, in winch the diseased growth is exposed by common ulceration. The most frequent seat of the periosteal ex- ostosis is upon the inner side of the os femoris just above the internal condyle, and in the dir rection of the insertion ot the triceps muscles. In this situation I have seen several instances of it. (See Plate.) 1 have also seen it seated on the tibia, immediately under the insertion of the sartorius and gracilis muscles. A considerable enlargement of the bone is occasionally pro- duced upon the fibula, at its connection with the tibia; it seldom however in that situation rises into any thing like a circumscribed exostosis. After long continued courses of jnercury, when the patient has been debilitated to an extreme degree, if he exert himself much in walking, not only is this thickening of the bone of the fibula produced, but a suppuratif^e process is in- stituted, which is followed by exfoliation, and

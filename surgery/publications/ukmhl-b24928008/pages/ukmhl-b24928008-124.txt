86 ON IRITIS. Its opposite effects, how reconciled. Cupping the temples is a mode of blood-letting in this disease which I have long preferred from observation of its effects, to the opening and ul- timate division of the temporal artery. The invariable consequence of dividing a pulsating artery being to increase the impulse of the cir- culation in the collaterals, is certainly a reason why this mode of drawing blood should be fol- lowed by a less permanent benefit. My very in- telligent friend Mr. George Young stated to me that he had several times observed arteriotomy to be followed by an aggravation of the ophthal- mia, and he ottered this argument in explanation of the fact. To those w'ho have observed the unquestion- able tendency of patients to this disease during and subsequent to the use of mercury, its double character of bane and antidote must appear a pa- radox; but considering the opposite conditions, both of the system and the part, in health and in disease, I think the seeming contradiction ceases. I see no difficulty in understanding how the sound iris should become inflamed and its vessels throw out lymphâ€”and on the other hand, the vessels of the inflamed iris recover their healthy action, and the lymph become absorbed, under the operation of the same agent. A sound part presents at least as marked a dis- tinction to a part diseased, as the opposite states of diseased parts present to each other. Yet we see deposition and absorption going on at one and the same time in different parts of the same system, healthfully if according to their respective need; the reverse, if otherwise; even sound parts, not to speak of morbid deposi-

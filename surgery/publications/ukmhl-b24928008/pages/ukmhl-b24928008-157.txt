This state of contraction in the aorta impeded the> passage of the blood through the heart and lungs, and under the extreme degree of distention thus produced, the right ventricle, from its less power of resistance, gave way, and occasioned the sud- den termination of the patient’s existence. The following case has been published in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, by Mr. Gra- ham, Physician to the Infirmary, Glasgow.— (Vide Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol.V.) “ The case which I take the liberty of trans- mitting to the Medical and Chirurgical Society, has, as far as I know, but one parallel on re- cord ; and in it the appearances on dissection only are mentioned ; no history is given of the case. I believe, I have extracted from the books of the infirmary, such parts of the reports taken at the patient’s bed-side as are of any im- portance, and have noted some anomalous symptoms which may now appear trifling; be- cause it may perhaps be found that an improved state of‘ knowledge may give importance to what at present seems adventitious, and without va- lue.

ON EXOSTOSIS. 200 Cartilagi- nous exos- tosis of the periosteum. Admits of ^ cure from surgery. Arises from inflamma- tion. Appear- ances on dissection. Of the cartilaginous Exostosis between the Pert- osteum and the Bone. This is a very different affection to the pre- ceding, and more deserving the attention of the surgeon, since it admits of relief by operation, though sometimes with the loss of the affected limb. It originates in the inflammation of the periosteum and of the corresponding part of the bone; and a deposition of cartilage, of very firm texture, and similar to that which forms the nidus of bone in the young subject, adheres to both these surfaces. The periosteum adheres to the external surface of the swelling, and the swelling itself is attached still more strongly to the surface of the bone. AVithin this cartilage a bony matter is deposited, which is first thrown out from the original bone; it continues afterwards to be secreted as the cartilage increases in bulk; for it appears that between the periosteum and bony mass, cartilage is constantly secreted, which constitutes the exterior surface of this tumor. Thus, on dissection, we discover, 1st, The perios- teum thicker than natural; 2nd, the cartilage immediately below the periosteum; and, 3d, ossific matter deposited within the cartilage, extending from the shell of the bone nearly to the internal surface of the periosteum, still leav- ing on the surface of the swelling a thin por- tion of cartilage unossified. When the accretion of these swellings ceases, and the disease has been of long standing, they are found to consist, on their exterior surface, : ( (. > 1 t i

CASE OF LIGATURE 124 Aorta con- tract od be- low the arci). Arch very slightly dilated. ning down the sides of the chest tortuous and remarkably enlarged. It was natural for him to be very careful in the dissection of this subject. He found the aorta immediately beyond its arch contracted to the size of a writing quill ; the coats of the artery were of their usual thickness, and its cavity of course extremely small; the arch of the aorta above this contraction was but very slightly dilated; the part below had lost nothing of its natural size. Nothing could be found either in its own structure, or in the con- dition of the neighbouring parts, to account for this contraction of the artery. The carotids were in the natural state; the arteria innominata, and the left subclavian were enlarged to twice their natural diameter; all their smaller branches were increased in the same proportion, and had assumed a curled and zigzag course: the internal mammary and phrenic arteries w-ere greatly enlarged and very tortuous. The transverse arteries of the neck were of twice their natural si?e ; the posterior branches were tortuous, extending to a great distance over the back, with long inosculations which wei'e met from below by the branches of the upper intercostal arteries, and they were also remarkably enlarged ; the thoracic and sca- pular arteries which run along the side of the chest, were twice their natural size. Below the constricted part of the aorta, the lower intercostals were remarkably enlarged even to three or four times their natural size; each of them was dilated, but those were most affected which were given off nearest the con- tracted part; and the posterior branch of each

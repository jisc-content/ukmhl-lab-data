We have also an example of this disease growing upon the surface of the head of the tibia, and which I believe to have been of the fungous kind. I have lately seen one arising from the fore part of this bone just above the ancle joint, with the flection of which it begins to interfere. A man was admitted into Guy's Hospital under the care of Mr. Forster with a large tumor seated upon the upper part of the tibia, which felt soft, and yielded to the finger, so as to give the impression of its being a fungous disease. Mr. Forster directed adhe- sive plasters to be applied, by the pressure of which the size of the swelling was so much reduced, that the patient quitted the hospi- tal, satisfied that a continuance of the means which he had applied would suffice to accom- plish a cure. In a few weeks he returned with the swelling greatly increased, when he was admitted under the care of Mr. Lucas, who made an incision into the swelling, and dis- charged several hydatids, which were of the common globular kind.

An incision being made into the tumor after the removal of the limb, a large nest in the bone was found, con- taining numerous hydatids. Upon boiling the section opposite the bony nest, a fracture was found in the tibia, which had probably been produced by the disease, as the patient did N

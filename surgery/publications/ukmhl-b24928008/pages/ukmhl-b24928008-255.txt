Its fixed state, and the firmness it presented to the touch, convinced me that it was exostosis; yet at the same time it was less resisting and more vascular than the cartilaginous exostosis usually is. I re- lated to the patient the case above given, stated to him its favourable result, and ad- vised him to become a patient in the hospi- tal, where he might undergo a similar opera- tion ; as, without it, I conceived that the disease must necessarily prove fatal. To my advice he readily assented, and submitted to the operation 1 had recommended to him a few days after his admission into the hospital. I began by making an incision through the integuments directly over the tu- mor, from the surface of which there issued a very considerable quantity of blood. I conti- nued to turn aside the integuments until I reached the surface of the cranium, and then with a metacarpal saw, succeeded in cutting through a substance much softer than common cartilage, containing numerous but slender spicula of bone within it.

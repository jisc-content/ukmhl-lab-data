The upper part of the fibula, near the head of the bone, is sometimes enlarged, and its lower end very frequently so, where it is connected by a ligament to the tibia. This enlargement, however, arises perhaps more frequently from common adhesive inflammation in the bone than from true exostosis. The metatarsal bones are now and then the seat of exostosis. I have known half the foot obliged to be amputated for this disease, placed at the extremities of those bones towards the toes. Two instances of exostosis under the nail of the great toe, projecting considerably beyond it, have occurred in my practice j one of which occasioned so much pain and inconvenience to the lady who was the subject of it, that I was under the necessity of removing it; which 1 easily accomplished with a saw.

His li- gamentum nuchae was ossified, and prevented the motion of his neck ; the margins of the axilla were also ossified, so that he was as it were completely pinioned ; besides all this, the sub- ject in question had numerous other exostoses in various parts of the body. 6

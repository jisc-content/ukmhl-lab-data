ON DISLOCATIONS. 38 Dissection. We have an excellent preparation of this ac- cident in the collection at St. Thomasâ€™s Hospi- tal, which I dissected many years ago. The head of the thigh-bone was found resting in the foramen ovale, but the obturator externus muscle was completely absorbed, and the liga- ment naturally occupying the foramen, was en- tirely converted into bone. Around the foramen ovale bony matter was deposited, so as to form | a deep cup, in which the head of the thigh-bone was inclosed, but in such a manner as to allow of considerable motion ; and the cup thus form- ed surrounded the neck of the thigh-bone with- out touching it, so as to inclose the head, that it could not be removed from its new socket without breaking its edges. The inner side of this new cup was extremely smooth, having not the least ossific projection at any part of it to im- ^ pede the motion of the head of the bone, which i was only restrained by the muscles from its usual i movements. The original acetabulum was half f filled by bone, so that it could not have re- ceived the ball of the thigh-bone if it had been | put back into its natural situation. The head j of the thigh-bone was very little altered j its ar- 1 ticular cartilage still remained ; the ligamentum teres was entirely broken, and the capsular liga- > ment partially torn through; the pectinalis I muscle and adductor brevis had been lacerated, ' i but were united by tendon ; the psoas muscle j and iliacus internus, the glutei and pyriformis \ were all upon the stretch. Nothing can be more I curious, or to the surgeon and physiologist more ^ beautiful, than the changes produced by this %

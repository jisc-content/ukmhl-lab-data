183 ON EXOSTOSIS. With respect to the cause of the fungous me- dullary exostosis, nothing certain is known. In some instances it has been attributed to a blow; in others to a jump from a very considerable height. Either of these causes, by disturbing the interior action of the bone, might produce the elfect. In the lower jaw I have seen this disease arise from a decayed tooth. But when the exos- tosis proves of the fungous kind, it implies an unhealthy state of the constitution, giving rise to the unusual action which follows the injury. In the treatment of this complaint, we have not only to combat the local disease, but like- wise to effect a change in the constitution in which it occurs. When it has however produced any great changes of structure, or occasioned very considerable increase of parts, no medical means will suffice to restore them, or prevent the fatal tendency of the complaint. But in the commencement of any deep-seated disease in bone, the best medicine, so far as I have had opportunity of observing, is the oxymurias hy- drargyri in small doses, given either in, or with, the decoct, sarsaparillas compositum. This mer- curial medicine, by reproducing the natural se- cretions of the body, and the sarsaparilla, by lessening its irritability, restore the general health, and will sometimes crush in its bud a disease, otherwise likely to become formidable, and at the same time prevent the formation of a similar affection in other structures. The local treatment consists in the applica- tion of leeches, if there be pain, and of blisters, Cause. Treatment in general.

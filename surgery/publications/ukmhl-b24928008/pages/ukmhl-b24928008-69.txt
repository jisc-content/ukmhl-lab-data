45 ON DISLOCATIONS. The limb is in this case an inch shorter than symptoms, the other; the knee and the-foot are turned outwards, and cannot be rotated inwards, but there is a slight flexion forwards and outwards ; and in a dislocation which had been long unre- duced, the motion at the knee backwards and forwards was full twelve inches; but the striking criterion of this dislocation is, that the head of the thigh-bone may be distinctly felt upon the pubis, above the level of Poupart’s ligament, to the outer side of the femoral artery and vein. It feels as a hard ball there, which is readily perceived to move by bending the thigh-bone. Yet although this case is apparently so easy of detection, I have known three instances, in which it was overlooked, until it was too late for re- duction. One, of which we have now a prepa- Not detect- ration at St. Thomas’s Hospital ; one in a gen- tleman from the country, in whom it was not discovered until some weeks after the accident. He then submitted to an extension which did not succeed, and came to London to ask my opinion, when I advised him against a further extension, and, indeed, he was himself averse to any other trial. The third was a patient in Guy’s Hos- pital, who w^as admitted for an ulcerated leg, and was found to have a dislocation upon the pubis, which had happened some years be- fore. It really must be great carelessness which leads to this error, as the case is so strikingly marked. I dissected one of these dislocations, and we Dissection, have it preserved in our Anatomical Collection. It shews changes of parts nearly, but not quite

LIGATURES OF VEINS. 255 ! I \ t t t ! peculiar to the lymphatic system of the horse species, for the inflamed jugular vein seldom forms abscess, much less a string of abscesses. He has occasionally seen abscess form at the pa- rotid gland after inflammation of the vein, and this event is considered critical of the inflam- mation, and therefore favourable. Sometimes a horse,by rubbing his neck after bleeding, or being soon after put to work with too small a collar, or from sudden exertion, as in coughing, opens the vein afresh, and brings on a dangerous bleeding, so that he requires to be watched night and day. In order to bleed a second time on the same day, some practitioners inconsiderately give the vein a blow above the wound to rupture the adhesion ; and the vein thus burst open is apt to suppurate. I was shewn at the Veterinary College the vein of a horse, which had been sent in for cure, the vessel having inflamed and ulcerated after bleed ing at the place of the wound. The continuity of the vessel was destroyed by ulceration to the extent of an inch or more; its sides below the breach enormously thickened, and its cavity filled by masses ofâ€˜ coagulable lymph above, so as to have lost all appearance of a tube. It was filled with a compact and extended clot of blood towards the heart. Upon dissection,'both lymph and pus were traced in the course of the vein into the sinuses of the brain, and the mem- branes of the brain were much inflamed. Where a vein is disposed to bleed afresh, owing , to an ulceration of its coats, the most approved prac- tice is to introduce the actual cautery superfi- cially within its cavity, to produce eschar and the process of granulation.

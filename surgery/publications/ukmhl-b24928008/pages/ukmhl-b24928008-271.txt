ON WOUNDS AND LIGATURES OP VEINS. Bv Mr. TRAVERS. The inflaimnation to which the interior tunic of the veins is liable, was first distinctly pointed out by Mr. Hunter. The serious consequences arising from venesection had been supposed to proceed from other causes, previous to Mr. Hunter’s Essay on this subject, in the Medical and Chirurgical Transactions. They were as- cribed to a wound of the fibres of the cutaneous nerves, or the prick of the neighbouring ten- dons, or of the fascia upon which the veins lie, an • opinion maintained by some writers even after tthe publication of Mr. Hunter’s paper*. In- iflammation of the cellular texture, the absor- Ibents, or the fascia may occur from any wound ipenetrating those parts, and it therefore now tand then appears after venesection, as Mr. .Abernethy has shewn in his Essay on the occa- ssional ill consequences of that operation t.

Iritery/^* I wislicd to try what would be the effect of cutting off the supply of blood in these cases of fungus, by tying the artery which supplies them. My colleague, Mr. Lucas, also made a similar trial j but the result of both cases shewed that such attempts will avail but little. They are therefore here mentioned, to deter others from making them.

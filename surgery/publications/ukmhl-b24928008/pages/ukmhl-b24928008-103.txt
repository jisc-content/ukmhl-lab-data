ON IRITIS. By Mk. TRAVERS. The interior tunics of the eye are subject to inflammation, arising either as an idiopathic aflection, or from the extension of protracted inflammation of the superficial tunic. The effects of this inflammation are conspicuous in the iris, and by the term “ Iritis” I mean to ex- press the deep seated inflammation of the eye. It appears in company with rheumatism of the chronic form, sometimes witli^ gout; with the constitutional signs of the lues venerea; and during or following the action of mercury upon the system. It is in reference to the two latter associatiotls of the iritis, that I propose principally to consi- der the disease in this essay. Although the cases of iritis co-existing with sore throat, cutaneous eruptions, and nodes, which are regarded and successfully treated as venereal, are too frequen'Mo escape observation, the iris is not mmftioned by Mr. Hunter and other pathologists as d part subject to be affected by the syphilitic poison*. I have met with cases in which the mer- Combina- cunal action had been set up for primary lues, mer- and the iritis was present, unaccompanied by any secondary symptom of that disease. I have also met with cases of iritis in which pains * Mr. Hunter is not singular in questioning the existence of a venereal ophthalmia. F

256 ON WOUNDS AND Slough. Ulceration of the wound. History of a fatal case. Hon^S^' While prosecuting this inquiry, I met with hoisesâ€™veins cascs in wliicli tlic jugulai* vein had been ob- literated by inflammation after bleeding, a case with which farriers are familiar ; I was told of one in which a considerable portion of the vein had sloughed, the inflammation and abscess ha-^ ving extended in that case some way downward, toward the heart. I saw a third, in which the actual cautery was introduced near an inch with- in the vein, in consequence of repeated alarming bleedings from ulceration of the. orifice; and at a slaughter-house I examined the vein of a horse which had died from ha^motli^^^lge,. in conse- quence of ulceration of the vein at the orifice. I obtained the following short history of this case. The farrier, dissatisfied with the bleed- ing from the first wound, again struck the vein with the phlegm, and made so large a wound that an hsemorrhage followed, which was wdth great difficulty suppressed. On the third day the animal was put to work, when the vein bled afresh to a very considerable amount. The cautery was then had recourse to, but the animal continued to bleed at in- tervals, and was soon exhausted. I have re- presented the ulcerated orifice of the vein in Jig. 2. 'plate 10. Masses of coagulated blood were found in the vein above the wound, which was so extensive as nearly to dissever the vessel, but no appearance of an adhesive process pre- sented itself in the upper portion of the vein. Next the heart the vein was lined by a rough coat of lymph, and at two inches distance from the orifice was obliterated by a contraction and interstitial thickening of its coats, so that it

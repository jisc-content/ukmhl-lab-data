12 The Keport consists, mainly, of a consideration of the circum- stances which relate especially to the General Practitioners; doubtless, the profession will receive, from other parties, an exposition of the views of the different corporations. The Council of the Institute will, in this place, refer only to one other point. In a series of resolutions by some gentlemen in Gloucestershire, a copy of which is given in the Report, the powers of the Council to represent the General Practitioners are j called in question. The Council consists of Forty-eight | General Practitioners, Metropolitan and Provincial, intrusted a with the interests of the largest Voluntary Association of Medical | Practitioners ever known in this country—The National Asso- 1 elation—consisting of upwards of four thousand of their brethren 9 of the same class in the Profession. This trust was reposed in 9 them, formally and constitutionally, by the Association. The ■ Committee of the Association comprising upwards of one hundred a Members (for the most part Presidents, Vice-Presidents, or other a office bearers of the different Local Associations of General a Practitioners) have from time to time expressed their cordial ■ approval of the proceedings of the Council. The Government M satisfied itself that the Council of the Institute fully and fairly, represents this great interest. Under these circumstances, ■ however, from personal considerations, they might be inclined, • ■ the members of the Council could not shrink from the responsi-^i bility thus imposed upon them,by their Professional brethren, without laying themselves open to the charge of an unjustifiablei^B abandonment of a great public trust.

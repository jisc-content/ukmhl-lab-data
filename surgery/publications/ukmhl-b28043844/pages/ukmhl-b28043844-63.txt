61 luctance, and deep regret, that the Council of the Institute feels itself called upon to refer to this document, both on account of the objectionable matter of the petition itself, and the respec- tability of many of the gentlemen whose names must have been appended to it in error. The petition is a direct misrepresen- tation to the Legislature, of the facts of the case before the petitioners. That there may be no misunderstanding, however, upon this point, the Council place before the Members of the Institute the following;— {Copy.'l To the Bight Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in Parliament assembled. The petition of members of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, resident in the county of Essex, in public meeting at Colchester assembled, showeth,— That by the Charter last granted to the Royal College of Surgeons of England, certain of its members were created “fellows” of that college, by which injustice was done towards the great body of members, inasmuch as all became members on equal terms, passing through the same course of study, undergoing the same examination, paying the same fees, and until then enjoying the same privileges. That the establishment of any new medical corporation such as that proposed under the title of the “Royal College of General Prac- titioners” will be unjust towards the members of the Royal College of Surgeons, since by it they will be deprived of their present rights and titles, and compelled to belong to an inferior grade and rank in the profession to be by it created. That the Company of Apothecaries, being willing to relinquish its position as an examining body, the Royal College of Surgeons of England is well fitted, by the learning of its council, its long establish- ment, great wealth, and extensive library and museum, to direct the affairs of the profession generally, and that the addition of medicine, midwifery, and pharmacy, to their present examinations, with an extended and liberal administration of its affah-s, will render it efficient for the direction and protection of the interest and honour of the medical profession.

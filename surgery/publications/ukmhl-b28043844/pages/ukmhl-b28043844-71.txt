The Members of the Col- lege made a strenuous effort to obtain the abrogation of the disqualifying Laws against Midwifery and Pharmacy about the 1 commencement of the present century. They were heard by Counsel before the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General, and their claim disallowed.^* Again, in 1833, the Council professed to have an examination in Midwifery, and the Bye-laws for establishing it passed through all the regular rules and orders till they went to Sir Frederick Pollock, the standing Counsel of the College, who declared that the Court of Examiners had not tlie power to appoint Examiners in Midwifery.f Subsequently to the grant of the Charter of 1843, at the commencement of the present agitation, a Memorial, with the object of opening the College, was got up by the “Medical Protection Assembly ' which was said to he signed by 1200 Members of the College. Petitions and Memorials innumerable, of the same tenor, from all parts of the country, have been presented to the College and to the Government. All these exertions have been unattended with success. Not the slightest sympathy with those who wish, to abrogate the powers of the Apothecaries’ Society, and make the College of Surgeons the “ alma 7nater ” of the General Practitioners, has been manifested by any party of influence, or in authority; the Council of the College of Surgeons, under the existing Laws and Charters, are thus compelled to main- tain it as a College of Surgeons specially so considered, and to resist any change, the immediate or remote effect of which must be the conversion of it into a College of General Practitioners in Medicine, Surgery and Midwifery. The only resource left then for the Petitioners is—the Legis- lature. An Act of Parliament must be obtained to modify the • Minutes of Evidence, 1848—Second Report, p. 4. •)• Idem, p. 15.

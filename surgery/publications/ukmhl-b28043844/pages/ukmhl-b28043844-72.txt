70 constitution of the College of Surgeons in face of the opposition of the Council of that College and the Government; doubtless also, of the main body of the Fellows of the College of Sur- geons, of the College of Physicians, and other parties; for the effect of the change must be to render the College of Surgeons to all intents and purposes a College of Medicine. The Council of the Institute do not believe that there is the remotest chance of effecting this, and, as practical men, they strenuously advise the General Practitioners not to be led into a new and fruitless agitation for an unattainable object, nor for the sake of humbling those who have doubtless inflicted upon many individuals an act of the greatest injustice, to seek to deny themselves, their profession and the public, the advantages of ; any and every beneficial arrangement which may be placed ^ within their reach. In stating their opinions thus strongly, the Council of the -. Institute are not unmindful of the fact, that if all other objects were abandoned, and the demands of the General Practitioners * restricted to some such power as that sought for by Mr. Guthrie . j. to be given to the Council of the College of Surgeons, enabling M them to make another selection from the Members of a limited ^ number of individuals to be created Fellows, restricted probably a to those of twenty, or even twelve, years’ standing, possessing cer- 3 tain qualifications, and under certain certificates of recommenda- « tion, that by some considerable effort on the part of the great body a of the Members of the College such a demand might ultimately be conceded. The Profession will observe, that the augmentation of the Fellowship in the College of Surgeons to this extent, and ^ even further, is by no means inconsistent with the principles of M Keform as agreed upon, nor has it any bearing whatever upon 'S those Measures for the future regulation of the Profession which » all parties deem so desirable.

18 represent the opinions of above 4,000 of tlie general practitioners of England and Wales. That upon a former occasion the previous Council of the National Institute had the honour of presenting a memorial, bearing date De- cember 24th, 1846, to Her Majestyâ€™s Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, in which memorial the opinions and senti- ments of the class of medical practitioners whom your memorialists represent, were carefully and deliberately stated.

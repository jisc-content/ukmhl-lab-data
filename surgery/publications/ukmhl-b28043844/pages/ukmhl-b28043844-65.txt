63 the College of Surgeons will be entitled to liold office in any public institution as a Surgeon—every Member of the College of ■ Surgeons will retain all the rights he now enjoys as a Member of that College, even the right of becoming a Fellow, and the ■right of continuing to seek redress of the grievances inflicted upon him by the Charter of 1843; and in addition to all this, ’every Member of the College of Surgeons will acquire the right of belonging to the new Eoyal College, embracing Medicine and Midwifery, which College will be founded upon the most liberal representative basis. Thus it is proved, most unequivocally, that no Member of the College of Surgeons will be deprived of any right or title which he now possesses, by the establishment of the proposed Koyal College. The oft repeated statement, that the new College must neces- sarily be an inferior Institution, is dealt with in another part of this Keport; but as respects the vague assertion, also comprised in the paragi-aph adverted to, viz., “ That the Members of the lew College must be of an inferior grade and rank in the Profession,” the Council will here only observe, that inasmuch -IS the new College will be mainly constituted in the first ^stance, and wholly in future, of Members of the College of iurgeons, if the assertion of the gentlemen of Essex mean '.nything, it is this: “ we ourselves, without any corporate ights and privileges, are of an inferior rank and grade in the Profession,—vested with corporate rights and privileges, in a Oollegiate Institution, we shall remain an inferior grade and link. For it will be observed, that the Petitioners have averred, 1 the first paragraph, that virtually, by the Charter of 1843, le Members of the College of Surgeons, not being Fellows, ■ave been constituted an inferior grade, or rather, it might be lid, the injustice thus inflicted has deprived them of all rank hatever, and has degraded them to the lowest possible degree.

77 On the other hand, the Council have had to contend with parties holding an opinion directly the converse, viz., that the proposed College must necessarily he co-ordinate in rank with the existing Institutions ; and this, in truth, has constituted one of their chief difficulties, since they have had to appease the fears of those who infer from this, that a College of General Practitioners would in a short time supersede the functions and rise superior to the elder Institutions. It may he useful to show on which side the weight of authority lies upon this prevision. The gentlemen who quote Mr. Guthrie, and adopt his views, will doubtless admit him to he of the highest authority, and the following is a record of his opinion respecting the inferiority of a College of General Practitioners :— Extract from the Minutes of Evidence tahen before the Select Committee of the House of Commons, on Medical Regis- tration, dec., March %rd, 1848, interrogatories being on the subject of the proposed ‘‘Royal College of Getteral Practitioners of England" as to its rank, equality and influettce, dec. G. R. Guthrie, Esq., examined. Do not you consider that their being connected with a College of a lower grade would he likely to lessen them in the public estimation ? They do not propose that it shall be of a lower grade, hut an equal grade. Is it not proposed in the Document to which I have referred, that the College shall be called “ The College of General Practitioners,” and not the College of Surgeons ? In the first place I do not profess to know what a General Practitioner is myself, but it does not folloiv that they should be a College of a lower grade.

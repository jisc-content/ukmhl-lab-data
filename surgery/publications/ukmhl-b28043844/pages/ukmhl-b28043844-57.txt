question, whether the proposed measures ought to he accepted or rejected. The Council of the National Institute arrived at the conclusion that they ought to be promptly, cordially, and unanimously accepted—for the following reasons:— First.—Because they comprise many of the most essential of those reforms which the General Practitioners have for years past so loudly and so repeatedly demanded: as, 1. Corporate rights and privileges, secured to the General Practitioners by the establishment of a Eepresentative Collegiate Institution; %. A uniform, high standard of education and qualification, which, after the Bill becomes law, will he secured on the part of every individual who in future enters into practice as a General Practitioner; 3. Reciprocity of practice founded on uniformity of educa- tion, similarity of the standard of qualification, and the examination tests being rendered equally stringent in the three kingdoms; 4. The registration of all legally qualified Practitioners and the periodical publication, under the authority of Government, of such registry, by which the public will be enabled to distinguish between legally quali- fied members of the Profession on the one hand, and charlatans and pretenders on the other hand; 5. That every member of the profession should be brought under the operation of a code of hye-laws, which he must observe, or render himself liable, as in the case of Attorneys, to he struck ofF the register, by which, it may he fairly antici- pated, that the Profession will be relieved of the odium attaching to disreputable members appearing in its ranks ; G. The enactment of more efiectual penalties against the practice of the Profession by individuals whose names do not appear in the register.

In about a fortnight her bowels were in a comfortable state, and in about three weeks the urine was clear, and secreted in the usual quan- tity. On the eighth day, when the dyspectic symptoms were severe, the patient had gout in her finger and toe, to which she had been previously subject. It is right to mention, that prior to the operation, the urinary secretion had never appeared to her to be irregular either in quantity or quality, and that her bowels had been readily affected by rather slight doses of medicine. - The same circumstances were observed after the subsidence of the disorder occasioned by the operation.

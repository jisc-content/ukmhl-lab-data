13 OF TUMOURS. still left, and this disease be not altered by the stimulus of the operation, no benefit is obtained: these parts again produce a dis- eased substance, which lias generally the ap- pearance of fungus, and, in consequence of being irritated by the injury of the operation, the disease is in general increased by the means which were designed for its cure. It appears, therefore, that in some cases of tu- mours, the newly-formed part alonerequires removal, whilst in others the surrounding substance must be taken away, or a radical cure cannot be effected. There is yet another circumstance de- serving attention, before I proceed to the particular consideration of the subject; which is, that a tumour once formed, seems to be a sufficient cause of its own continu- ance and increase. The irritation which it causes in the contiguous parts, is likely to keep up that increased action of vessels which is necessary to its supply; and the larger it becomes, the more does it sti- mulate, and of course contribute to its own increase.

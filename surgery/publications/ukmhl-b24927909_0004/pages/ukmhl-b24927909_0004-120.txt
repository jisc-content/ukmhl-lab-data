211 A CLASSIFICATION some cases, as a palliation of these diseases. It is not, however, meant to recommend such practice; lor, on the contrary, it will be shown hereafter, that it is dangerous to tamper with encysted tumours; and, indeed, I should not have ventured on this palliative mode of treatment, in the case related, had I not known from the effects of the former conduct, which had been pursued, that the cyst and contiguous parts were of an indolent nature, and not disposed to re-act in conse- quence of violence done to them. The contents of encysted tumours have been denominated from their consistence steatomatous, atheromatous, and meliceri- tous. To this ancient distinction must be added another; the cyst sometimes secretes a substance like nail or horn; which is pro- truded when the skill ulcerates, hardens, and is pushed forwards in proportion as the cyst secretes more of this substance, so as to appear like horns; as has been shown by Sir E. Home in the Philosophical Trans- actions.

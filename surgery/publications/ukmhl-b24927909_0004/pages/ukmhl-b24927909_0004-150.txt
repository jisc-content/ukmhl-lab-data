Lumbar abscesses, also, in general are not simple diseases; they arise from and com- municate with carious vertebrae ; which cir- cumstance is, I believe, the cause of their frequent fatality. The first eight cases that I attended, after I had adopted a new mode of opening them, were simple ab- scesses, and not arising from disease of the bone ; which led me to believe, that they were more frequently unconnected with diseased bone than later experience has taught me. The general opinion of sur- geons, in which I entirely concur, is, that lumbar abscesses most frequently arise in consequence of diseases of the vertebrae, and they should certainly all be treated as if such was the origin. Before I proceed to describe the particu- lar treatment which I would recommend in chronic and lumbar abscesses, it will be use- ful to enquire into the cause of that consti- tutional disorder which is so generally con- sequent to their becoming open. It has been ascribed to the admission of air into the cavity of the abscess, or to the absorption of

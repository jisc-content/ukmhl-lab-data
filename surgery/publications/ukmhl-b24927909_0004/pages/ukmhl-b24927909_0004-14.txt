Many enlargements of glands are, however, includ- ed in the definition, as they are found to be owing to a tumour growing in them, and either condensing the natural structure, or causing the absorption of the original gland. Sometimes also the disease of the gland seems to produce an entire alteration of structure in the part; the natural organization being removed, and a new-formed diseased struc- ture substituted in its stead. In either of these cases the disease of the gland is designed to be included in the definition; and theprac- tical remarks which follow will equally apply to thesamekind of diseased structure whether it exist separately by itself, or occupy the situation of an original gland. The structure of tumours is also a part of morbid anatomy which deserves to be examined; since (as it did not come within the scope of the under- taking) it has not been fully discussed by Dr. Baillie in his very valuable treatise on that subject. Yet as he has given represent- ations ofglandular parts enlarged by adiseased

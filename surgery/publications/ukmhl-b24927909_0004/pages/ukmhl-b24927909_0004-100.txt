A CLASSIFICATION â€˜)2 breast, which are not cancerous, and to those which are cancerous. What additional cir- cumstances lead to the establishment of cancerous actions in the local disease thus induced, we have yet to learn. Previously to the occurrence of cancer the nervous disorder, and that of the digestive organs, have, in general, been greater in degree, and longer in duration, than they are found to be antecedently to other dis- orders. Some patients having cancer die of organic diseases in the head or abdomen. If the nervous and visceral disorders are active and considerable, the progress of the local disease will be, in general, proportionately rapid and destructive; and if, on the con- trary, these disorders are mild, and less in degree, the progress of the local disease will be proportionally slow and gentle. In con- firmation of these observations, I may men- tion, that I have seen several instances of cancer proceeding so mildly, that the pa- tients have lived many years with little suf- fering or inconvenience from the local dis-

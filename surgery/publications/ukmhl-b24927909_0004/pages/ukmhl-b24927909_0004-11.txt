OF TUMOURS. b 2 nature of cancer, in hopes of discovering something serviceable in that dreadful dis- ease, it becomes right to remark, and it will appear from the following account, that there are many local tumours and ulcers, as in- tractable in their nature, and destructive in their progress, as cancer, which are liable to be confounded with that disease, but which ought to be distinguished from it, before any progress can be made in this difficult part of medical science. The society for the investi- gation of the nature of cancer have enquired about the anatomical structure of that dis- ease, and about other disorders which have a resemblance to it. In the present paper I have attempted to reply to such interroga- tions, as far as my knowledge enables me. It appears to me, that, in order fully to inves- tigate any subject with advantage, a great deal of collateral knowledge is required, which serves, like light shining from various places, to illuminate the object of our re- searches. I am not without hopes that this paper will tend to point out the required distinctions, and furnish such collateral knowledge.

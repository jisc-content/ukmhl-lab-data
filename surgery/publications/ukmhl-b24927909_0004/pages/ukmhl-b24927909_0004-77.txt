I shall arrange the observations which I have offered under three heads; 1st, The history of carcinoma ; 2dly, Its anatomical structure; and, 3dly, I shall compare this disease with others which resemble it. I shall suppose the carcinoma to arise in the female breast, as there it most frequently occurs, and can be best investigated.

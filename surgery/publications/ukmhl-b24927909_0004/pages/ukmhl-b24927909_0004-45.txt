37 OF TUMOURS. to the blood : for a very great quantity of coagulated blood had collected within the wound, and compressed the trachea and pha- rynx to a greater degree than would readily be believed by those who had not witnessed the fact. This circumstance is mentioned to show the impropriety, when there is any chance of haemorrhage, of closing wounds so strictly by sticking-plaster, as to allow no exit to any blood that may be effused; and it is particularly unsafe in circumstances simi- lar to those of the foregoing case. If the haemorrhage be but small in quantity, and the escape of the blood be prevented, it se- parates the sides of the wound, which should lie in close contact, and thereby prevents their immediate union ; and, if it be consi- derable, it deserves to be remarked, that, so far is the compression which the confined blood must make on the arteries, from which it was poured, from stopping the bleeding, that it seems to be a stimulating cause excit- ing an haemorrhagic action in the vessels. This remark is manifested by the present, as well as by many other cases in surgery.

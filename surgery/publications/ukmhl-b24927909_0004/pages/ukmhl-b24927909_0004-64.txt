56 A CLASSIFICATION Pulpy or Medullary Sarcoma. The sarcoma which is next to be described is generally found in the testis, and is dis- tinguished by the name of‘ the soft cancer of’ that part. The term canceris objectionable, because it conveys an erroneous idea of its nature; for this disease, though perhaps equally destructive, will be shown to be unlike cancer in its nature and progress. The tumour, in those cases of the disease which I have most frequently met with, has been of a whitish colour, resembling, on a He took medicines with a view to regulate and improve the functions of his digestive organs, which were much disordered. His general health improved, and under this change, the original ulcer greatly amended in its appearance; the spots remained stationary ; the parts in the axilla became so far sound, as to make it nearly cer- tain that they had been affected only by common irrita- tion, and not by a specific disease. This tranquil state lasted about six weeks, when the original ulcer became • worse; and by the aggravation of that disease, without any increase of the others, his powers became exhausted, and he died.

There seems nothing mysterious or diffi- cult to account for in the effects resulting from an abscess becoming open. If any of the natural cavities of the body were in the same state, inflammation would ensue, and would produce a fever corresponding to it in its nature and degree. From the weak and peculiar state of constitution, subject to chronic abscess, both the local inflammation and the concomitant fever are in general of a peculiar kind: the local inflammation partakes of what would, in general, be de- nominated an erysipelatous nature, and the fever of a violent and rapid hectic. I have, however, known the opening of a lumbar abscess productive of inflammation of a phlegmonoid character in the cyst, and then the constitutional affection was like- wise what we term inflammatory fever.

Those who are advocates for letting lum- bar abscesses open themselves by ulceration, because it imparts less irritation to the cyst than a wound occasions, have in this case their wishes gratified ; a much reduced lum- bar abscess does, when treated in this man- ner, open by ulceration. If there be any truth in the reasoning which I have em- ployed, showing that the constitutional dis- order will be in proportion to the extent of the surface affected with disease, that surface is now comparatively small. It must, however, be granted, that under these favourable circumstances, when the abscess leads to carious bones, the disease is generally, though not constantly, fatal.

As the parts containing the fluids seemed more disposed to increase in dimensions, than to giveway and discharge their contents, the collection was opened where it pointed, and a quantity of serum was discharged. On introducing the finger, some strata of co- agulated blood came away, and this was suc- ceeded by sogreat an haemorrhage, that it be- came necessary to enlarge the wound, in order to search for the bleeding vessels.

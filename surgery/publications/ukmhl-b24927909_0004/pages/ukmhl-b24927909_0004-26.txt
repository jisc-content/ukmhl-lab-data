18 A CLASSIFICATION better to desist from this latter plan of treat- ment, and adopt again the former one, till the disease is by such means rendered inactive. I am so well convinced of the necessity of attending to the time and circumstances in which these remedies are applied, in order to give them their real efficacy in the cure of local diseases, that I have been induced to dwell longer on this subject than may perhaps to some seem necessary. When a blister is made permanent, or a seton or issue is made in the vicinity of a disordered part, it is in fact producing a new but curable disease, in order to detract from an old one, over which we have less controul. But here the same observations apply. We should not produce a new disease till the active state of the original one is diminished, and till it is, as it were, rendered dormant; for otherwise the irritation of the intended remedy will rather tend to the aggravation than the cure of the disorder; it will also increase the febrile disturbance of the consti- tution, by adding to the causes of irritation. 21

A CLASSIFICATION 28 of the surrounding cellular substance, which the pressure of the tumour occasions. As the growth of adipose tumours is regularly and slowly progressive ; as nothing like inflam- mation in general accompanies their increase; their capsules afford a striking instance of an investment acquired simply by a slight con- densation of the surrounding cellular struc- ture, unaffected by inflammation. The cap- sule, which is very thin, adheres but slightly to the tumour; and the principal connection appears to be by vessels, which pass through it to enter the substance of the tumour. These vessels are so small, and the connection so slight, that no dissection is required to se- parate it; for when the tumour is to be re- moved, the hand of the operator can be easily introduced between it and its invest- ment, and it is thus readily turned out of its capsule. The vessels of adipose tumours are neither large nor numerous; they are readily torn when the separation alluded to is attempted, and they scarcely bleed after it has been effected. It is natural to suppose when the

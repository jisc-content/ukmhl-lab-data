178 ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. either with or without some trivial collec- tion of fluid previously being formed in the cavity; and, I regret to add, that of late, in general, the disease thus circumstanced, has terminated fatally. Yet, I think, it will be admitted, that abscesses which open in this manner, open in a manner producing the least possible irritation to the consti- tution ; and that the previous treatment which they have undergone, has materially tended to diminish the risk commonly at- tendant on such diseases. I conclude, then, by relating one case of lumbar abscess, treated in the manner which seems to me best, which terminated fatally, as an ex- ample of what, I fear, will be the frequent termination of such cases. I will add, however, several cases, to show that lumbar abscesses, when open, are not necessarily destructive diseases; and to suggest the treatment which ought to be pursued under such adverse circumstances.

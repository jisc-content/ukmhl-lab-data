SURGICAL OBSERVATIONS. ON CHRONIC AND LUMRAR ABSCESSES. Chronic abscesses differ from those pro- duced by phlegmonoid inflammation in many particulars. In diseases of an active and violent nature, the contiguous parts be- come affected, whilst in those of an indolent disposition they remain free from disease, and unaltered in structure.

On the contrary, if one or two of these glands undergo active inflam- mation, the surrounding parts participate in the affections, and all traces of the glands primarily affected, are lost in the more gene- ral inflammation and abscess.

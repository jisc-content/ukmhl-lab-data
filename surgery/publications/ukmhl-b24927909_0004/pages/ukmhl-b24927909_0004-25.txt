OF TUMOURS. 17 This indication is generally attempted by the use of stimulants, such as frictions with mercurial ointment, pressure, and electricity, or by means which also excite some counter-irritation, as rubefacient plas- ters, solutions of salts, blisters, and issues. Both reason and experience equally demon- strate the impropriety of using the stimulat- ing plan till the disease is first tranquillized, and in a degree subdued. It is reasonable to expect that stimulating measures will increase the actions which are going on in the dis- eased part; and experience proves that dis- eases are often increased by those very means which, had they been employed at a proper time, might have effected their cure. This may be elucidated by a fact which is, I believe, generally known and admitted, that if a blister be applied for the cure of a pleu- risy before evacuations are made use of, and the activity of the disease be thus checked, it aggravates the disease ; if afterwards, it speedily effects a cure. If a tumour or any local disease be for a timebenefitedby stimu- lating discutients, and the diseased actions recur in it with a degree of activity, it is VOL. IV. C

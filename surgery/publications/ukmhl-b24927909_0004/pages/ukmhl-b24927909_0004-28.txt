A CLASSIFICATION 20 This genus contains many species, to a description of which I next proceed. The first of which I shall treat, being apparently composed of the coagulable part of the blood, rendered very generally vascular by the growth of vessels through it, without having any noticeable peculiarity in their distribution, mav therefore be called Common Vascular, or organized Sarcoma. The names by which I have distinguished the different species of sarcoma have been objected to, because they are derived from internal circumstances, and not from any information which can be acquired prior to an operation. I have not, however, been able to devise any better mode of denomi- nating these tumours: for all the species must agree in the external characters, those of an increase of bulk, and a fleshy feel. If, however, an arrangement of tumours were once made, so that the history of each species could be particularly remarked, we might perhaps be able, from this circum- stance, to form a probable opinion of the na- ture of the tumour, and of the modeoftreat- ment which it would require; and, by advert-

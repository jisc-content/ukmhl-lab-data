ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. 15 8 do so. When the abscess has become open by the ulceration of one of the punc- tures, which the surgeon has made in order to reduce its dimensions, or so to alter its state as to increase his chance of dispersing it, the patient must encounter the risk at- tendant on the disease ; but the surgeon has still much to do. The ulcerated part should be dressed with mild salve; evaporating washes, or poultices, should be applied over it ; in short, every means should be em- ployed to prevent the cyst inflaming, in consequence of irritation imparted to it from the ulcerated puncture. Perfect quie- tude seems to be essential at this period of the case; for motion of the loins will induce or aggravate inflammation in the original diseased parts. Sometimes a con- siderable time elapses before the cyst in- flames ; and when it does, opium should be given to quiet it. Sometimes the irritation and inflammation of the cyst subsides; and the abscess becoming indolent, the con- stitution is no longer disturbed, and the patient may be permitted to exercise for the benefit of his general health.

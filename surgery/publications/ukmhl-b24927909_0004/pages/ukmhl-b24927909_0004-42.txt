A CLASSIFICATION 34 of the cavity which had contained the pus. I have also seen osseous matter deposited within the substance of an adipose tumour. Pancreatic Sarcoma. The next spieces of sarcomatous tumour, which I shall describe, resembles in appear- ance the pancreas, and, on that account, may be named (if the etymological import of the word be not considered as prohibitory) Pancreatic Sarcoma. This new-formed substance is made up of irregularly shaped masses: in colour, texture, and size resembling the larger masses which compose the pancreas. They appear also to be connectedwith each other, like the.portions of that gland, by a fibrous substance of a looser texture. This kind of sarcoma, though sometimes formed distinctly in the cellular substance, more frequently occurs in the fe- male breast, perhaps orignating in lymph- atic glands ; and, as cases of this kind suf- ficiently illustrate its nature and progress, and appear more interesting in proportion 19

We do not, however, find such fever produced by the absorption of foetid matter from the surfaces of large ulcers. We fre- quently apply the term “ putrid” to sub- stances merely foetid, as well as to those in a state of chemical putrefaction; and from this inaccuracy of language, I suspect the equal inaccuracy of opinion has arisen, which has led to the belief of deleterious consequences succeeding to the absorption of matter. I need not discuss these subjects further, because the enquiry into the true cause of the fever will furnish arguments to refute false notions. An attentive examination of the subject will, I believe, convince us, that the fever depends upon the state of irritation and in- flammation which takes place in the cyst of the abscess. First, because its violence corresponds with the degree of local inflam- mation. Thus, in the old method of opening

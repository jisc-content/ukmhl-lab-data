ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. 14â€˜i pus from it. That it is not owing to the former, we infer, because air does not ap- pear to be stimulating to those surfaces of the animal body, to which it is not natu- rally applied. The air which escapes from a wounded lung, and renders the cellular substance emphysematous, produces no in- flammation of it. Air has also been blown into different cavities of the body, to ascer- tain its effects ; and it has been absorbed from them without having excited any in- flammation. Neither does air appear to be stimulating to the exposed surfaces of ulcers which are in a state of disease. Yet, though air seems to have no stimu- lating property to such surfaces, and, there- fore, cannot be assigned as the cause of that irritation and inflammation consequent to the opening of an abscess, yet it is of the highest importance in pursuing the treat- ment which I have recommended in these abscesses, that no bubble of air should be admitted into the cavity, because it would probably cause the putrefaction of the fluid contained in the abscess, the absorption of which would be very deleterious. To show the consequences that might arise from such

A CLASSIFICATION 64 ease last described; and that the disease had extended, through the medium, and in the course of the absorbing vessels, downwards to the ham, where the glands were enlarged, and formed a considerable tumour; and up- wards into the pelvis, where the internal iliac glands more than filled one side of that cavity, rising out of it, as has been said, so as to distend the lower part of the abdomen. The disease had also extended so as slightly to affect the lumbar glands. The tumours in the ham and pelvis were of the same struc- ture as the original tumour. The ingui- nal glands, though affected apparently by the same disease, were not considerably enlarged. This case also shows the uncommon faci- lity with which this disease is propagated along the absorbing vessels; and its having- extended downwards to the ham, as well as upwards into the pelvis, confirms the opi- nion, that it extends itself by imparting ir- ritation to the vessels, as well as, perhaps, by furnishing a matter, which, if imbibed, may communicate the same irritation.

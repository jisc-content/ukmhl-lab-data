55 OF TUMOURS. nal absorbent glands were, however, un- affected. Since the above account was written, I examined a body in which such tubercles were found very generally scattered beneath the skin. The patient was said to have died of a cancerous uterus, and the cervix was in a state of ulceration. The whole uterus was diseased, and the parietes were an inch in thickness. The disease, however, was not carcinomatous. From this case, as well as from others, which are related, it appears, that the same disorder of the general health may produce local diseases of a dissimilar appearance or nature.* * Since the publication of the former edition, I have seen a case, which is to me so singular, that I wish briefly to mention it. A gentleman had a spot in the skin, op- posite to the inferior angle of the scapula. It had the appearance of one of those spots called petechiae. It en- larged, thickened, and ulcerated. The ulcer became foul and intractable, and the patient came to London with his health much disordered, apparently from local irri- tation. The axillary glands became affected and enlarged to a considerable size, and suppurated. Smaller spots resembling petechiae came out in various parts of his body. E 4

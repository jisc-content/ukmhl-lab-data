â€˜26 A CLASSIFICATION face of the tumour next the skin the capsule firmly adhered to it, in consequence of the inflammation which had taken place. The substance of which the tumour was composed appeared to have been originally of a coagu- lable nature, and the vessels which ramified through it appeared to be rather large than numerous; yet this appearance might have arisen from an imperfect injection. This single case is sufficient to convey all the general information on this subject which I have obtained. It is unnecessary to add parallel instances; and I am un- willing to load the account with minute particulars, lest they should obscure the principal facts. Probably from the want of knowledge I may have included, without discrimination, many varieties in this species of tumour; and, perhaps, further observations will furnish more specific distinctions in these diseases. The subject is but begun ; and the difficulty of the in- vestigation will, I hope, apologize for the small advances which I have been as yet able to make.

3 y . OF TUMOURS. female mamma arise from a disordered state of the health in general, and consequently that the most judicious and effectual mode of dispersing them, is by correcting that ge- neral disorder. Such cases are very numer- ous, and very important, as the reader may see, by referring to the few that I have printed ; yet all, or most of these, would be consigned to removal by the knife, were the idea which I have mentioned to become pre- valent. When, however, a tumour that can- notbedispersed by the means to which I.now refer exists in or about the breast, and which we feel assured is not of a carcinomatous nature, it may be well to remove it, because it is often a constant source of disturbance and alarm to the patientâ€™s mind ; and I am ready to admit, that it is likely to be a nidus in which cancerous actions may be engen- dered in a constitution predisposed to that disease. However I feel myself fully war- ranted in asserting, from my own experience, that many of them will remain in the same state for a great length of time, and even through life, without becoming cancerous.

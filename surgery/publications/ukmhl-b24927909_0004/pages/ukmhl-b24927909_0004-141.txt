ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. 133 nous abscesses, the inflammation which was most violent in the centre, and had there terminated in suppuration, had, at. the same time, induced adhesion of the sur- rounding cellular substance ; and thus the sides of the abscess are, as it were, walled in and supported; and the extension of the disease in the circumference is to a certain degree prevented. It also appears, that it is very much owing to the parts covering the front of the abscess partici- pating in the irritation, that the matter so readily makes its way to the surface, and is discharged. On the contrary, in chronic abscesses it generally happens, that very little adhesion of the surrounding substance takes place, and the matter is more at liberty to extend itself in all directions; at the same time, the parts covering it do not participate in the disease, they therefore do not inflame and ulcerate till their distension induces them to do so, and such a degree of distension may not take place till the abscess has ac- quired an enormous magnitude. k 3

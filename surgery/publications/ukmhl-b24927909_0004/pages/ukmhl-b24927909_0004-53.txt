Dr. llaillie has favoured us with an elegant and correct representation of this disease in his Series of Engravings intended to illustrate the Morbid Anatomy of some of the most important Parts of the Human Body.* I have known this alteration of structure the it consequence of a blow received on the part: but, in general, it occurs without evident injury.

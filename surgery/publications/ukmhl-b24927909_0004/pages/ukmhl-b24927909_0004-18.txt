A CLASSIFICATION the organization of a gland becomes changed into that unnatural structure which is ob- servable in tumours, it may be thought in some degree to contradict those observ- ations : but in this case the substance of the gland is the matrix in which the tumour is formed. The structure of a tumour is sometimes like that of the parts near which it grows. Those which are pendulous into joints, are of a cartilaginous or osseous fabric; fatty tumours frequently form in the midst of adipose substance, and I have seen some tu- mours growing from the palate, and having a slender attachment, which in structure re- sembled the palate. Sometimes, however, they do not resemble in structure the parts from which they grow. The instance just mentioned, of the pendulous portion of fat growing from the peritoneum, will serve as a proof: the vessels, which had shot into it, made the tumour into fat, whilst the neck was of a fibrous and vascular structure. I have seen osseous tumours unconnected with bone or periosteum; and indeed, in general,

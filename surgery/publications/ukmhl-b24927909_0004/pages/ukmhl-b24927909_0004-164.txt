ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. 15(\ becoming open spontaneously, he should still pursue the same measures; for the ne- cessity of his puncturing it again is thereby diminished, and he gains time, which he employs in endeavouring to invigorate the constitution, and diminish the disease of the bone, upon which, perhaps, the abscess depends. Suppose, however, he is unable to effect his chief design, that of dispersing the abscess ; suppose, after having punc- tured it five or six times, at long intervals, one of the punctures inflames and ulcerates, it must, I think, be evident, that great good has been effected by the measures that have been pursued. After a lumbar abscess has been punctured, the fluids secreted into it will flow into that part where there is the least resistance, which is the part that has been punctured. The pressure of respiration will urge them from the original cavity into the now vacant space, where the abscess had presented itself. The original cavity, being a long time thus kept empty, will contract into a small fis- tulous tube.

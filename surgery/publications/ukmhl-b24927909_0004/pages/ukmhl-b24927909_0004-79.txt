71 OF TUMOURS. f 4 coma the disease is propagated along the ab- sorbing system, but the parts immediately in contact with the enlarged glands do not as- sume the same diseased actions. Neither in the tuberculated species does the ulceration spread along the skin, but destroys that part only where it covers the diseased glands. It was observed by Mr. Hunter, that a dis- position to cancer exists in the surrounding parts, prior to the actual occurrence of the diseased action. This remark, which is veri- fied by daily experience, led to the following- rule in practice : “ That a surgeon ought not to be contented with removing merely the indurated or actually diseased part, but that he should also take away some portion of the surrounding substance, in which a dis- eased disposition may probably have been excited.” In consequence of this communi- cation of disease to the contiguous parts, the skin soon becomes indurated, and attached to a carcinomatous tumour, which, in. like manner, becomes fixed to the muscles, or other parts over which it was formed.

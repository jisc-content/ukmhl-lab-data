140 ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. render the abscess stationary, or to diminish it, by lessening the secretion into the cavity, and by promoting absorption from it. I may also add, that I have seen several abscesses, which continued to enlarge under such ma- nagement in the first instance, dispersed by it, after they had been once punctured. The foregoing remarks and cases are de- signed to illustrate the nature of chronic ab-* scesses in general, and I now proceed to consi- der the most important species of such a dis- ease that we meet with in practice, Imeanthe lumbar abscess. Some lumbar abscesses can, indeed, searcely be denominated chronic; they are formed with so much pain, the pus which they contain being good, and so un- like what is generally found in the cysts of indolent abscesses, that we must suppose the disease which produced it was of a different nature. I have seen also inflammatory fever induced when such an abscess has become open, which was an additional proof of its being of a phlegmonoid nature. Such oc- currences are, indeed, very rare; but it very commonly happens that the formation of

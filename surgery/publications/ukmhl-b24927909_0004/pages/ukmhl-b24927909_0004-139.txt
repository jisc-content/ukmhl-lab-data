131 OF TUMOURS. I suspect some diseased peculiarity to exist, as has been mentioned in speaking of that subject. In the tuberculated sarcoma the predisposition to that disease seems general on the part of the constitution. In the me- dullary sarcoma the disease seems local, in the first instance, and propagated by means of the absorbing vessels to their glands, and frequently in a course retrograde to that which the absorbed fluids would naturally take ; but in the advanced state of the dis- ease the morbid disposition appears to be general. In carcinomatous sarcoma the dis- ease appears to begin in a point or small district, and to extend in every direction, as rays do from a centre, affecting every sur- rounding part, whatever may be its nature. The diseased actions, also, though they may be at times more violent or more tranquil, never cease. This disease is also extended through the medium of the absorbing vessels in the direction which the absorbed matter would naturally take.

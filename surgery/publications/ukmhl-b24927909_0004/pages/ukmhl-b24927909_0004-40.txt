A CLASSIFICATION 32 come for relief. Mr. Cline gave him more direct hopes of success than he received else- where, and he went into St. Thomasâ€™s Hos- pital to submit to the operation. When Mr. Cline had divided the skin and fascia of the thigh, the tumour was easily turnedout; but it had unfortunately acquired a ligamentous adhesion to the orbicular liga- ment of the hip, which could not be separ- ated without, in some degree, injuring that part. This attachment appeared to be about half an inch in breadth, and about one fourth of an inch in length. The cause and nature of this firm attachment to the ligament of the hip seems the only circumstance peculiar to this case, or requiring explanation. It appears to me easily accounted for, by sup- posing the tumour to have compressed and irritated that part, and thus to have occasion- ed an adhesion, at first of a glutinous nature, but which afterwards becoming organized, had assumed the structure of the parts from whence it proceeded. In like manner tumours growing near, and compressing the surface of bones, frequently occasion a de- cree of exostosis. O

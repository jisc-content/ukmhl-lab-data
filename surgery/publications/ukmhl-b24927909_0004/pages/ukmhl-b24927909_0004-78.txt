This observation will serve to distinguish it from many other dis- eases, which, at their first attack, involve a considerable portion, if not the whole of the part where they occur. The progress of car- cinoma is more or less quick in different in- stances. When slow, it is in general unre- mitting ; at least I am inclined to think that the disease, though it may be checked, can- not be made to recede by that medical treat- ment which lessens the bulk of other sarco- matous tumours. This circumstance affords, in my opinion, another criterion, by which it may, in general, be distinguished. This obdurate and destructive disease excites the contiguous parts, whatever their nature may be, to the same diseased action. The skin, the cellular substance of muscles, and the periosteum of bones, all become affected, if they are in the vicinity of cancer. This very striking circumstance in the history of carcinoma distinguishes it from most of the diseases already described. In the pulpy sar-

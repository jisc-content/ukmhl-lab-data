Dur- ing this time she had taken emetics occa- sionally, but her health was far from good, and the pain in her loins was still consider- able.â€” I had now witnessed the beneficial effects of electricity in the case of the last patient, and resolved upon trying it here. It was accordingly employed three times a week, for three weeks. At first a small col- lection of fluid in the abscess was percep- tible ; but this was gradually absorbed ; and by the end of the third week there was no longer any pain in her loins, her health was greatly improved, and she was able to walk about, without the least appearance of her former complaint. She was, therefore, dis- charged from the house, but came once a week, for some time, to be electrified. * The two last cases point out to notice a remedy that is likely to be of much advan- tage in the future treatment of lumbar ab- o * This patient remains at present in perfect health: nor is there any reason to expect a relapse.

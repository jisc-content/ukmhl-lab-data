OF TUMOURS. 49 glandular parts perhaps; which might, with propriety, be considered as a variety ol the same species of sarcoma. It has the same uniformity of surface, but it is not always of a white colour, being occasionally of a brownish or reddish tint. I have seen a sub- stance of this kind forming a tumour sur- rounding and compressing the oesophagus, and causing a con traction of thattube. I have seen this kind of sarcoma in glandular parts, in which the progress and event of the ease did not indicate the diseasetobeof a noxious nature. The general result of my observ- ations, however, has induced me to believe, that this diseased structure is prone to dege- nerate into an intractable ulcer, which will communicate its disease to the surrounding O parts, and I have therefore placed this spe- cies of sarcoma between those which seem to possessnomalignity, and thosewhich follow, and which are of a very destructive nature. 1 add the relation of a Case which oc- curred at St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital, since the publication of the former edition of this paper.

OF TUMOURS. 5 diseases of arteries, veins, glands, tendons, joints, and bones, brought together under one order, and designated by the same name of tumours. Some of these also are merely enlargements of natural parts ; whilst others are entirely new productions, having no ex- istence in the original composition of the body. We have, I believe, sufficient know- ledge of the nature of these diseases to class them more scientifically; and as this has not yet, as far as I know*, been done, I shall endeavour to supply the deficiency. In the definition which I mean to give of tumours, I shall trespass as much against the usual import of the word, as nosologists have hitherto done in their classifications against the nature of the disease. For I shall restrict the surgical signification of the word “ Tu- mour” to such swellings as arise from some new production, which made no part of the * Plenck published, 1767, a work entitled “ Systema Tumorum,” which I have not seen, but I conclude that it does not resemble the present attempt; since no ar- rangement, like that which I have made, is to be met with in the Encyclopedic Methodique.

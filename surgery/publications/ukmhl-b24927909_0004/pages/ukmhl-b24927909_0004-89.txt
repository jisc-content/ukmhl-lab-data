OF TUMOURS. 81 parts get well, whilst the surrounding parts become diseased. I have known diseases beginning in ulceration, and followed by induration, and the growth of fungus ex- tend themselves unremittingly, so as to de- stroy the patient. I have seen diseases of this description occur in the labia pudendi, some of which have terminated fatally, whilst others were removed even at an advanced period of the disease with success. Here some additional discriminating cir- cumstances seem to be wanted, by which we may distinguish between these ulcers and common carcinoma. I have never remarked, that such ulcers have affected the absorbent glands, though I do not feel assured that this occurrence never takes place. It there- fore remains to be determined by future cases, how far this circumstance may en- able us to decide on the nature of these dis- eases. I shall next relate the principal circumstances of a remarkable case of this kind of disease, which will serve to elucidate the subject, and also to exhibit a specimen of the diseases to which I allude.

Great fever and irritation accompanied this local disorder, and the girl died. * * An unrestrainable haemorrhagic tendency seems to be the essential character of that disease, which Mr. Hey has denominated Haematodes. That it takes place from diseased structures is manifest; yet I have known it hap- pen without any morbid growth having preceded it. I shall briefly relate a case of this description, because the term fungus haematodes seems to be a name commonly now applied to every bleeding fungus, whilst that haematodal disposition, which Mr. Hey has described, is a very

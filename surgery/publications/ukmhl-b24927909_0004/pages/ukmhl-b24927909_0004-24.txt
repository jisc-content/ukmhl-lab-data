16 A CLASSIFICATION missible a substance*, so in proportion as the temperature of the skin is diminished by evaporation, it derives heat from the sub- jacent parts, and thus are their morbid ac- tions lessenedf. If by such means the growth of a tumour be suspended, another curative indication naturally arises, which is to promote the absorption of the new formed substance. * Though this expression may not be correct, the idea which is designed to be conveyed by it, will, I believe, be understood. f The regulation of the temperature of diseased parts, seems to be an important object in the treatment of local diseases; and it is very possible, that by producing eva- poration from the surface we may chill them. Patients, therefore, ought to be apprised, that our object in the use of evaporating washes, is merely to prevent an unna- tural degree of heat. It is not necessary that the washes should be applied cold to accomplish this object. A chilly sensation imparted to a portion of the skin may affect the whole surface, and produce that affection which we call a cold. In many cases a bread and water poultice seems to me the best application we can employ, both with a view to abstract superfluous heat, and on account of its soothing properties. It is indeed a local warm bath, and, like the bath, it induces a gentle per- spiration from the surface.

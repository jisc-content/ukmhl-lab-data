OF TUMOURS. 19 c 2 It should also be borne in mind, that the intended remedy is a disease of our own creating; and if it be a painful one, that it may, by disturbing the constitution, do more harm in this way to the original disease than good by its counter-irritation. Such are the local means of treating tu- mours, as well as other local diseases, and to these I shall have occasion to refer. I can- not speak of the general means usually em- ployed to operate on these disorders without entering into a long, and, I think, an unne- cessary discussion. In attempting a classification of tumours, I shall suppose that they may be made to con- stitute an Order in the class of local diseases in nosology ; and the meaning of the word may be restricted in the manner suggested,to substances of new formation, which made no part in the original structure of the body; the order may then be divided into genera ; and the first genus maybe denominated from, its most obvious character, (that of having a firm and fleshy feel,) Sarcoma, or Sarcoma- tous tumours.

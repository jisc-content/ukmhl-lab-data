A CLASSIFICATION 70 manner in diseases which can be propagated by irritation. When the glands of the axilla are obstructed by disease, the absorbed mat- ter will pass by anastomosing channels, into the internal mammary absorbents, and if occasionally one or two glands in the neck are found diseased, they may become af- fected in the same manner, by the fluids being obliged to take a circuitous route.* There is another circumstance in the his- tory of cancer, which deserves attention and investigation ; that is, Whether a disease not originally cancerous can become so in its progress? We can only form our opinions on this subject from analogy and observation. Analogy leads us to believe, that such an alteration in the diseased actions may readily take place. Venereal buboes often change their nature after the administration of mer- cury, and become troublesome sores to which * It may be proper to enquire, Whether those tumours, which arise in the circumference of carcinoma, are not caused by the absorbed matter being made to stop for a time in the vessels, and thus to afford that irritation which induces disease in them and the contiguous parts?

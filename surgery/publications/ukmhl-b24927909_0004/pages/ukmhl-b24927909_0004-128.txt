I have seen the cysts containing hydatids, in the back and about the hip, on the shoulder and in front of the elbow joint.* I never met with any * The cysts from which such substances are discharged are, in general, very irritable. If they are kept open for some time an alteration seems to take place in the ac- tions of the part, and they no longer continue to secrete that matter which forms the granules I have described, nor the fluid in which hydatids are found. As these dis- eases are not so frequent as to be familiarly known to surgeons whose practice is not extensive, I will relate two cases to show the nature and treatment of such dis- eases. â€” Cask.

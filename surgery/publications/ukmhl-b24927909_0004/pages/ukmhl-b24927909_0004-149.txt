ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. 1 M lumbar abscesses is attended with more pain and other inflammatory symtoms, than are incident to chronic abscess in general. Whatever the nature of a lumbar abscess may be, the surgical treatment of it must be similar to that of a chronic abscess; for as the matter presents in a part of the body which is so remote from that where it was originally formed, as not to sympathize with the disease, so the progress of the abscess, before breaking, will resemble that of a chronic abscess. To use the language of Mr. Hunter, a lumbar abscess, where it presents, is to be considered as an abscess in the part, and not as an abscess of the part. As lumbar abcesses in general descend along the psoas muscle, under Poupartâ€™s ligament, and present beneath the fascia of the thigh, the resistance of the fascia affords an additional obstacle to the progress of the matter to the surface, so that such abscesses, if left to themselves, often acquire an enor- mous magnitude before they spontaneously open.

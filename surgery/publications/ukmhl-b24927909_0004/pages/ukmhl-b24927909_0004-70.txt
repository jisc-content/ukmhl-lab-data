62 A CLASSIFICATION higher up, renders it probable that it in- duces the disease, as well by imparting irritation to them, as by furnishing a matter capable of stimulating them when they have imbibed! it; an opinion that will be more strikingly verified by the next case which I shall relate.* This species of sarcoma, though it usually affects the testis, occasionally occurs in other parts. I shall authenticate this fact by the brief relation of another case, which will serve also to throw additional light on the nature and progress of this disease. CASE XT. A boy, about twelve years of age, was brought to the hospital for advice, on ac- count of a tumour in the front of his thigh; # The progress of what is called the scirrhous testis is similar to that of the disease which I am describing, and of course very different from that of genuine carcino- ma. It is not improbable, that from the similarity of the progress of these two diseases, and the equal fatality having been remarked, they first acquired the contrasted names of soft and hard cancers of the testis.

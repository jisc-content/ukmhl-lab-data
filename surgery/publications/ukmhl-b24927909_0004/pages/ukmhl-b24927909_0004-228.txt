ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. 220 and dry skin. As the pain and fever went off, they were succeeded by an increased discharge from the abscess, and irregular perspirations, which gradually abating, the abscess at length became indolent, and no longer affected the constitution. Warned by her former experience, she now took exercise very cautiously; and when she found she could bear motion without ex- citing irritation in the abscess, she went into the country, where she regained her health; the abscess healed, and she has since continued perfectly well. When a permanent opening is made in a lumbar abscess, the part generally falls into a morbid state, and this is accompanied by a sympathetic affection of the constitution, corresponding in its nature with the local complaint. In the first of the two cases just now related, both the local and constitu- tional disease were of a more purely inflam- matory kind than in any other that I had ever seen, nor was it succeeded by that ill-con- ditioned state of the sore, accompanied with a thin foetid discharge and hectic symptoms, which so frequently occur in this disorder.

A CLASSIFICATION 12 the consequence of some diseased action of the surrounding vessels which may influence the organization and growth of the tu- mours. In the former cases, the parts surrounding the tumour may be considered simply as the sources from which it derives its nutriment, whilst it grows apparently by its own inhe- rent powers, and its organization depends upon actions begun and existing in itself. If such a tumour be removed, the surround- ing parts, being sound, soon heal, and a complete cure ensues. But if a tumour be removed, whose existence depended on the disease of the surrounding parts, which are CASE. A medical practitioner bruised the upper part of his thigh against the pummel of a saddle, in consequence of his horse starting. The bruise and slight inflammation attendant on this accident soon disappeared, but after some months, he perceived a small tumour, which gra- dually increased, till' it acquired a considerable magni- tude. He came to London, and had it removed. It was an adipose tumour, and had a distinct capsule inclosing it, formed by the condensation of the cellular substance in which it had grown.

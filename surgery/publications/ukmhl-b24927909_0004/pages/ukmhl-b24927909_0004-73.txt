65 OF TUMOURS. I have mentioned, as a variety of this disease, that in which the colour is different, it beiim between a brown and that of the O blood; but in texture and organization it does not appear dissimilar. It seems, there- fore, as if the diseased action caused the secretion of a fluid, sometimes of a milky, sometimes of a more dusky hue; which gra- dually acquires solidity, and augments the bulk of the part. The diseased part ac- quires in general a considerable solidity when it has continued for some time, so as scarcely to deserve the names of soft cancer, or medullary sarcoma. The hardness is also, in some instances which I have seen, increased, apparently by a thickening of the cellular substance which pervades the gland. It seems probable, however, that the same kind of diseased action may not be always followed by the like alteration of structure, in the part which it affects. Sir Astley Cooper, in his paper on Obstruc- tions of the Thoracic Duct, mentions an instance in which matter imbibed from a testis affected with a disease like the pre- VOL. IV. f

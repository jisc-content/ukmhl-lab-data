126 A CLASSIFICATION The treatment of encysted tumours re- sembles that of the sarcomatous kind. By abstracting blood and heat from the part it is probable the growth of them will be stopped, and the disease made for a time stationary. They are not likely to be dis- persed ; and, as the magnitude is increased by delay, and the spontaneous opening of the cyst generally leaves a vexatious and intractable sore, and sometimes is attended with more dangerous consequences, the early removal of the disease is the best practical conduct that can be pursued. rare occurrence. — Case. A young man, who was out of health, complained of stiffness and pain in the bottom of his belly, and took to his bed, declaring his inability to move about.

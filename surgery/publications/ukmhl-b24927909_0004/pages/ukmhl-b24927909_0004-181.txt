In one instance where I employed it after the abscess had been once punctured, it kept the matter from collecting for a long time ; but the patient growing tired of the confinement, and apprehensive lest the lancet should be again employed, left the hospital without my knowledge.—Of another, and somewhat analogous disease, in which it was tried, though not with complete success, I shall here relate the particulars ; first, remarking, that all the observations which I have made on electricity applied to diseased parts, lead me to conclude, that it acts as a stimulus, which has the peculiar effect of accelerating that process which happens to be going on at the time. — Thus, in some states of in- flammation, it hastens suppuration, whilst in others it promotes dispersion.

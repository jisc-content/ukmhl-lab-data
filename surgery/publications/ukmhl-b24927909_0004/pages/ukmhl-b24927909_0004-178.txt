170 ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. the abscess. Very small electric shocks* were accordingly sent from different parts by the side of the lumbar vertebrae, down to the groin, and upper part of the affected thigh ; and, under this treatment, the con- tents of the abscess soon disappeared ; nor did any further collection of matter take place during the time of her remaining in the house, which was nearly two months. The electricity also brought on the men- strual discharge, which for a long time had been very irregular; and her general health was greatly improved before she left the hospital, f * These small shocks, which, for the sake of distinc- tion, I shall call electric vibrations (a term, I believe, generally applied to them), wâ€™ere made by discharging a small jar, the coated surface of which did not exceed fourteen square inches : and by placing the ball of the electrometer at a small distance from the conductor, ge- nerally about a quarter of an inch. One of the discharg- ing rods was then moved about on the upper part of the thigh, and the other on the loins, so that the electric fluid might pass through the abscess. f 1 have lately heard, that the abscess has not appeared again, though a year has since elapsed; but the pain in her loins has (as might have been expected) recurred.

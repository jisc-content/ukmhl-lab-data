ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. 149 Having thus endeavoured to investigate the causeof the evils resulting from a chronic abscess becoming open, I may further add, that if the opinions which I have formed of them be correct, the danger must greatly depend upon the dimensions of the abscess. A chronic abscess, beneath the fascia of the thigh, may be opened when it contains four ounces of pus ; and if the surface becomes irritated and inflamed, it may induce a de- gree of constitutional disturbance and fever; yet such an abscess neglected may increase till it holds four quarts*; and then, if it becomes open, and has the same degree of local disease, and it were granted that it should only act upon the constitution in the same proportion, it must produce more than thirty times the degree of fever. If, also, we are to ascribe the weakness consequent to the opening of chronic abscesses in any degree to the drain of fluids which takes place from them, it will be in the same proportion * I have discharged four ale-house quarts full of mat- ter from beneath the fascia of the thigh.

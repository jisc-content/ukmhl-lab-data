ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. 188 let out during my absence. I now dis- charged, in like manner, ten ounces of lymphatic exhalation, rather dark coloured and turbid, as if mixed with true pus. The man, during the last week, had complained of pain in his loins, and in his knee, both of which were relieved as usual by the oper- ation. Before the abscess was first opened, the impulse of matter from the loins, on cough- ing, was extremely forcible, but was now not at all perceptible. It appears to me, that a very considerable advantage is de- rived from this mode of treating these.com- plaints. Whatever secretion is made in the abscess of the loins, will, by its gravity, descend into the space left by the seceded fascia of the thigh. The abscess of the loins being left perfectly free from disten- tion, will most probably contract to very little dimensions, if it be not perfectly abolished. Hence, in the subsequent treat- ment of these complaints, you have only to attend to the disunited fascia; whilst the cavity in the loins scarcely deserves notice.

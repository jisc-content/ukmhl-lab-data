152 ON LUMBAR ABSCESSES. often fail in our endeavours to disperse them, is, indeed, highly probable in reason, and equally proved by occurrences in practice. Let us then suppose that a lumbar ab- scess treated in this manner continues to increase; that it protrudes the integuments; that they, from distension, become irritated; that their temperature is slightly augmented; what are we then to do ? Are we to wait till evident signs of inflammation appear? I think not. I would then relieve them from distension, by emptying the abscess through a wound made bv an abscess lancet. cj J I would open the abscess for a reason which appears paradoxical on its first proposal ; which is, that it may be kept closed. We can empty a cavity, and, by healing the wound, keep it afterwards shut, and no in- flammation ensues. If nature opens the cavity by ulceration, the opening is perma- nent, andthe inflammation consequent must be endured. When I first treated abscesses in this manner, I punctured them with a trochar: I now use an abscess lancet; which is introduced with very little obliquity, so far

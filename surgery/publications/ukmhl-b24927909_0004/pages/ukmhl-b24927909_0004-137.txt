129 OF TUMOURS. actions themselves do not admit of examina- tion, though the structures do which they erect. Therefore, as Dr. Baillie has observed, it is by an examination of diseased structure that we must be slowly led to a knowledge of diseased actions. It does not follow as a certain consequence, that similar diseased actions will, in every instance, produce pre- cisely the same diseased structure; though it is highly probable that they will do so in general. This observation would diminish our surprize, if, in some rare instances, we found cancer existing where a cancerous structure was not strikingly manifest; or if, in others, a structure like that of cancer was observed where no cancerous actions were apparent. The scirrhous tumours, which form beneath the peritoneal covering or lin- ing of the uterus, have something of the structure of cancer, and yet they are not cancerous. In all cases where tumours are formed, we must suppose an increase, and, in some degree, a disordered action of the vessels which form them ; but in many these actions possess but little diseased peculiarity. As in every case of growth in the re-production of destroyed parts, the you. iv. K

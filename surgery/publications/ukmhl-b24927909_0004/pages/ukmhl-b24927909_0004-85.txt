OF TUMOURS. 77 that medicine is rather detrimental than be- neficial. Injuries induce inflammation and enlargement of parts, which afterwards de- generate into scrofulous diseases. But, though analogy seems so strongly to favour the opinion, I cannot take upon myself to say, that my observations have confirmed it. When tumours have been removed, the * history of which corresponded to that of cancer, a cancerous structure was observed in them ; and, on the contrary, in diseases of an apparently different nature, a different organization has been found. I once, in- deed, assisted at an operation where the tumour was of that kind which I have deno- minated pancreatic; and 1 heard afterwards that the patient died in the country of a dis- ease which was reputed cancerous. Again, in investigating this subject, it deserves to be remarked, and every surgeon must, I believe, be familiarly acquainted with this fact, that many diseased tumours remain in the breast for a great length of time, per- haps during life, without undergoing any change in their nature; or, in other words, without becoming cancerous.

A CLASSIFICATION 116 exhausted by these circumstances, and be- fore any local amendment had taken place, another wen of the same nature, which he had on his right thigh, ulcerated, and was followed by the same consequences, and, ' conjointly, they soon destroyed him. A gentleman, of a stout make, and about forty years of age, had a tumour, supposed to be sarcomatous, which had formed be- neath the integuments on the lower edge of the pectoral muscle. It was attended with severe pain occasionally, at which time it rapidly increased in size, and produced a great deal of fever and irritation*, which made him look very sickly, and grow very thin, and caused some persons to deem the disease cancerous. * Circumstances like these should, I think, be particu- larly attended to in the history of tumours; for they may serve, perhaps, to characterize the disease in which they occur. Tumours of an innocent nature commonly in- crease in an equal ratio, and do not excite irritation in the contiguous parts, or in the constitution. Yet this, as a general rule, has exceptions. Some of these have been stated under the head of pancreatic sarcoma, occurring in or about the mammary gland.

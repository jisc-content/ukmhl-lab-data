If the history of the disease accords with that of carcinoma, that is to say, if it began in a small district, and regularly and unabatingly attained its present magnitude; if the surface of the tumour be unequal, having in various parts produced roundish projecting nodules, the disease will almost invariably be found to be carcinoma. The skin will soon adhere to one or more of these prominences ; it will ulcerate and expose the subjacent parts, and the future progress of the disease will so exactly ac- cord to that of the harder and smaller spe- cimen which I have described, as not to require a separate description.

In carcinoma, as in other diseases, it appears to me, that the history

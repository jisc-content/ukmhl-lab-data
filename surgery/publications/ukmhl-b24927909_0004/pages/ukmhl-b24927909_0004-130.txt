122 A CLASSIFICATION have, therefore, conjectured that these cysts are enlargements of the bursae mucosae. made a division of the skin about two inches in length, to expose the fascia of the fore-arm, which I divided to the extent of an inch and a half. I then distracted the muscles a little, when there gushed out a large quantity of fluid, containing a number of the largest granules that ever I had seen formed in the sheaths of tendons. Se- veral of them were as big as small grapes. By pressing the palm of the hand more were forced out, yet I re- mained uncertain whether the whole were discharged. The wound was dressed superficially with spermaceti salve, a bread and water poultice applied, and the arm kept supported in a sling. Three days after the oper- ation, fearing lest some of the granules might remain, I introduced the point of a varnished catheter, and im- pelled some warm water beneath the fascia of the hand. No granules returned with it: but this experiment caused great nervous irritation in the part, and in the constitution in general. Nothing, therefore, was farther done that could irritate the parts, and the wound healed in about six weeks, in the following manner : The skin on either side of the wound became tumid, and threw forth exuberant granulations to such a height, that a swelling as big as half an egg cut lengthwise, projected above the level of the skin; as the granulations from either side touched, they coalesced, and thus the divided fascia was covered. The granulations being afterwards absorbed, the cicatrix appeared like one from a common cut, and the integuments were flat, and in a natural state. I saw the patient two years after this operation, and there had been no new collection of fluid.

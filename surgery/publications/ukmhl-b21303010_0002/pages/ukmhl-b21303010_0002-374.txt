In this, however, he is wrong, as Mr. Morris has shown that the head of the femur in all forms of dislocation makes its exit from the acetabulum below this tendon. Dislocation upon I'10- 458. the foramen ovale or obturator fora- men is a very striking accident. Sedillot, as well as Boyer, believe that it is the most common of all forms, but Brit- ish and American surgeons usually place it third on the list. In my own table it stands second.

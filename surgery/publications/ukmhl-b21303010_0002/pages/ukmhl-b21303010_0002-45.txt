DISEASES OE THROAT REQUIRING TRACHEOTOMY. 27 invented an instrument composed of a mirror fixed to a wire handle, which, being fixed against the palate whilst the tongue was de- pressed, enabled him to view the upper part of the larynx. Garcia, the singer, in 1855 gave an impulse to the idea by throwing the sun’s rays into the hack of his mouth by means of a mirror held in his left hand; and so from a dentist’s reflector introduced into his mouth he could witness the movements of his larynx in the looking- glass. But to Drs. Czermak and Turck are unquestionably due the credit of having applied this mode of investigation in a scientific way to the diagnosis of laryngeal disease. They employed, however, artificial illumination instead of solar, adopting the practice of Helmholtz in ophthalmoscopic operations. The ordinary mode of application of the instrument is very simple. Mode of use. The patient sits with his hack to a good light, that of the sun is the best, but a moderator or gas lamp will suffice. The lamp should he in a line with the patient’s face, and on his right side ; the surgeon, with the mirror fastened round his head, faces the light and reflects it on the patient. The patient is then directed to open his mouth, protrude Fig. 313. his tongue, and hold it with a handkerchief: a warmed mirror is then introduced to the back of the fauces, while the tongue at this time is depressed. The rays of light from the frontal mirror are then made to fal upon the pharyngeal, and, with a little arrangement, the glottis and aH the parts around, above or below, may be carefully examined Ihe pharyngeal mirror may also be well illuminated by simply pro- jecting the rays of light from a large reflector fastened behind a gas or moderator lamp, as seen in Pig. 313.

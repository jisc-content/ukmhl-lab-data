To the eye, the colloid disease has a peculiar aspect, its jelly-like semi- transparent material of all tints of pink and red from degrees of blood-staining being divided by thin meshes of fibre tissue into cells of different sizes. The way the jelly-like structure oozes from its cells, and the slight changes that take place in it after immersion in spirit, are its chief characteristics. It ought to be treated by excision of the whole gland. Cystic Tumour of the Breast.

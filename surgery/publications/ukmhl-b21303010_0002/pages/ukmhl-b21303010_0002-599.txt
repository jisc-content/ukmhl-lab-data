AMPUTATION. 579 In amputations of the upper extremity the patient should he brought well to the side of the table, and in amputations of the lower ex- tremity well downwards, the opposite limb being secured by a turn of a bandage or strap to the leg of the table. In amputating, the surgeon should always stand on the right-hand Snreeon’s side of the part to be amputated, in order to keep during the operation position, full control with his left hand of the flaps, and possibly, of the main arteries, and afterwards of the stump.

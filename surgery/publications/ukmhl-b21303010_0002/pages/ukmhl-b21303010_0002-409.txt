389 SPECIAL FRACTURES. fourth week, and the latter on a boy, set. 15, thirteen months after the fracture. When the hone has united too firmly to permit of re-fracture, it Osteotomy, should be divided by a subcutaneous section, or, by some cutting opera- tion. Key did this latter operation in the leg, in 1839 (‘ Guy’s Hosp. Rep./ series i, vol. iv), and Lister more recently has done the same (‘Brit. Med. Journ./ 1868). The subcutaneous section should be per- foi’med in a similar way to that adopted by W. Adams in dividing the neck of the thigh-bone with a saw or chisel. These operations, however, are only to be undertaken when the local deformity is great and the limb useless. In the incomplete or green-stick fractures of infancy, if the bone be not straightened, strange deformities ensue. In the case depicted in Pig. 478, such a result was to be seen, the bent tibia and fibula having been much thickened by the deposition of hone in the concavity of the arch, the bone measuring across its centre six inches. It was taken from a girl, twelve years old. SPECIAL FRACTURES.—FRACTURES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Fractures of the cranium and spinal column have already received attention; those of the lower jaw have been described in page 554, \ ol. I, and those of the nose and sternum in chapter xvii. ° Fracture of the clavicle is generally the result of indirect violence Of clavicle such as a fall upon the shoulder, and when of direct it is usually compound or comminuted.

526 TUMOURS OP BONE. Joint usually intact. Cancers of bone. Periosteal and endosteal. made up of the characteristic polynucleated and irregular myeloid cells (Fig. 29). Pig. 591. Myeloid tumours. Guy’s Hosp. Mus. When the tumour encroaches on the joint the cartilage is usually spread out over the tumour, but intact. These tumours were originally mixed up with the cancerous or flbro-plastic of Lebert. They are found likewise in the gums as “ epulis,” and in other parts. In a specimen of myeloid tumour of the upper jaw which I removed from a girl, set. 8, the structure was very dense (‘Guy’s Rep.,' 1873-4-7). Cancers of bone as of other parts show their malignancy in involv- ing the utter destruction of the bone in which they are developed. They may originate in the periosteum or in the bone, but in either case both tissues will be eventually affected. When they originate from the periosteum, the bone may be found in parts running through the mass, Fig. 592. Fracture of the femurfrom muscular action at the seat of a local cancer in a man, set. 28.

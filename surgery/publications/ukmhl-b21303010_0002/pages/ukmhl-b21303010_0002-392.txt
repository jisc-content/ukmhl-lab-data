372 ON FRACTURES. Definition. Varieties of fractures. CHAPTER XXXI. ON FRACTURES. When a bone is broken, it is said to be fractured; when the skin and soft parts covering in the broken bone are whole, the fracture is simple or subcutaneous; when a wound exists communicating with the broken bone, whether the wound be caused directly by the same force that produced the fracture or indirectly by the bone perforating the skin,, the fracture is compound. A simple or compound fracture is said to be complete when the solution of continuity is complete; incomplete, when the bone is only cracked, fissured, or bent, as in â€œ green-stick" fracture, where the bone is splintered on its convex surface and not on its concave; splintered, when only a portion of the bone is cut off either by a sabre wound, in machinery, or by some local injury chipping ofi' the edge of a bone; fissured, when the line of fracture extends partially or wholly through the bone and no separation of the frag- ments exist; impacted, when one end of the broken bone is driven into and fixed in the other. A bone may also be perforated by a gunshot or punctured wound. A complete fracture may be transverse, oblique, longitudinal, dentate, or comminuted; multiple of the same bones, or of contiguous bones, of separate or distinct bones (vide Fig. 472). All fractures may likewise Fig. 472. Transverse. A. Complete Fractuees. Dentated or Longitudinal. Comminuted. b. c. Oblique and Multiple.

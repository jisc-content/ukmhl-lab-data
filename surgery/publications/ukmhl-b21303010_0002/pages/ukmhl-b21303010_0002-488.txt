Operation described. He subsequently treated the case as one of fracture, and at the end of two months the patient had a straight limb. M. Tillaux described the result as splendid, and considered the practice infinitely preferable to the operation of subcutaneous section of the neck of the bone. The operation is, doubtless, of value in certain cases, and worthy of consideration. In 1869, Mr. W. Adams (‘Brit. Med. Journal,’ 1870) successfully treated a case of this nature by subcutaneous division of the neck of the thigh bone by means of a fine saw, and up to October 1876, twenty-two operations of the kind had been performed—five by Mr. Adams, four by myself, and others by Messrs. Jessop, Jowers, Jordan, Lund, of Manchester, Sands of New York, Golding-Bird, and others. The operation was successful in twenty. I look upon this operation with much favour, and believe it to be the best when the femur has a neck to be divided. The instruments required for the operation are such as those figured below (Fig. 556), The operation itself I give in Mr. Adams’s words: Fig. 556. J | i'n

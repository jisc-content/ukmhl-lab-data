AMPUTATION. 574 I Mortality determined l by age. Statistics. | ! By age and j causes. Amputation for acute suppuration very fatal. inch higher than is absolutely called for, in order to execute what may be looked upon as a good operation or to gratify a fancy; to ampu- tate through the condyles of the femur when an amputation at the knee-joint can be performed, or through the shaft of the femur when the like end may be secured by cutting through the condyles. The surgeon must ever look upon the operation of amputation as an unfortunate necessity, and should bear in mind that it is to be under- taken only to save or to prolong life, or to add to life’s usefulness. With these ends in view, he should not add one jot to its dangers, or take away an inch more of the body than is essential. The beauty of a stump may be something in itself, but is nothing if it is to be ob- tained by increased danger, and the brilliancy of an operation is a snare that should never be allowed to draw the surgeon avvay from the main object—the preservation of life—which alone gives the operation of amputation a high and scientific position in surgical practice. The mortality of amputation is more determined by age than any- thing else, and the credit of having statistically proved this fact is due to Mr. Holmes (c St. George’s Hosp. Rep.,’ 1866 and 1877). In my own paper on the causes of death in amputation (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xlii, 1859) this point was overlooked; but, following Mr. Holmes’s example, I re-analysed the cases on which it was based, and have been somewhat startled at the very definite conclusions brought out by my analysis. Thus— Out of 103 cases under 20 years of age, 10 died, or 1 in 10. Out of 111 cases between 21 and 40 years of age, 21 died, or 1 in 5. Out of 74 cases over 40 years of age, 22 died, or 1 in 3J. The mortality of amputation between the ages of 20 and 40 being exactly twice as great as before 20 years of age. Mr. Callender (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xlvii, 1864) and Mr. Holmes’s combined statistics reveal the same results: Cases under 20 years of age. Callender’s . 61 cases, 3 died Holmes’s . 130 „ 22 „ Between 20 and 40 years of age. 92 cases, 20 died 215 „ 68 „ Over 40 years of age. 74 cases, 30 died. 155 „ 68 „ 191 cases, 26 died, or 1 in 7$. 307 cases, 88 died, or 1 in 3^. 229 cases, 98 died, or 1 in 2J. Fifty-two deaths having occurred in 250 cases reported by Mr. Holmes in subjects under 30 years of age, and 106 deaths in 250 cases operated upon after 30 years of age. If the causes of amputation are looked at in the same light, the results become still more marked, for, dividing them into amputa- tions for disease, accident, and expediency, the latter term including amputations for tumours, deformity, &c., the following facts are elicited : Under 20 years of age Between 20 and 40 .

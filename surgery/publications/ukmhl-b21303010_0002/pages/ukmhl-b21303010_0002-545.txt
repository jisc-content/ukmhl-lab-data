TUMOURS OF BONE. 525 of slow growth and simple in its nature. In the case of a woman, set. 34, from which Fig. 588 was taken, the disease had existed for three years. Fig. 589 represents the same tumour taken during life. j1Q 587. Fig- 589. Fig.588- Appearance of limb affected with osteo- chondroma. eriosteal osteo-sarcoma. Drawing 20, Guy’s Hosp. Mus. Key’s case.

Myeloid tumours of hone are probably innocent, exceptional instances Myeloid being on record in which a return in the part or in internal organs tumours, took place. They usually attack also either the epiphyses or epi- physial ends of the shafts of hones (Fig. 590). I have seen the disease, however, involving the shaft of the radius and upper jaw, and Paget has described it as attacking the breast. It begins commonly in the centre of the bone which it ex- pands, forming a globular shell of bone, the spina ventosa of the older writers(Fig.591). The interior of this shell is made up of fibre-tissue, or, it may be cystic, tlie cavity being di- vided by means of fibrous septa into more or less well-marked cystic divi- sions.The spaces themselves,or loculi, contain the characteristic myeloid material, “an opaque white, inter- mixed with a semi-transparent gela- tinous-looking substance of a cherry- r red colour,” and their substance is from Tlie cystic form.

81 URINARY DEPOSITS. indicated from changes in the pigment or extractives, the acids being probably the lactic, acetic, and butyric. A drop of acid added to such urine will cause the settlement of the deposit (Fig. 329). Urates are dissolved by heat and alkalies. Uric acid appears in transparent urine of a yellow colour, and is Uric acid, usually deposited slowly.

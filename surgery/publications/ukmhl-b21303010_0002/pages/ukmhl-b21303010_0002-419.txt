399 FRACTURES OP THE RADIUS. may follow. I have seen such an arrest of growth in the humerus of a woman, to the extent of three and a half inches, after a fracture of fraclure_ the shaft which occurred when she was about eight years ot age (fig. 487). I have also recorded (‘ Guy’s Hosp. Rep.,’ 1862) a case, m which with a stiff shoulder-joint, the humerus was five inches shorter than its Fin. 487. Right humerus. Arrest of growth in the humerus after fracture Left humerus. in early life. fellow, in a woman ait. 30, the shortening having followed some injury to the upper part of the bone during infancy. In the first case, the arrest of growth was probably due to some injury to the nutrient artery of the hone, in the second, to injury to the epiphysial cartilage at the upper part of the shaft. Fractures of the hones of the forearm. These form about two fifths of all fractures, half the cases consisting Fractures of of fracture of the radius alone, a fourth of fracture of the ulna includ- the forearm, ing the olecranon process, and the remaining fourth of the two bones together ; fracture of the radius and ulna together being about equal in frequency to that of the clavicle. Fracture of the radius may take place at its head, neck, shaft, or Of the radius, lower end. When of the neck or shaft, and transverse, the fragments of bone are usually loose, yielding on manipulation a distinct crepitus, the head of the bone being felt not to rotate in its position; but, when the head of the bone is fissured longitudinally no such symptoms will be present. Fractures of the lower end of the bone are of a verv vari- able nature; a large number of them are impacted, the compact shaft of the bone being driven into the cancellated carpal extremity. When impaction does not exist, it is from comminution of the lower fragment.

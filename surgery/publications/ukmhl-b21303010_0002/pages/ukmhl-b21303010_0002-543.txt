523 TUMOURS OF BONES. Three of the cases tabulated were examples of multiple exostosis; when the radius was affected, it was in common with other bones. Enchondromatous or cartilaginous tumours of bone are most com- Enclion- monly met with in the phalanges and metacarpal bones. They are, droma. however, seen surrounding bones having a periosteal origin, or grow- ing from the bones of the’upper jaw. A remarkable instance of this has been recorded in Chapter XIII, and figured in Fig. 218. It would appear that such cartilaginous tumours are more prone to attack the scapula than any other bones, and I have seen several such cases. Mr. Birkett has recorded and figured a fine specimen in the ‘ Guy’s Reports,’ 1866. The bones of the pelvis are at times the seat of such growths. I Pelvis have the records of a remarkable instance in which the pelvic surface sometimes of the ilium was the seat of the affection, and of another in which a attacl<ed. Fig. 585.

They are generally covered by a shell of the bone in which they originate, the cartilage at times expand-

DIAGNOSIS OF ADENOCELE OF THE BREAST. 248 May increase are they readily to be distinguished and cause J J pressure. Fig. 396. Characters of adenocele. Adenocele a local affection. Diagnosis of tumour caused by partial or general enlargement of gland, See. But yet, if careful observations are taken, an error in diagnosis should not be made. For, although the breast itself may be much pressed on or even expan- ded over the tumour, it will still exist, and, on careful examination its presence, as a rule, will be made out. The nipple, although flattened from the extreme glandular ex- pansion, can still be seen (Fig. 397) ; and is rarely retracted. The integu- ments may be stretched to an extreme point, yet will they still be move- able and sound (Fig. 396), although some inflamma- tion from over-distension may have made its ap- pearance, and large veins are always to be observed meandering in the healthy tissue. The tumour, if solid, may appear ta- bulated (Fig. 397), and if containing cysts, fluctuation may be detected. Still, the disease is essentially a local one, and affects the patient through purely local condi- tions. It is to be treated only by ex- cision, and the gland, as a rule, should be left unharmed, the tu- mour being turned out of its capsule. In extreme examples, however, the breast is so stretched out as to be useless, and then must be removed. In the patient from which Fig. 397 was taken, this was the case. She was a woman, set. 35, and the tumour was of six years grow The diagnosis of a tumour which is evidently caused by some paitial or general enlargement or infiltration of the mammary gta^d.

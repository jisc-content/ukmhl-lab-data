EXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. 481 What ought that practice, then, to he ? Should it be excision or am- Question of putation ? Let us refer to facts to help us towards a solution of these points. I have a table of 294 cases of amputation of the thigh for chronic disease of the knee-joint, at various ages, and Mr. Mac Cormac tabulates 137, the total making 431. Of these, 96 died aud 335 Statistics of recovered, the mortality being 22 per cent., or 1 in 5. On referring °Pera 10n- to Dr. Hodges’ work, I find 178 cases of excision of the knee un- dertaken solely for chronic disease of the knee, of which 70 died, aud 108 recovered, the mortality of excision being 39 per cent., or 1 in 2£ cases. In this comparison, the circumstances are exactly similar; both operations being undertaken for chronic joint disease, and the mortality is exactly double. In my table of amputa- tions, I have carefully guarded against any fallacy, and have in- cluded only my own statistics,1 Mr. Callender’s,2 Mr. Mac Cor- inac’s,3 and Mr. Holmes’,4 all of which are equally indisput- able ; and in the table of excisions I have gone to Dr. Hodge’s work, who, to make this point certain states, that with three exceptions performed for acute inflammation of the articulation, excision of the knee has probably never been undertaken for any other than chronic disease or white swelling. Mr. Swain, the author of the Jacksonian Swain’s prize essay on “ Excision,” and a warm advocate of the operation, has given us statistics on this subject, and from his book (pp. 62 and tte kuee.° 64) I have extracted the following facts:—Up to 1865, there had been 316 cases of excision of the knee. Of this number 85 died, or 26'8 per cent.; 9 of these died after amputation which bad been performed in 39 cases after excision. Since 1865, 74 cases are given, 25 of which died from the operation, or 33'7 per cent.; 4 also died out of 11 that underwent subsequent amputation; in all, 29 cases out of the 74 died, or 39 per cent. Mr. Swain gives us also a select list of cases numbering 82, of which 15 died from the effects of the operation, while 4 others recovered after amputation. We have thus 472 cases of excision of the knee and 129 deaths, or 27‘3 Results of per cent., 13 of these being after amputation; 41 other cases underwent 47~ cases ?f amputation and recovered. Taking the whole number of 472 cases, 302, the knee? or 63-9 per cent, recovered after excision; 41, or 8'7 per cent, recovered after secondary amputation; 129, or 27’3 per cent., died after excision : the mortality from excision was thus greater than from amputation in the same class of cases, the relative proportion being 27 to 22 per ! cent. “ It is also,” adds Holmes, “ a somewhat suspicious feature in Mr. Swain’s table that all the 302 recoveries are claimed as being with ' useful limbs. If the information had been at all adequately full, there ; would surely have been a category of recoveries with the limb more or 1 less useless ; ” since it is a well-known fact that the utility of the limb i in many cases in which it seemed perfect at first becomes destroyed by subsequent changes. In childhood, suspension of growth is not an unfrequeut result, and, when the whole epiphyses are removed, it is io he looked for. It is true that Mr. Swain gives somewhat dif- Criticisms of ferent results from the same statistics, as he actually numbers amongst s"'a.m’8 the recoveries after excision, all cases that subsequently underwent am- statl8tics' putation, thus of course giving a far too favourable colouring to the operation he is advocating. 1 ‘ Med.-Cliir.

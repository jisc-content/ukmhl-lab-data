314 CLUB-FOOT. Club-foot. Its forms. Combina- tions. Stromeyer, however, in 1831, only followed Delpech in 1828, this great surgeon, following a greater—John Hunter—who in 1794 esta- blished the principle of subcutaneous surgery, when he divided injuries to sound parts into two divisions, and established this principle, that—“ The injuries of the first division, in which the parts do not com- municate externally, seldom inflame, while those of the second com- monly both inflame and suppurate.” Club-foot may he divided into four typical forms :— Talipes equinus, in which the heel is simply drawn up by the con- traction of the muscles of the calf (Fig. 420). Fig. 420. Talipes varus, in which the foot is drawn inwards to different de- grees (Fig. 421). Talipes valgus, in which the foot is turned out (Fig. 422). And, talipes calcaneus, in which the foot is drawn up and the heel depressed (Fig. 423). Combinations of these forms are commonly seen, thus, we have T. equino-varus, when the foot is turned in and heel drawn up (Fig. 421a) ; T. equino-valgus, when the foot is turned out and the heel drawn up; T. caleaneo-varus and calcaneo valgus being terms applied when the heel is depressed and foot turned in or out. Talipes varus is the usual congenital form, but any may exist, talipes Fig. 421. Congenital Varus. equinus and equino-varus and valgus being the more common acquired forms.

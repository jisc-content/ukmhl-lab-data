The skin is at first dimpled, then puck- ered, and at last infil- trated. The breast also, from being a moveable organ, be- comes fixed; so fixed, indeed, that it cannot be separated from the pectoral muscle. This form of cancer is the more common. The disease may ap- pear in one lobe or in all, and be slow in its progress or rapid, but in every case its pro- gress is much alike; generally, however, this infiltrating form of cancer assumes the characters of the tuberous. In Figs. 399,400 these changes are clearly shown. Fig. 400. Tuberous caucer commences as a circumscribed indepen- dent growth within the gland structure, with a well-defined capsule separating but not in- filtrating the tissues. Some- times two or more tubers ap- pear together, and these may at last coalesce. This form, unlike the infiltrating does not contract, but grows in all directions, involving all the parts which it touches, push- ing the breast to one side, or drawing it to itself (Fig. 401). It often attains a large size, giving rise to an irregular lobulated tumour. It is at times soft in consistence, when it is called medullary can- cer ; when firm, it is known Infiltrating cancer with puckered integument, as fibrous; when jelly-like, From model.

DISLOCATIONS OP THE ANKLE-JOINT. 363 When the force is continued or more severe, the fibula may be made to project through an external wound; and in still more severe cases, the fractured or rather exposed ends of both tibia and fibula. I have Fig. 465. Fig. 466. External appearances of foot in Pott’s fracture. Taken from Pott’s work. A. P. Cooper.

I simply reduced the dislocation after washing the wound, and fixed it in splints. Dislocation of the foot backwards (Fig. 467). Sir A. Cooper called this Dislocation dislocation of the tibia and fibula for- wards. It is usually caused by the violent propulsion of the lower end of the leg bones forwards, when the foot is fixed, and is readily recognised by the shortening of the anterior surface of the foot and the proportionate elonga- tion of the heel, with some pointing of the toes, as well as prominence of the lower end of the tibia. At times, the fibula is fractured and the point of bone carried backwards with the astra- galus. This accident is rare, it being more common to meet with fracture of both malleoli, and displacement of the foot and broken fragments back- wards. In 1862,1 was called to treat a very marked case of this kind in a man, set. 32. The astragalus with the foot seemed to have been shot completely out of its socket, and the extremities of foot Fig. 467. backwards. Causes.

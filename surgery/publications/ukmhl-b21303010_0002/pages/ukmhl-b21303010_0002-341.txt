ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY. 322 The case was that of a boy, set. 12, who was born with talipes Example, equino-varus of the right foot, and went under surgical treatment when eight months, and again when five years old, but with no permanent relief. On admission into Guy's, under my care, on June 12th, 1878, the heel of the right foot was much drawn up, and the foot so twisted inwards as to cause the sole of the foot to face the median line of the body, as in a complete subastragaloid dislocation.

By no force could the foot be restored to a better position, although the tendo-Acliillis and tendon of the posterior tibial muscles could be made tense. Under the circumstances described it was tolerably clear that by no tenotomy or mechanical means could any hope be entertained of restoring the foot to a good position, and I consequently determined to perforin Mr. Davies-Colley’s operation. This I did on June 18th, 1878, by an oblique T-incision of the soft lucision parts, and the application of a keyhole saw beneath the tendons and soft made, parts, made after Esmarch bandages had been applied as a tourniquet. The wedge of bone I removed is represented in Fig; 427c, and was Bones taken out entire, great care being taken to protect the tendons and removed, soft tissues and particularly those of the sole, by the introduction of a flat retractor, during the sawing process. The day following the operation the temperature went up to 102-4°, but fell the next day. On the third day, when the wound was dressed for the first time, it was 99’6°, and during the progress of the case it

DISLOCATIONS OF THE HUMERUS. 337 Snbcoracoid.—This is probably the most common form of dislocation, but the statistics I have given place it second on the list. Flower has shown, however (‘ Path. Soc.,’ vol. xii) that 31 out of the 41 specimens of dislocation of the shoulder-joint found in the London Museums belong to the subcoracoid class. In it the head of the humerus rests on the anterior lip of the glenoid cavity beneath the coracoid process, or even more forwards, the completeness of this dislocation turning upon the Fig. 434 Sulylenoid From Mr. Flower’s models, Middlesex Hosp.

When they are completely torn through at their insertion into the great tuberosity of the humerus, or the tuberosity is torn off, the head of the hone will he more forward than when they are only stretched or partially divided. Many of the cases described by Sir A. Cooper as dislocation downwards, or as partial dislocation, were doubtless of this kind; and many others re- corded as examples of subcla- vicular, are nothing more than specimens of this variety. (Fig. 434.) Symptoms.—The symptoms of this form of dislocation in their general character are the same as in most others, such as inabi- lity to move the arm, immobility and pain often passing down some nerve trunk, and aggra- vated by movement. On look- ing at the part and comparing the injured with the sound side before swelling has appeared, some striking points will be ob- served, such as flattening of the deltoid, prominence of the acro- mion, and a depression beneath it.

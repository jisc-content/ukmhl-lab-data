420 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Back’s method by weights. Cripps’ splint- fails to fulfil the objects the surgeon has in view. It is daily dropping out of use. Gurdon Buck’s method of applying extension to the limb by means of weights has found great favour of late years, and is doubtless very good and simple, the counter-extending force being applied by means of a perineal band of india-rubber tubing fastened to the head of the bedstead or splint, while the limb is steadied by means of long sand bags applied laterally, or short thigh splints. This plan, how- ever, has the disadvantage of not preserving sufficient immobility of the broken bones, and ought, therefore, only to be employed in con- junction with the long splint. A very excellent splint has been suggested by Mr. Cripps, in which extension and counter-extension are kept up by a carefully regulated elastic force, and I have used it with great advantage. The perineal pad, however, must be a thick and yet a soft one. The whole thing is figured below (Fig. 513). I prefer, however, the double splint (Fig. 507). Fig 513.

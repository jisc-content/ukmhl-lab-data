(Fig. 347), or rectangular, must he regarded as a director. It is a means the surgeon employs to guide his knife into the bladder, and I may say with Key, that “ the advantage of a straight over a curved line as a conductor to a cuttiug instrument is too obvious to require any comment. Is it surprising that the blind should err in a crooked path ?” Key’s staff is blunt-pointed as a sound, and more deeply grooved than the common staff, to prevent any risk of the knife slip- ping out; the grove is in the centre of the staff, not at one side as in the ordinary curved one, and it runs to within half an inch of the end. “ Its chief superiority,” writes Key, “ consists in allowing the surgeon to turn the grove in any direction he may wish.” The staff must vary in length and size according to the age of the patient and size of the urethra, it being well to use as large a one as will pass readily down the urethra. The knife varies much with the fancy of the operator.

LITHOTOMY. 115 hold that instrument in his left hand, nearly perpendicularly with the Fergusson’s concavity of the curve touching the upper part of the triangular liga- ment, and to draw the scrotum slightly upwards and a little to the right side with his right hand, while he stands on the patient’s right side. Then the surgeon should seat himself in front of the perinseum, having previously arranged with an assistant about having the instru- ments handed to him, or having already assorted them properly in a chair at his side. Now it may be well to pass the forefinger of the left hand, oiled, into the rectum to ascertain the size of the prostate, and also the depth of this organ from the surface; next, having with- drawn his finger, he should trace the course of the ramus of the pubes and ischium on the left side, ascertain the position of the tuberosity of the latter bone on each side, and having scanned the whole surface, should proceed to use the knife, holding it as he would a scalpel or bistoury as represented in Fig. 352. The point of the blade should be entered about one inch and three fourths in front of the anus, about a line’s breadth left of the raphe, pushed through the skin and carried by a kind of sawing motion down the left side of the perinaeum, about an inch and a quarter beyond the anus, the middle of the incision being at equal distances from the latter part and the tuberosity; next the blade should run along the surface of the exposed fat and cellular tissue, and then the point of the forefinger of the left hand should be thrust into the wound a little in front of the anus, so as to penetrate between the accelerator urin® and the erector penis muscles, the knife being applied to any part which offers resistance, when, with a little ;orce to separate the tissues, the top of the finger can be placed upon the membranous portion of the urethra, and the groove in the staff may be distinctly felt. The point of the blade, with the flat surfaces nearly horizontal (Fig. 352), should now be carried along above the inger, made to perforate the urethra about three lines in front of the prostate, and then be slid along the groove until it has entered the bladder, having slit open the side of the urethra and notched the mar- gin of the prostate in its course. If the stone is supposed to be of sonsiderable magnitude the blade should, in withdrawing it, be carried i little out of the groove so as to increase the incision of the prostate. The forefinger of the left hand should next be slipped slowly into the fladder along the staff, in such a manner as to cause dilatation of the mrrounding textures, and its point should be moved about in search of he stone, which being found should be retained in a position near the teck of the viscus; then the assistant should be desired to remove the taff, and the surgeon should introduce the forceps along the upper urfaee of the finger, slowly withdrawing the latter as the former nakes progress; their entrance will be denoted by a gush of urine, at finch instant the blades should be separated, when on gently approxi- mating them the stone will, in all probability, be felt enclosed; if it s not, the process may be repeated if the water still flows, but should he bladder now be empty the closed blades should be quietly moved bout the bladder until the stone is touched, and at this time, in open- lg and closing them, great care should be taken to avoid auy injury j the bladder. To make sure that the membrane has not been grasped ; is well to move the forceps a little before commencing extraction, hen, if all is right, the process should be effected by a slow zigzag lovement in a direction towards the floor, and with a slight pulling

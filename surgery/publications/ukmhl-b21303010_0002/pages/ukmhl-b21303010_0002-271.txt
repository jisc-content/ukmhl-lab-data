CANCER OF THE BREAST. 253 strongest. In a general way, a cancer runs its course in two or three years; though sometimes it is most chronic in its action. To illustrate some of the points connected with this subject the following analysis of 400 cases may he of value. The cases are taken from my own notes; 180 occurred in Guy’s during the period of my registrarship many years ago, and 220 are from my own case- book since. The disease made its first appearance— In 17 cases, or 4 per cent., under 30 years of age. In 108 „ or 27 per cent., between 31 and 40 years of age. In 144 „ „ 36 „ „ 41 „ 50 „ In 101 „ „ 25 „ „ 51 „ 60 In 29 „ „ 7 „ „ 61 „ 70 „ In 1 over 70 years of age. I have, however, seen a case of cancer of the breast in a patient aged 28, and one of a year’s standing in the breast of an old lady set. 96. Age when disease appeared. Of these 313 were married, 77 were single, and 10 were widows. Social Of the 313 married, 235 were prolific and 78 sterile. A large cond'tion- proportion of the prolific women were so to an extreme degree, ten and Prolific or more children being a common note to find recorded. Married women sterile, and those in whom the gland has been the most active, are apparently more liable to cancer of the breast than the single when the period of gland activity has passed. 194 of these examples were in the right breast, 187 in the left, and side affected. 19 in both. In 140 the disease had existed a year or less. Duration of disease. In 99 between 1 and 2 years. In 13 between 4 and 5 years In 23 ,, 2 „ 3 „ In 9 „ 5 „ 7 „ In 15 „ 3 „ 4 ■„ In 6 „ 8 „ 9 „ In four cases, the disease had existed ten, twelve, fourteen and twenty years respectively, and the form of cancer in these of long standing was the atrophic. With respect to any hereditary history of cancer in the 400 Hereditary cases, although carefully inquired into, I found it to exist in only 47 history, or nearly 12 per cent.; and, in 35 of these cancer was reported to have occurred in one member, in 11 in two members, and in one in three. In 7 of the 47 cases the relative was on the father’s side, in 23 on the mother’s, and in 7 it was found among the brothers or sisters. In 5, it bad attacked the aunts, in 3, cousins, and in 1 a grandmother, although in these the point was not stated respecting the paternal or maternal relation. These facts are enough to indicate that where an hereditary tendency exists, it is more powerful on the mother’s than the father’s side. In a large proportion of the cases in which an hereditary history of cancer was traced, the cancer was of the breast. A section of an infiltrating cancer is well shown in Fig. 402. A section of the tuberous form in Fig. 403. For the microscopical appearances of cancer vide Fig. 32. Colloid or alveolar cancer is occasionally seen in the mamma, although On colloid in a clinical point of view the growth presents no such features as to cancer enable the surgeon to recognise its presence.

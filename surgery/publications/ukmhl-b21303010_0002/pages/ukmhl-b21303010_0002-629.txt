AFFECTIONS OF STUMPS. 609 Stumps, and their Morbid Conditions. To secure a good stump is desirable, although to obtain it by taking Slumps an.! away more of the body than is required by the exigence of the case, no mor,,il1 increased risk to life should be incurred. Many of the most promisiug stumps after an amputation often turn out badly, while the least promis- ing end well; the result depending more probably on their subsequent dressing than on the condition of the flaps at the time, it being quite certain that bad dressing may destroy the best stumps and good dress- Importance ing improve the bad. Still, the character of the stump is much deter- Hl K0!11* mined by the form of amputation that has been performed. The stump after a circular amputation (Fig 639) is not so good as that obtained after a flap (Fig. 640). The stump left after the mixed form of dressing. Fig. 639. Fig. 640. Thigh stump after a circular amputa- tion of thigh. After a flap. amputation of the leg, leaves nothing to be desired (Fig 617), and that which is met with after amputation at the knee-joint when the patella is left is unexceptionable (Fig 641). A conical stump (Fig 642) is always regarded as a bad one, and yet CouicM most thigh and arm (single bone) stumps after primary amputation smmps. Fig. 641. Fig. 642. Stump after amputation at the knee-joint Conical stump become conical by time, the soft parts and muscles wasting, except in very fat subjects. When double bones exist, this evil is rarely seen nor is it after amputations at the joints. Knee and elbow stumps and Pirogoffâ€™s are the best we see. ^ VOL. II. 39

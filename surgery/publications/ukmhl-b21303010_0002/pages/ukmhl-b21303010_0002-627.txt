pirogoff’s amputation. 607 Fig. 635. Tn Syme’s first operation, in 1842 (‘Observations in Clinical Surgery/ 1861), he simply took away the malleolar projections and did not remove the articulating surface of the tibia as subsequently advised, and it is still an open question whether any advantage is gained by this extra section of boue. I have performed this operation by Syme’s original method, with an excellent result. The stump following the amputation is excellent. Fig 635, taken from Fergusson’s lectures on the progress of surgery, illustrates it admirably:—“ The very bit of -soft material on which we naturally stand is still preserved for the future basis of this support.” Some surgeons, and Pirrie amongst them, per- form the operation by sawing through the tibia and fibula without disarticulating the foot. The modi- fication is good. Roux’s amputation differs from Syme’s only in the flap being made from the inner and under side of the heel. I have on one occasion made a long an- terior flap—the only one the condition of the parts permitted, with success. Pirogoff’3 Amputation. Stump after Syme’s amputation, from Vergusson. Pirrie’s modification. Roux’s method. This operation is to be regarded as a modification of Syme’s, and was introduced by its distinguished originator during the Crimean war. The merit he claims for it is the novel osteo-plastic pjr0g0irs principle that, a portion of one bone remaining, naturally connected amputation, with soft parts, readily unites with another, and, at the same time Fig. 636. Pirogoff’s amputation. Heel flap with calcis. serves to lengthen the limb and increase its utility. It differs from Syme’s in leaving the tuberosity of the os calcis in the heel flap instead of dissecting it out, and bringing up its exposed cut surface to unite to the divided extremities of the tibia and fibula. I have frequentlv performed it, and in every instance with a good result. Busk was the first surgeon who did it in this country, in 1857.

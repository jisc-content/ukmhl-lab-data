615 INVALID LIFT. putting the other end of the iron rod, which has a collar on it, into the opposite stretcher pole; then pass the other iron rod under the feet of the patient in the same manner. Fig. 649. Iuvalid lift as made at 237, Euston Road. N.W. Pass the linen hands gently under the patient, where he is best able to hear pressure, the broad band under the shoulders and the two narrowest bands one at each end of the stretcher poles, at the same time placing the eyelet holes over the pins on each side of the stretcher poles. Tighten the linen bands by turning the iron rods with the key, thus when necessary making the stretcher perfectly rigid. Place the uprights marked No. 1 at the head of the bedstead, on the mattress or palliasse, with the number facing the foot of the bedstead ; next place the iron shoe marked No. 1 on the square end of the upright; the handle end of the pole will now rest on the bedstead and support the uprights at the head till you put up the uprights marked No. 2 at the feet, with the number towards you in the same manner, when the whole will remain firm. Each lift is marked according to these in- structions. Place the remaining pieces of wood or bases at the head and foot (on the mattress when a feather bed is used), dropping the uprights into the holes cut in the bases to receive them. If the patient lies on the mattress, then place the bases on the palliasse, so that in either case the bed or mattress can he removed and shaken and the bed made comfortably whilst the patient is suspended above. Slip the ends of the webbing attached to the long pole over the ends of the stretcher, put on the handle, and lift your patient gently by turning it to the right, and when up the required height, place the loop of webbing which is on your right hand securely over the end of the handle, when the patient will remain suspended. Take care not to let the handle slip while raising or lowering the patient.

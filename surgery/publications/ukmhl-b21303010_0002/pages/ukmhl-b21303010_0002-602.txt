AMPUTATION. 582 sponge, either of these materials forming a firm elastic compress which keeps the flaps well in apposition, and checks bleeding, due care being taken to keep the end of the drainage tube exposed. To seal a wound completely and not to leave a drainage opening must always be re- garded as bad practice. With well-adjusted flaps, good drainage, and rest, as secured by the application of a splint, most stumps may be expected to do well. Dressing The stump may be raised, as in Fig. 611, for the first day after the stump. operation, but subsequently placed in a horizontal position. It should not be dressed for three or four days unless it becomes uncomfortable or the discharge offensive, for the less the parts are disturbed during the early days the better, repair going on much more satisfactorily when left alone than when the dressings are too frequently changed. To dress a stump, the trough, water-can, and tube, as illustrated in Fig. 613, are to be recommended. Fig. 613. Trough and water-can for dressing slump.

Removal of The stitches may be taken away on the third or fourth day, when sutures. the parts should be supported by strapping if they gape, or if union is

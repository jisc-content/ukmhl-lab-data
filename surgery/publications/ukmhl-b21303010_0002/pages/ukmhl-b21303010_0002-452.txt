432 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Treatment. Treatment.—It is wise, in fracture of the leg, as of other hones, to “ set ” the fracture and to put the injured limb into the right position with good splints as soon as possible. In a general way, for fractures of the lower two thirds of the bones, the best apparatus is a straight, flat, and not too broad, metal or wooden posterior splint (Fig. 528), with a rectangular foot-piece and two broad lateral splints (Fig. 529), all being well padded and firmly Fig. 529. fixed by broad strips of strapping, broad bands of inelastic webbing or bandages, the seat of fracture being left exposed, if possible, for Fig. 630. MacIntyre’s splint and Salter’s swing.

418 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. ing of the trochanter (fig. 511). Similar instances have also been published by Dr. Boddick, of Montreal (‘Canada Med. and Surg. Journal/ Nov., 1875), and Mr. McCarthy (‘ Path. Trans./ 1874). ° Fig. BIO. Fig. 511. Mr. Aston Key’s case. Appearance during life, l’rep. 1196, Guy’s Mus. Mr. Poland’s case.

This may take place in any part, but is more common in the centre than elsewhere, and, as a consequence, of indirect violence; it may occur, however, as a result of direct force, and more rarely of muscular action. From this cause I have seen it from the swinging of the limb over the side of a cart in the act of descending, and, in an epileptic patient, from the spasm of the muscles, with the patient in bed. I have known it also to take place from the same cause when cancer of the bone existed. The fracture may be transverse, oblique in any direction, dentated, comminuted or impacted, the nature of the force and its direction determining these points; a sharp blow is likely to be followed by a transverse fracture; a crushing force by a comminuted one; an in- direct fracture probably will be oblique, according to the natural bend in the lower part of the limb. In the middle of the bone, a lateral obliquity is the most common, in the lower third, an obliquity from behind forwards. Fractures may also be double in the same bone or compound. In the case illustrated (Fig. 512) the fracture was im- Fig. 512. Impacted fracture of the shaft of the femur produced by a fall upon the knee in a man, aged 83.

When, however, the forearm and elbow-joint are hopelessly injured, gangrenous, or diseased, amputation may be demanded, and, therefore,â€™ as the very worst cases are included in this category, the mortality of the operation is great, viz. one in three for injuries, and one in ten for disease. Fig. 619. Amputation of arm by flap operation. The flap operation, as already described, is the best in this region, the anterior flap being made by cutting from without inwards, towards the bone, excluding the brachial artery, and the posterior by transfixing all that remains.

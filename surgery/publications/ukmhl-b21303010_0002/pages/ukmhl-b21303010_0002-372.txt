DISLOCATIONS OP THE HIP-JOINT. 352 Condition of round ligament. Analysis of cases. Dislocation on tlie dorsum. dorsum ilii or towards tlio sciatic notch is due to the amount of flexion Fig. 454.

Also that the degree of flexion and rotation of the limb inwards determines in any particular instance whether the dislocation shall be dorsal or ischiatic, the latter variety occurring when flexion is carried to an extreme. Direct dorsal dislocation can only be produced by immense violence and is often complicated with fracture of the acetabulum. In all cases, the round ligament and capsule are torn across, the muscles about the joint being more or less lacerated. The following analysis shows many of these points:— Out of 54 consecutive cases which have occur- red at Guy’s and in my own practice, 27 were on the dorsum, 12 into the foramen ovale, 8 into the sciatic notch, and 7 on the os pubis. Eleven occurred in subjects under 20 years of age, the youngest being 6; and 28 between the ages of 21 and 40; while 15 had passed that period. Forty-six were in the male, and 8 in the female sex. Dislocation on the dorsum ilii, or backwards and upwards, forms about half of all the cases of dislocation at this joint, and is usually produced by some twisting movement of the body or limb Dislocation backwards, on the dorsum.

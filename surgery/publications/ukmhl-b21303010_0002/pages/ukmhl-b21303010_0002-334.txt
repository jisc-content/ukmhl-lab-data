ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY. 316 How repair of tendons takes place. Pig. 421a. based, and the process by which repair can take place after the di- vision of tendon. To Paget and W. Adams, in this country, we are chiefly indebted for our knowledge of this subject, and I shall use as much as pos- sible, Adams’ description of this process as published in 1860, in his work on the ‘ Repara- tive Process of Human Tendons after Division,’ his investigations having confirmed those of the former as well as added to our stock of knowledge. When such a tendon as the tendo Achillis is divided subcutaneously, the divided ends sepa- rate, in an infant for half an inch, and in an adult from one to two inches, the degree depending much upon the healthy condition of the divided muscle and the amount of move- ment subsequently permitted in the ankle-joint. The reparative process begins by increased vascularity in the sheath of the tendon, which is followed by the infiltration of a blastematous material into its meshes or spaces between its fibrous elements, exhibiting the development of innumerable small Fig. 422. nuclei, a few cells of large size and irregular form, with granular contents,or, perhaps, with Fig. 423. one or more nuclei and studded with minute molecules of oil; a blaste- matous material, in which the cell forms do not develope beyond the stage of nuclei, appearing to be the proper reparative material from which new ConcfenilaZ tendon is developed. This Acquired Talipes Calcaneus nucleated blastema soon becomes vascular, capil- lary vessels having been seen in it on the eighteenth day; the nuclei assume an elongated, spindle, or oat-shaped form, and are seen after

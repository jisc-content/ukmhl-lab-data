TUMOURS OF BONE. 528 Periosteal form. Endosteal form. Epithelial cancer. Subsequent to necrosis. cancer, masses of bone of a condensed kind appear in the medulla, and gradually grow until a large osseous mass of disease is formed. In Fig. 594 this form of disease is well seen, and was taken from a patient of Mr. Aston Keyâ€™s, set. 26, in whom masses of hone and cartilaginous tubercles were found in the lungs, pleura, and lymphatic glands after death. The periosteal form of cancer (Fig. 593) grows more rapidly than the endosteal or interstitial, and very quickly assumes a large size; and is not often accompanied by pain; the swelling is rarely globular in its outline, but loses itself both above and below in the surrounding parts; and in the integument covering it large full veins, from ob- struction to the deep veins will likewise be seen. It will possess a semi-elastic feel, and often yield to the touch an unequal sensation as to density. Endosteal cancer is commonly attended with a dull aching pain, due to the expansion of the bone. Its increase is at first slow, but when it has so destroyed the bone as to have reached the periosteum, pain will be lessened, while the increase of the tumour Fig. 595. Cancer attaching necrosed tibia. will be more rapid. This form of cancer is more frequently secondary than primary. Primary cancer of bone or periosteum is more common in children than in adults. Epithelial cancer may attack a bone by the extension of the disease from the soft parts, as seen in cancer of the lips; and skin cancer may Fig. 596. also extend downwards into a bone of an extremity and cause great destruction. At times, a bone that has been the subject of necrosis may

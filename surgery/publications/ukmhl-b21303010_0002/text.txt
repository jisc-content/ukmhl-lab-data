SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. Wounds. Incised and lacerated wounds of the nose generally progress well on Wounds, account of the freedom of its vascular supply. The edges of any wound should consequently be brought carefully together and fixed with sutures, even if the part be nearly separated from the body. For this purpose very fine silk ought to be used, and great care exercised in the accurate adjustment of the parts—a suture being passed through the cartilages when they have been divided. In the case illustrated in Fig. 298, where the nose was nearly cut off, the edges of the wound were adjusted, and a good recovery followed. This case occurred in the practice of my lamented late colleague, Mr. Poland. Fracture of the Nose. This accident is not uncommon, and may be simple or compound. Fracture of It may likewise be followed by little or great deformity, the amount nasa’ ’’ones, depending much upon the care and skill with which the broken bones are readjusted. When little or no displacement exists, nothing else is required than the application of cold-water dressing, or perhaps ice, for the first few hours as these bones rapidly re-unite. When dis- placement has taken place, the surgeon must restore the misplaced bones by external manipulation, aided by pressure applied from within the nasal cavity by means of the blades of the ordinary dressing for- ceps, a probe, or some similar instrument as a female catheter. When the parts have been restored to their natural position, or as nearly so as is possible, care must be observed that no external pressure is em- ployed by which they can be displaced. Plugging of the nostrils is useless. When the force has been severe and direct upon the nose, fracture of the skull may complicate the case—fracture either of the Complicated ethmoid bone forming the floor of the base of the skull, as has been )vith illustrated in the chapter on injuries of the skull (Fig. 67), or fracture the^kull of the frontal bone. This latter form may be generally recognised by Fracture of the swelling and crepitation of emphysema about the forehead, or the frontal siuus.SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. q Dislocation of cartilages of nose. Displacement of septum. Adams’s operation. Epistaxis. Treatment. crepitus of the fracture with displacement, &c. Cases of fracture of the frontal sinus require no special treatment, and generally do well. In children, the cartilage of the I'm. 298. nose may be displaced from the nasal bones in consequence of an injury, and, unless replaced, permanent de- formity and obstruction will ensue. The surgeon consequently, when this accident takes place, should do his best to restore the misplaced parts and to keep them in apposition, al- though some difficulty is often expe- rienced in its accomplishment. With the view of preventing or correcting deformity Mr. W. Adams has suggested, that the broken or bent septum should be straightened by strong plate - bladed forceps (Fig. 298a b) and the broken nasal bones raised, these parts subsequently being maintained in position by an ivory clamp, and the side of the nose pressed into place by a nose truss (Fig. 298a a) connected with a fore- head plate (a) and band (b). The plates (e) are shaped according to the outline of the nose, and are made to diverge by rotating a central controlling screw, the pressure of the Fig 298o plates being regulated by two cir- cular springs. The ivory clamp must be worn day and night for three or four days after the defor- mity has been corrected, and the nose truss for some months during the day. Epistaxis. Bleeding from the nose is an occurrence of considerable fre- quency, and when not too free or lasting, rarely requires surgical in- terference. It may be the result of an injury—traumatic; or associated with some cancerous affection or fibrous growth from the base of the skull or other local cause; or, it may be the direct consequence of some fulness of the vessels of the head or heart disease. It is found also as a kind of passive exudatiou Forceps and nose truss for treatment of in anaunic and cachectic subjects; deformed nose. after purpura or from hepatic dis- ease, and also as supplementary to the catamenia. Treatment.—In order to successful treatment its cause must be ascertained. When traumatic, it usually stops without aid. WhenEPISTAXIS, WITH ITS TREATMENT. 3 due to plethora of the vessels from any cause, it is often salutary, and should be checked only when too copious or lasting. When of a passive General, nature it is serious, since anaemic feeble subjects cannot bear loss of blood, and the loss tends to aggravateits cause. In one case, therefore, saline purgatives may he of value; in another, iron in full doses, or gallic acid in gr. v or gr. x doses. As to its treatment no definite rules can he laid down, it being a common accompaniment of so many different conditions, local and general. When, however, life is threatened by its severity, real or comparative, Local, the surgeon is hound to interfere. The head should be kept raised, and cold applied to the nose and frontal sinuses by means of ice when it can he obtained, as also to the nape of the neck being often serviceable. A steady stream of some cool saline liquid (a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda and common salt to a pint of water being as good as any), passed through the nostril, is a very effectual mode of treatment. For this purpose, the double-action india-rubber enema apparatus with a nose- piece to introduce into the nostril may be employed; or Dr. Rasch’s vaginal syphon douche, applied as in Fig. 299, the patient breathing at Douche. Fig. 299. the time through the mouth, which should he kept wide open; Pro- fessor Weber, of Halle, having discovered, years ago, that while the patient is breathing through the mouth, the soft palate completely closes the posterior nares, and does not permit any fluid to pass into the pharynx. The popular methods of placing the patient in the erect posture, and raising both arms above the head, may likewise be tried4 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. Plugging. Mode of plugging. as they are unquestionably good. If these measures fail, the nostril or nostrils must be plugged. Plugging nose.—To do this effectually, some skill is necessary; to do it otherwise, is useless, if not injurious. To plug from the anterior nares alone is to trifle with the haemorrhage.andmerely to mask the escape of blood as well as to direct it down the pharynx, under which circum- stances, severe loss of blood may take place without knowledge. To per- form the operation of plugging effectually, a plug of lint, cotton wool, a sponge tent, or compressed sponge an inch and a quarter long and an inch wide, should be prepared and fastened in the middle by a piece of strong silk or whipcord, an end about six or nine inches long being left. Fig. 300. Bellocq’s canula for plugging nostrils. With Bellocq’s canula (Fig. 300), a long-eyed probe, or an elastic cathe- ter, a double thread of the same strong material should be passed into tbe nose along its floor through the posterior nares into the pharynx, and the loop caught either by the fingers or forceps and held while the in- strument is withdrawn through the nostril. There will then be the loop hanging out of the mouth, and the two ends out of the nostril. The loop must then be fastened firmly to the pledget that has been prepared. This plug having been well oiled, is then to be drawn into the mouth by applying traction upon the ligatures protruding from the nostril, tilted with the finger behind and above the soft palate, and carefully adjusted or wedged into the posterior nares ; by which means the escape of blood into the pharynx will be prevented. The two cords hanging from the anterior nares can then to be separated, and the nasal cavity filled with compressed sponge, lint, or cotton wool which should be introduced between them, the whole mass being made secure by tying the two cords across the plug that has been introduced in front, and fastening them in a bow to allow of unfastening. When any styptic is deemed necessary, the sponge, cotton wool, or lint intro- duced into the anterior nares may be saturated with the solution of the perchloride of iron, tannin, matico, or a concentrated solution of alum. By this means the possibility of any escape of blood from either opening of the nose can be effectually prevented, and the most dangerous epistaxis absolutely controlled. Sir W. Fergusson once remarked that he had known after plugging the nares, blood to ooze up along the nasal duct out of the caualiculi, but such “ oozing tears of blood” must be very rare. To remove the apparatus, the knot at the anterior nares should be undone and the anterior plug taken out, the posterior being readily drawn from its position by means of the endLIPOMA—LUPUS. 5 attached to it in the pharynx; this end, which need not be more than six inches, may be left hanging down the patient’s throat. The plug should not be left in more than three or four days, but may be re- introduced if necessary, the surgeon taking care to preserve in sitii, the two pieces of cord that have been passed along the floor of the nose. Lipoma, or Hypertrophy of the nose is a readily recognisable affection, and is a disease of the Lipoma, skin and subcutaneous tissue (not of the cartilages), in which the fol- licles freely participate. It is confined to the apex and alse of the organ. The enlargement is sometimes general, at others, the swellings are pen- dulous, lobulated, and loose. The capillaries of the part are sometimes congested, giving the growth a purplish hue. As a rule, it is pain- less, and causes only mechanical annoyance. It interferes at times with vision and the functions of the nose, and, moreover, wounds vanity. Nothing but the removal of the growth can be suggested, which can Treatment, be done without danger and with no great difficulty. The redundant mass is to be dissected oft', care being observed not to encroach upon the nostril. This is best done by introducing the little finger or a spatula into the nostril, and shaving the redundant mass off the cartilage with a scalpel. Any bleeding taking place can usually be checked by cold, styptics, or torsion ; the wound that is left being allowed to granulate. The surgeon, however, should not take away too much or go too deep; and some covering to the cartilages should be left. The disease rarely returns. The late Mr. Hey, of Leeds, was the first to perform the operation. Lupus. This affection is more common on the nose than in any other part of the Lupus body, and is often very destructive; so much so, indeed, as to destroy the exedens. whole organ. It is, however, more amenable to treatment than is usually supposed. Too often it is described as a strumous, and therefore con- stitutional affection, and regarded as incurable. It would be well however if surgeons would practically regard it more as a local one. The best local treatment in severe cases is the scraping away of Treatment. Pig. 301. Fig. 302.

From life.6 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. the diseased surface with a blunt knife or the handle of a scalpel, fol- lowed by the free cauterisation of the exposed surface; although in exceptional cases, excision may be performed. In milder forms, caustics are applicable, the potassa l'usa being the best, dissolved in equal parts of water. The galvano-caustic or thermo-cautery is, however, superior to any. One of the worst cases of lupus of the nose that I have seen was that illustrated by Fig. 301. It had existed for years, and was cured in a month, after one free application of the galvanic cautery, every ulcerating tubercle of unhealthy tissue being freely destroyed. No caustic treatment, however, should be employed as long as the parts are inflamed. Tonic treatment also, must not be neglected; while as a palliative application, cod-liver oil is very beneficial. Arsenic is also highly com- mended by Messrs. Hunt and others, and Donovan’s solution when there is any syphilitic taint. Lupus The lupus non-exedens may be regarded as an early stage of the lupus non-exedens. Gxe(|elis. both have a papular origin and become tubercular—the tuber- cles ulcerating at a later stage. Epithelial Epithelial cancer and rodent cancer cancer. may attack the nose, the former usually appearing at first as a warty growth which subsequently ulcerates; the latter as a firm, uncoloured, solitary nodule, which excoriates, then scales and bleeds, and finally ulcerates, deepening and extending the scabbed excoriation. In the epithelial cancer, the margin of the sore is more irregular and thicker than in the rodent ulcer, although until the lymph glands are affected it is somewhat difficult to distinguish between the two. Indeed, the epi- thelial cancer may be for long undistinguishable from the rodent cancer. The treatment of both, however, consists in the total destruction of the ulcerating surface and its edges, by cautery, escharotics, or the knife. I have treated many of the epithelial forms by means of the galvanic cautery with gratifying success. The disease, like other cancers, is, however, liable to return. Rhinoscopy. Rhinoscopy. The examination of the nasal cavity may be made through the nos- trils by means of a speculum, or through the posterior nares by means of a mirror introduced behind the soft palate after the same fashion as in laryngoscopy, the parts being reflected from the mirror which is illuminated by sun or artificial light. Much aid may also be obtained by means of the finger. Czermak speaks highly of the value of a small mirror introduced through the nostril, which should be well illuminated. I have, however, found all the help I wanted in posterior rhinoscopy, taking care to draw forward with great gentleness the soft palate by means of forceps, but this method of examination is always difficult. Diseases of the Nostrils causing obstruction. Nare3 These are very common, and for such the surgeon is often consulted, obstructed by In the infant, such a condition may be the result of congenital syphilis, disease. which will be indicated by the histoi'y of the case and by the concomi- tant symptoms. The snuffles in infancy are very characteristic, and should always direct the practitioner to look out for some syphilitic affection. In isolated cases, such a symptom may be the only one of hereditary syphilis, and, by proper treatment, it may be cured without any other complication making its appearance ; although, as a rule, if looked for, some cutaneous affection will be observed. A grain of grey7 NASAL POLYPUS. powder with three or four grains of dried soda, twice a day, generally proving quiet sufficient to cure the disease. When the mother is suck- ling, the child may be physicked through the mother, five or more grains of the iodide of potassium with quinine, given half an hour before suckling, three times a day, answering every purpose. Of late years, I have followed no other practice. Warty growths are sometimes met with at the orifice of the nostril Warty eausiug obstruction, and I have recorded such a case. They are cured IS' by the removal of the growths. Foreign Bodies in tho Nasal Cavity. Whenever a child suffers from any obstruction to the nasal cavity. Foreign the presence of a foreign body should always be suspected, and the 111 practitioner in such instances should never allow himself to be misled by the absence of a history of its introduction, since instances are not uncommon where some foreign body has been left in the nasal canal for many months. A child, four years of age, came under my care, who had suffered from all the miseries of an obstructed nasal passage for eight months, from the presence of a plum-stone. Many remedies had been tried but without effect, the foreign body being unsuspected. Its removal was rapidly followed by convalescence. Ulcerations of the mucous membrane from the inflammation excited by the foreign body, may tempt the surgeon to overlook the nature of the case. He should therefore remember, that such a disease as ulceration of the nose in children except at the immediate orifice, is by no means common, and that the probabilities of its being excited by a foreign body are very great. When only one nostril is affected, the diagnosis is more sure. The removal of these bodies when firmly impacted, requires some care, 0f and the administration of chloroform cannot be too highly recom- removal, mended, particularly when the child is young. A firm, hook-bent probe introduced down the floor of the nose, may be passed with facility behind the foreign body; or, a noose of wire, twisted or not, inserted along the septum and half turned, will generally, after one or two attempts, hook out the offending body. In some cases a pair of forceps will suffice. Gingerbread and other soft materials may have to be scooped out and the nose well syringed. I have never known any good result from syringing this cavity when any solid body has become impacted, except for the sake of cleanliness. Mechanical means always succeed, and are the simplest, particularly when the child is under the influence of chloroform. In older children and in adult life, obstruction to the nasal passage may be produced by many diseases; and when the presence of a foreign body is the cause, a true history of the case will generally be given, and thus the surgeon is more likely to arrive at a just conclusion as to tlqe character of the disease. Polypus Nasi. This is a common affection, and may be found in one or both nostrils Polypus nasi, of the old or young. It may he of a simple gelatinous, fibro-cellular, or fibrous structure, or of a malignant nature. The gelatiniform and Gelatinous the fibro-cellular are by far the more common forms, and are not dif- °rm' ficult to recognise; and, as a rule, spring from the middle turbinated bone and from its posterior portion, though they may grow from other parts. I have only removed one from the septum. They are8 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. Fig. 303. Treatment. Snuff. Abruption. Noose. Rouge’s operation. seldom recognised in an early condition, since they cause no pain and but little inconvenience. A slight excess of discharge is the earliest symptom, and this is generally regarded as being the result of “cold;” but when this secretion is examined, it will be observed to be more serous than is found to exist in an ordinary coryza. The discharge continuing, may at last cause some anxiety to the patient, and, if the surgeon be consulted, a careful examination with a speculum should be instituted, when a polypus or rather a fringe of polypi, will often be observed on the margin of the middle turbinated bone. When the disease has been made out, removal of the growth is the only effectual treatment. Tonics and local astringents may for a time re- tard their growth, but rarely effect a cure. The use of tannin as a snuff has been very successful in my hands in causing the sloughing off of even the largest polypi (‘ Lancet/ Feb., 1867); but the remedy is uncertain in large polypi, although it is always of great value in destroying the smaller, and thus in checking the progress of the disease. I have had several instruments made to apply the tannin, but the bent glass tube is as good as any. It is modified from one made by a patient for his own use, and answers well. The tannin is put into the small receptacle in the upper half, that end of the tube being inserted into the nostril, and the other into the mouth, and the'patient then blows the tannin into his nostril. The removal of the softer kinds of polypi should always be by abruption. Some surgeons employ a long pair of narrow well-made forceps which fix the pedicle, and then by a slight twist and some force, the removal of the growth is effected. When the polypus hangs far back, the introduction of the finger into the mouth and behind the fauces facilitates its removal. The best instrument known is the “ noose,” and that illustrated in Fig. 304 is the form I prefer. It is so constructed that a loop of wire introduced along the septum and half turned, can be made to pass over the polypus and encircle its peduncle. The loop is then drawn home, the growth strangled at its neck, and abrupted. By these means, the polypus is removed as a whole and bleeding is prevented; consequently, by the use of this instrument, the nose can generally be cleared at one opera- tion. In some cases, I have cured the disease by cutting off with along pair of scissors the turbinated bone from which these polypi grow. A few days after the removal of the polypi by the snare, tannin, as a snuff, may be employed. In severe cases in which this treatment has been employed with but poor success. Rouge’s operation, as suggested by him for the treatment of certain cases of ozseua in 1873 may be performed, the operation con- sisting in the elevation of the upper lip and soft parts of the nose from their osseous attachments by means of an incision made beneath the lip through the mucous membrane where it is reflected from the lip into the gums, the lip and nasal cartilages by these means being so freed from their attachments as to allow the surgeon to lift them upNASAL POLYPUS. 9 as a whole towards the forehead, and thus reaching the nasal cavity for purposes of exploration or operation. To give more room, the septum Pig. 304-. Removal of nasal polypus by noose. nasi may require to he separate from its base. After the operation the parts readily fall into position, and should be kept there by strapping. No deformity or visible scar follows the operation. This form of polypus seems to be more common in men than in women, and is a disease of young adult life. I have known it, however, in one instance, to appear in a man aged seventy-five. The firmer and fibrous forms of polypi are by no means so common as Fibrous the gelatinous, and seldom spring from the turbinated bones. They grow form, more frequently from the upper and posterior portion of the nasal cavity, from the top of the pharynx and the posterior nares and have a periosteal origin. They do not make their appearance so early in life as the gelatinous, are far more serious in their nature, and more difficult to treat, on account of their position; but when removed, they rarely re- turn. The best mode of treatment is to ligature them through the Treatment, nose by means of a loop of whipcord or wire passed through the nostril into the pharynx and slipped over the growth. When this operation cannot be performed, the nostril may be laid open to give room for manipulation, or it may be necessary to remove the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, or displace the body of, but not remove, the upper jaw itself, to reach the tumour. In 1865, I removed a large Examples, tumour of this kind which completely obstructed the posterior nares of a boy, set. 14, by the ligature introduced through the nostril (‘ Path. Trans.,5 vol. xviii), and in 1868, I removed a second from a lad, set. 18, in the same way. In 1872, in another case, I took away a portion of the upper jaw to get at a tumour of the splieno-maxillary fossa which filled up the nostril from behind. Some of these polypi grow from the antrum and press inwards. The surgeon should bear this fact in mind in examining a case, as it may materially affect his treatment. Cancerous tumours of the nose are found in practice, although not Cancerous frequently. They may attack the body of the organ, as seen in Fig. 305, tumours, or grow from within and press forwards or backwards, filling in the anterior or posterior nares, when they are difficult to diagnose. They are, perhaps, more common in the old than in the young, although two cases have passed under my care in patients under thirty. They are' SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. inerally associated with bleeding either from the nose or pharynx, hen they grow from within, their removal, when it can be effected,' an expedient practice if only to give relief, and this can be done uch in the same way as in the other varieties of polypi. Conditions simulating polypus.—The conditions of the nasal cavity lich are not infrequently mistaken for polypus are, however, numerous. Many such have passed under my notice, the patients applying for the removal of such a growth, when in reality no growth existed. Malformation of the septum nasi is one of the most common. In it the septum projects either into the right or left nostril, causing more or less ob- struction to respiration, and leading a superficial observer to believe in the presence of some new growth. This deformity may sometimes be the result of an injury; and when so, there is generally some lateral twist of the nose itself. The knowledge of the existence of such a condition is quite sufficient to prevent any careful sur- geon falling into this error. I need hardly add, that by no surgical treat- ment can this condition be remedied. Cancer of nose. A chronic inflammation and thicken- ing of the mucons lining of the nose is another condition which may be, and frequently is, mistaken for polypus. In itthe patient complains of difficulty in respiration, andfeels that there is something in the nose which mechanically impedes that function. On examining the cavity, a smooth, projecting, and firm outgrowth will be observed on its outer wall, which may be regarded as a polypus, hut which is really only the lower turbinated bone covered by a thickened and inflamed mucous membrane. In a case such as this, if a little care be taken in sifting its history, it will probably be found, that an obstruction to the respiration will be the only symptom of im- portance ; there will be no serous discharge, such as is so copious in cases of polypi, although there may be a discharge of tenacious mucous; yet this is not common; since the secreting function of the mucous mem- brane in these cases will generally be found diminished, and a great dryness present, accompanied by a loss of the sense of smell. Treatment. The best treatment in such examples is the constitutional, in the form of tonics, using that which appears to be more suited to the general wants of the patient’s system. Some slight stimulating lotion such as the sulphate or chloride of zinc, or nitrate of silver of the strength of two grains to the ounce, may at times be required, but constitutional means alone are generally sufficient. Removal of the turbinated bone for this affection has been advocated and performed by some surgeons. I have adopted the practice in a few obstinate cases with marked success. It is worthy of observation that this disease is at times confined to the mucous membrane over the lower turbinated bone; and for reasons which I am unable to explain. 1( gc Removal.

The septum may likewise be the seat of inflammation eithei acute or chronic; aud, as a result, great swelling of the soft parts covering it in will be present, giving rise to obstruction.

This term is applied to a large aud important class of cases where an Ozsena. offensive discharge, or rather smell, is the common symptom, which is due to many different morbid conditions. It has been said that this offensive smell is the result of some morbid Source of secretion of the part, but my own experience has not furnished me fetor- with any information tending to confirm such an idea, and, I believe, that the fetor is generally, if not always, the result of the decomposi- tion of retained mucus. At one time it may be associated with an ulcer of the mucous membrane; and at another, with some diseased bone the result of syphilis or otherwise; but, under all circumstances, the disease is an insidious one, and many months have usually elapsed before it comes under the notice of the surgeon or medical adviser. The patient at first believes the symptoms to depend upon an ordi- Symptoms, nary catarrh; the discharge from the nose being thick, but not offensive, and the sense of smell more or less impaired. If these symptoms continue, the health of the sufferer often declines, and the physician is consulted on account of want of power, the local symptoms assuming a secondary importance. If the nose be examined at this time, as it Local should be, with a speculum, to obtain a good view7 of the whole, the examination, only visible morbid condition will be, intense congestion of the mucous membrane, which will not be much, if at all thickened. This con- gestion of the mucous membrane being associated with excess of secretion. Treatment.—The only correct and satisfactory treatment is the Treatment, constitutional. When the general condition of the body is improved the General, local disease will disappear. To this end the hygienic conditions by which the patient is surrounded should be considered. If tonics, as quinine or iron are indicated, they should be administered; the secre- tions also should be attended to, and all external and internal causes removed which may prove detrimental to health. The local treatment Local, consists in absolute cleanliness and the removal of all retained secretions, and for this purpose there is nothing equal to the use of the douche (Fig. 299), saline medicated lotions being employed. The inhalation of steam will at times assist the removal of the secretion and relieve the state of fulness of the part, of which some patients so much com- plain. In other cases, the injection of warm water affords relief, especially if the discharges have a tendency to desiccate, adhere to the mucous lining, and, as a consequence, to putrefy ; since it is this putre- faction of the retained muco-purulent secretion on which essentially depends the condition denominated ozcena. Ozccna, therefore, may be simply the result of a state like that which has just been described ; and if so, must be treated on like principles. The offensive discharge must be removed by the free use of a douche or syringe, so that noSURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. 12 Treatment where ulceration. May end in necrosis.

Diagnosis. lnuco-purulent secretion can be allowed to remain to decompose, and so one of the most troublesome symptom of fetor will be removed and in future prevented. Medicated lotions are sometimes required, such as iodine lotion, Condy’s fluid, carbolic acid, the sulphate or chloride of zinc, or nitrate of silver, in the strength of about one grain to the ounce of water. The inhalation of the fumes of iodine is always useful. But ozsena does not always depend upon such simple local conditions. It may arise from some ulceration of the passage, an ulceration that may be seen through the speculum, and, if not seen, suspected to exist when an occasional escape of a blood-stained muco-purulent secretion takes place. The principles of treatment under these circumstances, are—tonics constitutionally, with cleanliness locally ; topical stimulants being em- ployed when simpler means have failed, or, when great indolence of the part is present. These cases are, however, very obstinate, and much time is fre- quently required to bring about a cure—several months being often not long enough; but the fetor, which is the chief symptom of annoyance to the sufferer, may speedily be removed by the mechanical and local means already suggested, and so the worst feature of the disease becomes destroyed, and the mental as well as the physical comfort of the patient secured. When, however, this inflammatory action and perhaps ulceration is allowed to continue, a different result will ensue; the bone itself becoming involved, and as a result necrosis follows. In so-called strumous sub- jects, this condition is not infrequent. I have no evidence to give that such a necrosis is always the result of the extension of the in- flammation from the soft parts around the bone to the bone itself. In many cases, if not in the majority, I believe the disease originates in the bones. Necrosis of bone in the nose is not an unfrequent condition, and, as such, is another cause of the disease described as ozeena. It is found in children as well as in adult life, and may be the result of injury, extension of disease from the soft parts covering the bones, or asso- ciated with the so-called strumous diathesis, or with the syphilitic poison. Occasionally it takes place without any such distinct cause, when it is described as idiopathic; it being well known, that inflamma- tion of bone may arise per se. When ozeena is the result of necrosed bone, the fetor is generally of a peculiar character, such as is well known to accompany diseased bone; and under these circumstances, by careful examination with the speculum or probe, bare bones will often be detected, by which the nature of the disease becomes tolerably evident. In early life, I believe that inherited syphilis is a more frequent cause of this affection than is generally suspected, and this opinion has been confirmed by the presence of other marked symptoms in some cases, such as old skin diseases, syphilitic teeth, or keratitis. To form a correct opinion in all cases of ozmna, a careful history of the case must be obtained and well-known symptoms not over- looked, for unless an accurate knowledge of the case can be acquired, the treatment adopted must be doubtful, and consequently unsuccessful.13 DISEASE OF THE FRONTAL SINES. Treatment.—When the presence of necrosed hone has been made Treatment, out as the cause of the disease called ozsena, it is tolerably evident that the patient will not recover until the fetid bone has been removed, or rather has exfoliated. To this end, the preservation of perfect clean- liness by means of the douche or syringe, with or without stimulating or antiseptic lotions, may be employed, and tonics administered. If syphilis, either hereditary or acquired is the apparent cause, our remedies must be modified to the general requirements of the patient. Mercurials are seldom necessary, although in children suffering from Tonics; this disease, where the history and other symptoms of congenital sy- iolliue- philis are present, I have given them, associated with tonics, with marked benefit, and, in obstinate cases in adult life, such a combina- tion may also he employed. The perchloride and green iodide have Perchloride proved the best forms in my experience, and, when combined with of mercu,7- tonics such as quinine, hark, or iron, are invaluable. I generally prescribe the perchloride with bark, and the iodide in pills at bed- time, the patient taking at the same time the syrup of the iodide of iron and the iodide of potassium in some bitter infusion, such as quassia. If mercurials are not indicated or required, the combination of the iodides of iron and potassium cannot be too highly valued. In strumous subjects, perfect local cleanliness, and perhaps stimu- lants, accompanied with tonics, as cod-liver oil, quinine, or iron alone, or in combination, generally suffice. Nasal Calculi or Rhinolithes. Such cases have been recorded though I have never seen an in- Nasal calculi, stance. They may be small or so large as to obstruct the nostril, and may be formed around foreign bodies introduced from without. Obstruction and more or less pain are said to be the chief symptoms, and occasionally a copious discharge of mucous or pus. The calculus can be detected on examination, and when found, it should he removed by douche, snare, or forceps. Cases are on record in which the con- cretion was crushed before removal. Disease of the Frontal Sinus. The frontal sinuses as part of the nose, are liable to many of its Diseases of diseases. Acute or chronic catarrhal inflammation is by no means un- ,lle frolltal common ; both giving rise to a dull heavy pain over the forehead, which smus' the inhalation of the fumes of half a grain, or more of opium thrown on a hot piece of metal often speedily relieves. Acute suppuration of these sinuses is occasionally met with, and is Suppuration attended with severe local and general symptoms. Uuder these circum- stances, the application of the trephine to the outer shell of bone may be required. Necrosis of the bones covering in the sinuses may exist, and the latter are also liable to fracture. New growths may likewise New growths, be found in this locality—cancerous, myeloid, or bony; the ivory osseous growths being more frequently found in the air-cells of the frontal bone and nasal fossae than in any other locality. From modern investio-a- tions they appear to have a periosteal origin and soon becomes loose. In Hilton’s well-known case, the growth sloughed away. In the case Ell0st0sis from which Figs. 306 and 307 were taken, the osseous mass was evi- dently dying when it was removed. It had been growing in the frontal sinus of a man, set. 24, for four years, and had gradually encroachedFig. 307. Rhino-pin operation. Indian method. Enostosis after removal. ment from the forehead. The operation is by no means common. It may be undertaken to restore the nose wholly or in part, and the amount of healthy integument required for this purpose will be regulated by the want.

I enucleated it from its bed by means of an elevator, after having taken away the layer of frontal bone that covered it in. A good recovery ensued (‘ Guy’s Hospital Reports,’ 1873-4). M. F „nfi Olivier’s treatise upon the subject, pub- lished in Paris in 1869, gives all the facts known about such growths. In all tu- mours occupying the centreof the frontal region in children, the possibility that any one may be a hernia of the brain or its membranes should he borne in mind. Rhino-plastic or Taliacotian opera- tions. Gaspar Tagliacozzi, or Taliacotius, Professor of Anatomy and Surgery in the University of Bologna, was the first to bring these operations into notoriety, and they have consequently been named after him. He was not, however, the originator of the operation, as he him- self refers to earlier men, such as A. Pare and others, who have recommended it, but he was the first to practise it with much success, and quite deserves the fame that attended his efforts. His principal work, published in 1597, at Venice, only two years before his death, gives the histories of the cases in which he operated. His method consisted essentially in taking a flap of skin from the arm and transplanting it to the nose, and so restoring that organ to its normal appearance where there had been any loss of substance. Modern surgeons, instead of following the great Italian example, generally prefer to adopt the Indian method, and take the integu- Euostosis of frontal sinus.15 RHINO-PLASTIC OPERATIONS. must, however, always he careful to give himself abundance of new Mode of material; and, having satisfied himself of the wants of the individual performance, case, and that the parts upon which he is about to operate have long lost all traces of disease, he can then map out upon the centre or lateral portion of the forehead of the patient that portion of integument he proposes to transplant, having planned it beforehand on a piece of paper, plaster, or wash-leather. The shape re- quired for a nose and columna will he such as is indicated in Figs. 302 and 308, the flap measuring three inches in both diameters. The surgeon shall then make raw the whole sur- face of the old nose to which the flap is to be united, cutting a deep groove close down to the bones bounding the nasal cavity for the reception of the new flap. A sponge may then be firmly pressed upon this raw surface to arrest the bleeding, while the surgeon proceeds to dissect up the integument he had previously marked out upon the forehead. In doing this, care should be observed not to bruise or otherwise injure this borrowed skin. The incision should be clean and extend down to the hone. The flap should be dissected up boldly and freely, care being observed to leave a good neck through which the circulation can he maintained, and to make it long enough to allow of its being turned round. For this purpose, it is a good practice to make the incision on the side to which the twist is to be made a little longer than the other. When all bleeding has ceased, the frontal flap with the external surface still uppermost should be turned half round, and applied to the nasal raw surface, to which it is to be carefully stitched; the columnar portion being well pressed down into the groove made for it, and fixed. The new nostrils ought to he supported by oiled cotton wool or lint, and the surface covered with the same material to maintain its warmth. The gaping wound on the forehead can then to he brought together as far as possible by means of strapping, and left to heal by granulation— the operation of skin-grafting expediting repair. The sutures may he removed on the second or third day. For the next month, the greatest care is requisite in the dressing of the wound, and in keeping the nostrils up with a plug, the one suggested by Langenbeck being the best; and, as soon as the new flap has consolidated, the neck of integu- ment at the root of the nose may be divided. In the case illustrated (Fig. 309), such a practice was not called for, I operated upon it in 1872 with an excellent result. When the formation of the columna is required, Liston’s plan is the one generally employed, and is thus described in his own words : “ Restoration of the columna is an operation which, in this and other Fig. 308. Flap to measure three inches in both diameters.16 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. On restoration of the columns. Operation described. civilised countries, must be more frequently required than tbe restora- tion ot the whole nose. This latter operation came to be practised in consequence of tbe frequency of multilations as a punishment; but the punishment for some of our sins is left to Nature, and she generally relents before the whole of tbe organ disappears. This columna is frequently destroyed by ulcera- tion. The deformity produced by its loss, is not far short of that caused by destruction of the whole nose. Happily, after the ulceration has been checked the part can be renewed neatly, safely,and without much suffer- ing to the patient. The opera- tion which I have practised successfully for some years, and in many instances, is thus performed:—The inner surface of the apex is first pared. A sharp-pointed bistoury is then passed through the upper lip— previously stretched and raised by an assistant—close to the ruins of the former columna, and about an eighth of an inch on one side of the mesial line. The incision is continued down, in a straight direction, to the free margin of the lip; and a similar one, parallel to the former, is made on the opposite side of the mesial line, so as to insulate a flap about a quarter of an inch in breadth, and composed of skin, mucous membrane, and interposed sub- stance. The frsenulum is then divided, and the prolabium of the flap removed. In order to fix a new columna firmly aud with accuracy in its proper place, a sewing needle is passed from without through the apex of the nose, and obliquely through the extremity of the elevated flap; a few turns of thread over this suffices to approximate and retain the surfaces. It is to be observed that the flap is not twisted round, as in the operation already detailed, but simply elevated, so as to do away with the risk of failure. Twisting is here unnecessary, for the mucous lining of the lip, forming the outer surface of the columna, readily assumes the colour and appearance of integument, after ex- posure for some time. The fixing of the columna having been accom- plished, the edges of the lip must be neatly brought together.” The sutures can be removed on the third or fourth day, when, as a rule, the parts have cicatrised. The ultimate result of the case depends materially upon the care bestowed upon its after-treatment. In the case illustrated in Fig. 309, which I operated upon several years ago, a gratifying result ensued, the bridge of the nose re- quiring no second operation. Dr. Lichtenberg has had within the last few years some very successful cases ; and the late Mr. Skey had some excellent results in his practice. I saw one that he had operated upon years before, which was very excellent. It is well, however, to remember Fia. 309. Appearance of face after formation of new nose.SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF LARYNX AND TRACHEA. 17 Mr. Skey’s advice when, he says, “ Let it be the patient who urges the operation.” Of late years, Langenheck has suggested the propriety of dissect- ing up the periosteum from the frontal bone with the skin flap so as to give a bony nose, but it is a question how far this osteo- rhinoplasty is an advantage. The operation has not found much favour. When only one ala has to he restored, the flap may either he taken from the nose itself or from the cheek, the particulars of the plan being left to the ingenuity of the surgeon to determine. CHAPTER XVIII. SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. The larynx and windpipe may he contused from external injury, or, the cartilages and trachea rings fractured; the severity of the symp- toms following these accidents varying according to the amount of injury to the parts. Thus, some years ago, a case came under my care in which the thyroid cartilage was fractured obliquely across its body. The accident was attended with much bleeding and cough, hut these soon disappeared, and an excellent recovery ensued. In 1877, Dr. A. Corley, of Dublin, recorded a case, in which after death the second, third, and possibly the fourth cartilages of the trachea were fractured and projected unevenly into the tube, associated with suppuration around a necrosed cricoid car- tilage. The preparation was taken from a woman, fet. 36, who had been squeezed in the throat some weeks before, and was admitted into the Richmond Hospital with dyspnoea, stridulous breathing, congestion of face, and external signs of inflammation about her throat, and for which tracheotomy had been unsuccessfully performed. The trachea may also be completely divided subcutaneously. I saw this in June, 1876, at Guy’s Hospital, in the case of a man, set. 47, who was crushed between a barge and the side of a vessel, the prow of the barge striking his neck. The accident was followed by dyspnoea and some emphysema of the neck, but the symptoms were not urgent so long as the erect position was maintained, but the recumbent was impossible. The man lived fifty hours and died quietly. After death, the trachea was found to be completely severed below the thyroid body; the two ends being separated for an inch and a half, while the lower end was below the innominate vein. There was no external bruise to denote the severity of the injury. Wounds of the Throat. These are generally made by the hand of the suicide, and conse- quently have a double interest; the dangers of the local injury being complicated with the peculiar mental condition of the sufferer. It is essential, therefore, for the surgeon to dwell seriously beforehand upon VOL. II. 2 Fracture of larynx. Subcutane- ous division of trachea. Wounds of the throat.Superficial. Deep. Haemorrhage may occur. Examples. Haemorrhage into trachea. Division of the tongue. 18 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF LARYNX AND TRACHEA. the necessities of these cases, in order that in the hour of danger he may be prepared to act with energy and decision. In the majority of cases of “ cut throat ” the wound is only of a superficial nature, and simply involves skin, or skin and muscle, and does not implicate either the pharynx or the respiratory tract. These cases require no other local treatment than that usually employed for skin wounds, such as .sutures and warm-water dressing. When the wound is of a deeper character, it may penetrate into the pharynx and air-passages, or involve the deep vessels, the dangers of the case being much determined by the position of the wound. My colleague Mr. Durham in an able article in ‘ Holmes’s Surgery,’ (2nd Ed.) asserts, that of 158 unselected cases the wound was Above the hyoid bone in . Through the thyro-hyoid membrane in Through the thyroid cartilage in Through the crico-thyroid membrane in Into the trachea in . 11 cases. 45 „ 35 „ 26 „ 41 „ The respiratory tract was opened in about two thirds of the cases. In all cases of cut throat, hcemorrhage as the direct result of a divided or wounded artery or vein is to be apprehended; and, although from the deep position of the carotid artery and jugular vein these vessels in the majority of cases escape injury, yet when they are divided death is usually rapid. Partial or complete division of some of the branches of these vessels is, however, not unfrequent. A man in Guy’s, tot. 21, in a fit of despondency cut his throat, and died from profuse haemorrhage into the lung before help could be obtained. The blood was found after death to have come from a divided superior thyroid artery. An inmate of St. George’s divided the left common carotid artery and wounded the internal jugular vein with a penknife, and died before the house surgeon could arrive. “A gentleman, who committed suicide by cutting deeply between the os hyoides and thyroid cartilage, partially divided the external carotid artery on the right side, just as it was given off; the flow of blood was immense, and he was found dead within ten minutes of the in- fliction of the wound.” (Fothergillian Prize Essay for 1836, by my father, the late Mr. T. E. Bryant.) In Guy’s Museum, Prep. 171179, the left internal jugular vein maybe seen divided; the cut being between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, and proving speedily fatal. Prep. 17119 shows division of the inferior thyroid artery. Blood may flow into the trachea and, suddenly or slowly, cause asphyxia ; it may coagulate over the orifice of the larynx with the same result. Mr. Le Gros Clark has also shown (‘ Surg. Diag.,’ 1870) how air may enter the circulation through a partially divided vein and destroy life in twenty-four hours. When the incision is above the hyoid bone and deep, the tongue may be divided, and the loosened portion by falling over the orifice of the larynx may cause sudden death by suffocation. In wounds of this description, the surgeon should consequently guard against the possi- bility of this contingency taking place by passing a thread through the tongue and drawing it forward.19 WOUNDS OF THE THROAT. Again, when the cut is just above the thyroid cartilage, the epiglottis Epiglottis may be divided, and this falling into the larynx may cause fatal dyspnoea. cu ' To prevent this a stitch should be inserted into the divided portion and the parts adjusted. The same result may take place when any portion of the orifice of the larynx has been detached. Indeed all loose bodies likely to obstruct respiration should be fixed. Emphysema is. by no means an uncommon complication of cut throat when the respiratory tract has been opened, and is not, as a rule, a dangerous occurrence. It is more common when the external wound is small. Inflammation of the air-tubes and lungs is the secondary danger Secondary of wounds of the throat involving the air-passages; and, when the an»ers- pharynx or oesophagus has been opened this risk is aggravated by the possible introduction of food into the trachea. Purulent infiltration of the cellular tissue of the neck may also ensue, or oedema of the glottis; and, at a later date, the air-passages may be obstructed by the cicatrization of the wound or the contraction of the trachea. In exceptional cases a permanent fistulous opening may be left. The immediate danger of a wound in the throat consequently depends General (1) on the quantity of blood lost; (2) on the risk of suffocation from summary, that blood flowing into the air-tube; (3) the danger of suffocation by tissues divided and partially separated from their connections obstruct- ing the larynx. The secondary dangers are those of oedema of the larynx and inflammation of the air-passages, and, later on, from sub- sequent narrowing of the divided tube by the contraction of new tissue around it. Treatment.—The first duty of the surgeon under all circumstances Treatment, is to arrest haemorrhage. Arteries ought to be ligatured or twisted, l. Arrest as all deep veins when moderate pressure fails to check the flow of haemorrhage, blood. A wounded artery or vein should be ligatured above and below the wound. A small wound in the internal jugular vein must be tied with a fine thread. The second duty of the surgeon is to prevent suffocation. He should 2. Prevent see that the respiratory orifice is kept clear of blood or of any divided suffocation, structure such as the tongue or epiglottis. Coagula ought to be speedily removed, and respiration encouraged by artificial means when natural processes have failed. When the larynx or trachea has been wounded, the aim of the 3. Adapt the surgeon should be to keep the divided pieces of the tube in continuity divided tube and not to allow the upper portion to overlap the lower, and thus iu Position- obstruct the respiration; at the same time, care must be taken to keep the wounded parts sufficiently open to allow of the escape of the mucus which is always profuse, and to permit the free ingress of air. If the wound is very extensive, and difficulties arise in carry- Sutures, ing out the above indications, sutures may be introduced; but it must be left to the surgeon’s judgment to decide when they may be neces- sary, according to the exigencies of the individual case. In large wounds where the parts cannot be kept together, a suture is often of immense benefit, and sutures when applied should be put in firmlv, including often the whole thickness of the tissues. Their object can only be to fix the divided parts in position, and to prevent, by their sudden movement, any mechanical obstruction to the respiratory act. To do this effectually, the measures employed should be boldlyHead to be bent forward. Warm and moist atmosphere. When (Esophageal tube required. Tracheotomy in cut throat.

The head should he kept forward by the application of bandages, and water dressing applied to the wound itself; constant attention is demanded of the nurse to keep the wound clear of dis- charge, and to see that no obstruction to the breathing takes place. The atmosphere the patient breathes should be kept warm and made moist by the introduction of steam, and the wound covered with muslin. The closest attention should be paid to the patient by a skilful nurse, and every mental and bodily want or weakness cared for. As regards nourishment, abundance should always be provided, although it is not such an easy task for the patient to take it. When the pharynx or oesophagus is extensively opened, the patient should never be allowed to swallow, but be fed by means of a tube passed either through the nose or mouth, and not through the wound, and directed with the finger carefully down the throat into the lower portion of the oesophagus. Through this, beef tea, eggs, brandy, and other liquid nourishment, such as the symptoms indicate, may be periodically administered. I have an instance before me where the pharynx was extensively opened above the os hyoides, and where the patient was kept alive by such means for nearly six weeks, the tube having been passed through the nose. At the end of this time he was able to swallow, and recovery ensued. When acting as dresser to the late Mr. Aston Key, I bad a case where the wound was inflicted through the trachea, dividing the oesophagus. In this instance the man was fed twice daily through a tube passed through the mouth and directed with care into the lower oesophageal opening; this practice being carried on for many weeks, was rewarded by recovery. The plan of treat- ment just indicated, however, is only rational, and is such as any surgeon would naturally suggest. All complications, such as suppura- tion in the cellular tissues around the wound, bronchitis, or broncho- pneumonia, are to be dealt with as they arise. Some have sug- gested the propriety of tracheotomy in severe cases of cut throat, so as to allow the wound to be closed. I am unable, however, to see the advantages offered by this practice in ordinary cases; although in wounds involving the epiglottis or upper part of the larynx, when inflammatory oedema appears as a secondary result, causing obstruction to respiration and threatening life, there is no doubt as to the wisdom of the practice. These cases, however, are uncommon. Among the most remote dangers of such wounds, the mechanical obstruction of exuberant granulations ought to be mentioned; like- wise, some narrowing of the air-passage, as a consequence of contrac- tion of the cicatrix, or tracheal fistulse. These results are common to traumatic and surgical wounds of the part. In Prep. 171111, Guy’s Hosp. Museum, both the trachea and oesophagus are much contracted above the opening, and, in a less degree, below. This preparation was taken from a patient who had lived for many years after a wound which had involved both the trachea and oesophagus. In 1873, I was called upon to perform tracheotomy on a man, set. 57, who had cut his throat through the thyroid cartilage sixteen months previously, and for eight or ten months had been suffering from gradually increasing difficulty of breathing, due to the contraction of the air-passage, and this patient has ever since been obliged to wear the canula. In the seventh vol. of the * Clin. Soc. Trans.’ an interesting case of the kind has been recorded by Mr. H. Lee.FOREIGN BODIES IN THE WINDPIPE. 21 Foreign Bodies in the Windpipe. There are few accidents which excite more anxiety and alarm to a ^ei"n looker-on than the passage of a foreign body into the larynx or trachea, ^u'apipe. C The unfortunate subject, in the midst of apparent health or happiness, is suddenly forced to make violent struggles for life, and to the spec- tator death seems imminent. In the surgeon’s mind no less painful feelings are excited, for unless by bis art timely relief can be afforded, the danger which is apparent becomes real, and death becomes almost a certainty. The majority of the victims of such an accident are children, although adults are not exempt from such a contingency. A foreign body may be inhaled at any moment, sudden inspiration Mode of being sufficient when the mouth is full, and especially when that ^0(jy foreign body is smooth, light, or small, such as a fruit stone, bead, bean, nut, or coin. Vomited matter may likewise be drawn by inspira- tion into the air-tubes by patients in a state of unconsciousness, as when under chloroform, or in an epileptic fit, and so produce death, or through fistulous openings between the oesophagus and trachea, the result of simple or cancerous ulceration. The body may be lodged at the orifice of the larynx (Fig. 310), and thus cause sudden asphyxia; situation of or pass into the rirna, where it may be arrested, or into the trachea or the foreign bronchi, the right bronchus being its most common seat. The size and shape of the foreign body determines many of these points; for whilst a large one will naturally be arrested at the orifice of the larynx, a small will probably pass through ; and a jogged and light body, such as a piece of nut-shell, would be more likely to be caught in the rirna than a small round body, as a bean.

Most frequent in right bronchus. Symptoms. Sudden fits of cough. Altered voice. Variation in breathing. Auscultation. Examples of impaction without symptoms. In the case of a child, set. 2£, on whom I unsuccessfully operated in 1864, a date stone was found impacted in the right bronchus, while its upper end was pressing against the left side of the trachea, and exciting ulceration (Pig. 311). The child lived four days. In another case recorded in my ‘Clinical Surgery,’ Part II, a bean was firmly impacted in the right bronchus, causing complete obstruction to the right lung. The fact that the septum at the division of the trachea is some- what to the left of the median line is probably the explanation of the right bronchus being more frequently the seat of the foreign body than the left. This was pointed out by Goodall of Dublin. The larger size of the right bronchus doubtless favours this tendency. The symptoms which attend the entrance of a foreign body into the air-passages are somewhat characteristic, although those that follow are often obscure. The most typical is a violent convulsive cough coming on abruptly, followed by difficult respiration, and a feeling of suffocation—this spasmodic cough being likely to recur at intervals on any movement. When the voice is altered in character, whistling or stridulous, it is suggestive of the foreign body being near the rima, and impacted; and when there is tenderness of the larynx on manipulation or pain, this suspicion is strengthened. When an extraneous body is in any part of the larynx, but more particularly in the ventricles, the spas- modic derangement to which it gives rise, too often proves speedily fatal. In children, rapid suffocation is a common result of such a cause, death being more from spasm of the glottis than from mechanical ob- struction by the foreign body. When the breathing of the patient is at times natural, and at others disturbed by a paroxysm of cough or dyspnoea, and when these symptoms are brought on by any movement or violent respiratory effort, it is probable that the foreign body is loose in the trachea or one of its divisions ; indeed, patients are conscious occasionally of the movement of the body. When by auscultation it can be made out that air enters one lung freely and the other feebly, the exact seat of impaction of the foreign body is indicated, and the amount of dyspnoea present will depend upon the closeness of the impaction. When the extraneous body has passed through the larynx into the trachea, there may be long intervals of repose between the attacks of laryngeal spasm; but any spasm may prove fatal. Many cases are now on record in which foreign bodies, particularly coins, have been impacted in a bronchus, and have given rise to no urgent symptoms for years. Dupuytren in one of his lectures given in 1833 relates a case where a coin was known to have been in the air- passage for ten years without producing any very distressing effects, and was found after death to occupy a tubercular excavation. Professor Gross gives a case in which a portion of bone is said to have been coughed up, after having been retained for sixty years. Cases such as these, however, should never allow the surgeon to rest satisfied, or permit a foreign body to remain in the air-passages ; for so long as it does, death may at any moment be produced by sudden convulsive laryngeal spasm. Difficulty of breathing is not uncommon as a consequence of the arrest of food in the oesophagus or lower part of the pharynx, and ah23 FOREIGN BODIES IN THE WINDPIPE. first siglit, the surgeon might think that the symptoms are due to Foreign the presence of some foreign body in the air-passage. When doubt bodies in exists, the patient should be made to swallow ; in laryngeal obstruction ®®°P“aag"8 no difficulty will be experienced by the act, whereas in pharyngeal it dyspnoea, will be impossible. Under other circumstances a probang may be carefully introduced into the oesophagus, and, in every case, a careful exploration of the throat and pharynx with the finger should be made. When the foreign body is impacted in the pharynx and cannot be removed, and laryngeal spasm threatens life, the windpipe may require to be opened. The surgeon should always hesitate to employ force in pressing a foreign body downwards. Treatment.—Given the diagnosis of a foreign body in the windpipe, Treatment, the duty of the surgeon plainly is to endeavour to remove it. There should be no deviation from this resolution, because so long as a foreign body remains in the air-passage sudden death is imminent, as spasm of the larynx may be produced by any movement of the foreign body, and any may prove fatal. The surgeon should never allow himself to be misled by the mildness of the symptoms nor by the knowledge that in rare instances foreign bodies have remained' in the passage for years, and even then been expelled, as such cases are exceptional. The accident is one that will inevitably destroy life, although it must be doubtful at what time, or in what form, danger may appear. In all urgent cases in which spasm of the larynx threatens life, Tracheotomy tracheotomy should be performed; because with an opening in the trachea, a fatal spasm is impossible, and the surgeon may then proceed to investigate the case. In cases in which life appears to be extinguished the same practice should be adopted, artificial respiration being subse- quently maintained. Should the symptoms point to the larynx as Further the seat of the impaction, the upper orifice should be closely examined measures to by the finger introduced through the mouth, and a full-sized bougie 1,6 a<lol>teii- or catheter introduced from below through the wound into the larynx. By these measures most foreign bodies caught and impacted in the larynx itself may be removed. In exceptional cases where these measures fail, the surgeon may be called upon to lay open the larynx. The laryngoscope at times will be an invaluable aid in guiding to the position of the foreign body and in effecting its extraction. It is only applicable, however, in adults. When the position of the foreign body is known, its removal may be facilitated by curved forceps. In children, the opening in the trachea should always be as high as Laryngo- possible, and there is no objection to dividing the cricoid cartilage tracheotomy (laryngo-tracheotomy) to reach the larynx. Laryngotomy is scarcely applicable to these cases, the majority being found in children. When the foreign body is so fixed in the larynx as to be immovable by the means suggested, the thyroid cartilage must be laid open by increasing Enlarging of the incision upwards. In doing this the larynx will be fully exposeef, t*le wound, and the removal of the body facilitated. When the foreign body has passed the larynx and is in the trachea, a free opening should be made low down in the passage, which when done it not unfrequently happens that the foreign body is expelled. If not, the patient may be inverted, and succussion employed, that is, the patient Succussion. should be patted sharply on the back or shaken with the view of dis- lodging it.Use of forceps. Use of can ula. Valvular opening in trachea. 24 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF LARYNX AND TRACHEA. Some surgeons advise the introduction of forceps or other instru- ment through the wound into the trachea for the removal of the foreign body, and in recent times success has followed the practice. Thus in May, 1876, Mr. Maunder extracted, by means of a loop of silver wire through an opening made in the trachea, a glass sleeve link from the left bronchus of a boy set. 13. Mr. Hulke, in August, 1876, hooked out of the right bronchus of a woman, set. 37, the outer tube of a tracheotomy canula by means of a piece of German silver wire bent into a hook; and Mr. Lucas, on November 16,1877, removed by means of forceps the same kind of thing from the left bronchus of a man set. 57, the tube having been in the bronchus for seven weeks. Pig. 312 represents an excellent pair of forceps for this purpose. It was made for Dr. S. D. Gross, of Louisville, before 1854, and is taken from his book on ‘Foreign Bodies in the Air-passages.’ “They,” as described by him, “are composed of silver, and are a little upwards Fig. 312. of eight inches in length. The handle is considerably curved on the flat, and has two large rings for the thumb and finger. The blades, which are rounded and very slender, are five inches long and terminate each in a fenestrated extremity, nine lines in length by three lines in width, the outer surface being smooth and convex, the inner flat and slightly serrated. The blades when shut slightly overlap each other. The weight of the instrument is a little over five drachms. The in- strument, being long and slender, may be used as a probe; being com- posed of silver may be bent at any point and in any direction; and being delicate cannot impede the passage of air during its use.” When these means fail to remove the foreign body, the patient must be left; but the wound in the air-tube should be kept open. If the foreign body be in the larynx, the canula may be intro- duced, but when in the trachea or bronchus, such a practice is injurious, as preventing the escape of the substance. Under these circumstances Hilton’s suggestion is undoubtedly the best—the forma- tion of a transverse valvular opening in the trachea, which readily allows of the escape of the foreign body when impelled against its surface. The cutting out of a portion of the trachea is quite un- necessary. The tracheal wound can also be held open by hooks, or fastened by ligatures. In one case in which the trachea was deep I managed to keep the tracheal wound open by means of a divided ring of strong wire embracing the neck, its two ends being made to hook into the opening into the air-passage, and acting as retractors. In another I held the wound apart by means of a wire instrument made on the principle of the eye speculum. When efforts fail at one time for the removal of the body, they may be successful at another. Mr. Brunei’s well-known case is one in point. Mr. Durham informs us from an analysis of 554 cases of foreign bodies in the air-passages, that25 SCALD OP THE LABYNX. death resulted in forty-two per cent, when no operation was performed.

In exceptional instances it may prove troublesome it not Qj- body, fatal. The nature of the substance has also much influence in.deter- mining this result, smooth bodies being slightly irritating, while jagged are more so. The operation of tracheotomy doubtless does something towards aggravating this condition. Such a complication should be treated on rational principles, but in the majority of instances, the in- flammation will subside spontaneously on the removal of the offending body. Water dressing to the wound, and a warm, moist atmosphere, are the two esseutial points of practice to be followed after the removal of the cause, and, as a rule, convalescence speedily follows. Chloroform ought always to be administered in these cases when operative inter- ference is called for. Scald of the Larynx. This somewhat common accident is engendered amongst the poor (Edema of from the habit of feeding their children out of a teapot. The child, frora when thirsty and alone, being accustomed to drink from the “ spout,” ' tries the same experiment with the kettle of boiling water, and scalds the pharynx and orifice of the larynx so that cedematous inflammation of the part follows, in the same manner as a blister arises by the appli- cation of boiling water or steam to any other tissue. The symptoms caused by such an accident appeal’, as a rule, very speedily, the small chink of the glottis soon closes, and, as a consequence, a fatal result ensues unless early relief can be obtained. In some cases, the mouth, with the soft palate, tongue, and fauces. Symptoms, will be found swollen and vesicated. There will also be difficulty in swal- lowing, and some alteration in the character of the voice. The respira- tion rapidly becomes affected, and a spasmodic croupy cough appears, with stridulous breathing. These symptoms may become gradually or rapidly worse, and may be complicated with attacks of spasmodic dyspnoea, at long or short intervals ; but when these attacks appear, the condition is extremely dangerous, as any spasm may prove fatal. A somewhat similar result may arise from the intentional or accidental swallowing of any corrosive poison or acid, or from the inhalation of a flame. Treatment.—In a fair proportion of these cases little other treat- Treatment, ment than a warm bed, the application of a hot sponge to the larynx. Mild means, and the inhalation of warm moist air, is ever needed; the symptoms subside as rapidly as they appear, three or four days seeing the worst of the case; and, in these mild cases, the laryngeal symptoms are probably never severe. When laryngeal symptoms exist, accom- panied by spasm, the case assumes a threatening aspect; indeed, the first spasm may be the last. I have notes of the case of a child in whom the symptoms were so slight that no anxiety was felt, but a single spasm took place two hours and a half after the accident, and put an end to life. When symptoms are severe, the operation of tracheotomy should be Tracheotomy.26 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF LARYNX AND TRACHEA. Statistics of operations in these cases. On the epiglottome. Calomel.

On the laryngoscope. performed; indeed, I am disposed to recommend this operation in every case in which the symptoms are rapidly progressing, and laryngeal spasms coexist. To postpone it too long till the lungs become gorged with blood, and, consequently, disposed to inflammatory action, and the powers of the patient are depressed, is a timid and certainly unsuc- cessful practice. In the opinion of many good surgeons, I know it is thought desirable to postpone operative interference as long as possible—“ to watch and wait.” In this I do not agree. When laryngeal spasms exist with mechanical obstruction, nothing but opening the windpipe places the patient in safety. Out of nine cases consecutively treated by tracheotomy, five recovered. The statistics, however, of my colleague Mr. Durham are less favourable, twenty-three out of twenty- eight cases terminating fatally. In some instances, the scarification or puncturing of the cedematous opening of the larynx and epiglottis gives great relief. I have been accustomed to do this by means of an ordinary tenaculum or mounted needle. Mr. Tudor, formerly of the Dreadnought, has invented a useful instrument for the purpose, called an epiglottome. The punctures into the cedematous tissue may he free, and never seem to do harm. Drs. Wallace and Bevan, of Dublin, have spoken very strongly in favour of the calomel treatment, two or three grains being given every hour until the symptoms are relieved; and Dr. Croly uses inunction at the same time. Other surgeons speak well of antimony, and, doubtless, it is a drug that should always he given ; one, two, or three minims of the antimonial wine every quarter of an hour, until some effect has been made upon the disease, and then at longer intervals. The best local application to the larynx is the hot sponge. A blister over the upper part of the sternum sometimes does good, and, in exceptional cases, leeches to the larynx maybe used. The time all these remedies, however, require to produce their effects is too long, and their action too uncertain to allow the surgeon to depend upon them in acute cases; as accessories to the treatment they are of use, but as means of preventing death when obstruction exists and spasms are frequent, they are not to be recommended. When an operation is performed it should be tracheotomy. Laryngotomy is inapplicable and too near to the disease. Chloroform may be given without fear. Diseases of the Larynx requiring Tracheotomy. Since the introduction of the laryngoscope, our knowledge of the disease of the larynx has so much increased and the treatment of its different affections so much improved, that the subject has become somewhat extensive; so extensive, indeed, that enterprising members of our profession have contrived to turn it into a speciality. This is a subject of regret in a certain sense, as it tends to make the bulk of the profession, and with it the student, look upon laryngeal affections as difficult subjects of investigation and beyond the reach of average skill. This is not, however, in any way correct, for the use of the laryngoscope or throat speculum is no more difficult than that of any other instrument. To use it neatly and efficiently requires skill and some practice, but the same efforts are also essential to every other surgical investigation. The first laryngoscope was introduced to the profession in 1829 by the late Dr. B. G. Babington, who, under the term “ glottiscope,”DISEASES OE THROAT REQUIRING TRACHEOTOMY. 27 invented an instrument composed of a mirror fixed to a wire handle, which, being fixed against the palate whilst the tongue was de- pressed, enabled him to view the upper part of the larynx. Garcia, the singer, in 1855 gave an impulse to the idea by throwing the sun’s rays into the hack of his mouth by means of a mirror held in his left hand; and so from a dentist’s reflector introduced into his mouth he could witness the movements of his larynx in the looking- glass. But to Drs. Czermak and Turck are unquestionably due the credit of having applied this mode of investigation in a scientific way to the diagnosis of laryngeal disease. They employed, however, artificial illumination instead of solar, adopting the practice of Helmholtz in ophthalmoscopic operations. The ordinary mode of application of the instrument is very simple. Mode of use. The patient sits with his hack to a good light, that of the sun is the best, but a moderator or gas lamp will suffice. The lamp should he in a line with the patient’s face, and on his right side ; the surgeon, with the mirror fastened round his head, faces the light and reflects it on the patient. The patient is then directed to open his mouth, protrude Fig. 313. his tongue, and hold it with a handkerchief: a warmed mirror is then introduced to the back of the fauces, while the tongue at this time is depressed. The rays of light from the frontal mirror are then made to fal upon the pharyngeal, and, with a little arrangement, the glottis and aH the parts around, above or below, may be carefully examined Ihe pharyngeal mirror may also be well illuminated by simply pro- jecting the rays of light from a large reflector fastened behind a gas or moderator lamp, as seen in Pig. 313.

It is impossible in the following chapter to give a full descrip- tion of all the different affections to which the larynx is liable, nor would it be consistent with the object I have in view, since laryngeal affections come as much under the notice of the physician as the surgeon, and the latter is only consulted when medicine has failed to relieve symptoms and evidence exists of some progressive affection which by causing obstruction to the respiratory process, threatens life. In the following chapter I propose, therefore, to consider the diseases of the larynx in their surgical aspect only, and to view them simply in their relation to tracheotomy or other operative interference. In a general way it may be asserted, that tracheotomy may be called for under any circumstances in which obstruction exists to the respi- ratory act, mechanical or otherwise, such as in pharyngeal affections mechanically affecting the larynx ; in laryngeal disease acute or chronic, inflammatory or otherwise; or in tumours pressing from without upon the windpipe in some part of its course. It may also he possibly re- quired for some temporary purpose connected with operative surgery, to insure the maintenance of the respiratory act during the removal of a large pharyngeal or maxillary tumour. Pharyngeal affections obstructing the respiration. Abscesses about the pharynx or tonsils at times cause laryngeal obstruction, and such a complication should be treated by puncturing the abscess with a guarded bistoury. Inflammatory and ulcerating affec- tions of the throat, more particularly those called diphtheritic, are apt to spread to the larynx and set up a laryngitis. Indeed, Trousseau asserts, that in most cases croup begins in the pharynx. Tumours of the pharynx or tonsils are occasionally met with, pressing upon the larynx and interfering with its functions, or a cyst may develope at the back of the tongue behind the epiglottis, and, by its size, almost close the laryngeal orifice; or a naso-pharyngeal tumour may so press downwards as not only to threaten life by suffocation, but to cause death. In a large naso-pharyngeal tumour I had to treat, the former condition was met with, hut relief was given by the removal of the growth. In another case, one of cancerous tumour of the pharynx above the soft palate occurring in a boy, set. 18, and which I’apidly recurred after its removal, death ensued from suffocation, tracheotomy having been rejected. Suffocation from simple enlarge- ment of the tonsils I believe to he unknown, although it has occurred from cancerous disease. Affections of the larynx requiring tracheotomy. Inflammatory affections can never exist long without causing some closure of the glottis, thereby endangering life. In acute laryngitis of catarrhal origin, in membranous croup, and in diphtheritic croup, a few hours may be sufficient to produce this effect, either from oedema of the larynx, suppuration of the larynx, or the effusion of a false membrane. In all, the result is the same, mechanical closure of the glottis complicated with spasm; and in all, the important question presents itself as to whether medical treatment can he sufficient to check the disease, or surgical aid in the way of operative interference is re- quired. Trousseau, our great authority in this matter of tracheotomy in croup, maintained strongly, that the earlier the operation is per- formed the greater are the chances of success; that it ought to be performed before death is imminent; and that to whatever degreeDISEASES OF THROAT REQUIRING TRACHEOTOMY. 29 asphyxia may have proceeded, it ought to be tried; for in the most desperate cases there is a chance of success, provided the local lesion, the croup, constitutes the chief danger of the disease. In these views I entirely concur ; they are physiologically sound and clinically correct. Indeed, the operation should be performed in all cases when the disease is steadily progressing, when it is unaffected by medical treat- ment, and before asphyxia, carbonsemia, or severe blood poisoning has taken place; the chances of success under these circumstances being hopeful; as it seems to be a clinical fact that in a large number of such cases the extension of disease is arrested by the operation. When the lungs, however, have become gorged with blood unfit for circulation by too protracted delay in operating, a successful issue can hardly be looked for. In chronic laryngitis, whether tubercular, syphilitic, or otherwise. Tracheotomy tracheotomy may be required to prevent impending death or as a means in chronic of cure. For the first indication it should not be postponed too long, 'nryng'1*8- for “ too long ” often means “ too late,” some spasmodic attack carrying off the patient. When these attacks consequently appear and recur, tracheotomy should be performed. Tracheotomy as a means of cure is not sufficiently practised. “ It Tracheotomy has been hitherto generally performed in the class of cases to which I a8cauJ.”ealls have just alluded—to rescue patients from the danger of impending 0 curc' suffocation, and to prolong life when threatened from laryngeal disease; and yet it must have struck most men, when watching cases which have been operated upon under these circumstances, how rapidly all laryngeal symptoms disappear and ulcerative action undergoes a re- parative process, both in the pharynx and larynx, after a new passage has been obtained for the respiratory act, and complete quiescence of the parts has been secured by means of tracheotomy.” I have a strong Early opinion, therefore, that it would be wise to perform the operation operation in ulcerative laryngeal affections at an earlier period than has hitherto advisei1- been practised, with a view of arresting the progress of the disease, and probably of saving the larynx as a respiratory and vocal organ, anticipating the time when the operation may be demanded for the purpose of preventing impending suffocation. In the first volume of the * Clinical Society’s Transactions ’ I have published some cases illustrative of these views, and my more recent experience has con- firmed them. It should not be performed in the very early period of the disease, whilst any reasonable hope exists that by medical or local treatment a successful result may be secured; but it should he undertaken in all cases of progressive disease, when local and general treatment have failed to make any impression on the local affection. Tumours of the larynx are not very uncommon. Children are liable Tumours of to suffer from warty growths of the rima or the surrounding parts, and tlie lar)'nx in adults, epithelial tumours are likewise met with. Cancerous growths, involving the larynx, are also on record. Mr. Holmes, in his admirable work ‘On Children’s Diseases,’ informs us that out of twenty-eight cases of tumour of the larynx, which he tabulated from the ‘ Transactions of the Pathological Society,’ seven were cancerous. He also points out the fact, that in cases of tumours of this region, life is threatened by the occasional fits of spasmodic dyspnoea, the patient being often well in the intervals, and, when these recur very severely, it becomes necessary to perform tracheotomy.30 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF LARYNX AND TRACHEA. When warty growths exist, and it is impossible to remove them from above by means of the forceps, or snare, aided by the laryngoscope, the larynx may be laid open fearlessly in the middle line and the tumour re- moved. I did this in 1871, in a child, ait. 3, for extensive warty disease of the epiglottis and glottis with complete success; and my colleagues Mr. Durham and Mr. Davies Colley have done the same. I have also, by the operation of tracheotomy, prolonged for many months, the life of a man who had a cancerous laryngeal tumour obstructing respiration. Tracheotomy may also be required for tumours of the neck pressing upon the larynx. I have been called upon to operate under these cir- cumstances on three occasions; also for intrathoracic tumours, aneu- rismal or otherwise, the operation in both cases being demanded for sudden laryngeal spasm, due either to pressure on the recurrent laryn- geal nerve, or to compression of the trachea, Dr. Bristowe having well shown (‘ St. Thomas’s Hosp. Rep.,’ vol. iii, 1872) “ that destruction of the functional activity of one recurrent laryngeal nerve is marked by paralysis of the corresponding vocal cord, which can be recognised by means of the laryngoscope, by impairment of the musical quality of the voice, and (probably) by some difficulty of swallowing, owing to the tendency of food to slip into the larynx, but is not necessarily attended with stridor or dyspnoea; and, in the second place, that compression of the trachea involves stridor and difficulty of breathing, which is often paroxysmal and liable to end in sudden death, but that it does not of itself interfere with perfect intonation, excepting only in so far as it may render the voice weak by diminishing the supply of wind to the vocal organs.” Excision of the Larynx. This operation was first performed by Billroth, of Vienna, in 1873, for cancerous disease in a man; and Heine, of Prague, Moriz Schmidt, of Frankfort-on-the-Maine, and Langenbeck, of Berlin, have followed his practice, but the success that has attended it is not such as to lead me to recommend the operation. The operation can be performed by making a transverse incision parallel to and above the hyoid bone, and a vertical one at a right angle to it over the larynx, the dissection of the larynx being made from above. Dr. Foulis, of Glasgow, has, how- ever, recently performed this operation upon a man set. 28, for recur- rent papillary sarcoma, with singular success. In the operation he left the epiglottis.

In all these operation. operations the objects are the same, either to admit air into the lungs when some obstruction exists in or above the larynx, or to facilitate the removal of a foreign body or morbid growth. Dismissing the general term “bronchotomy” from otu' consideration, the two latter operations claim our notice, and are applicable in two different classes of cases. When the cause of obstruction is above the larynx, laryngotomy may be performed; when in the larynx, tracheotomy or laryngo-tracheotomy should always be preferred. For the removal of a foreign body or new growth, tracheotomy is the better operation, the incision at times beingBROSTCHOTOMY, TRACHEOTOMY, LARYNGOTOMY. 31 extended upwards into the larynx, either through the cricoid and thy- roid cartilages or downwards as far as needed. For both operations chloroform may be safely administered, unless asphyxia be profound, when it is not required. Laryngotomy is not an operation to be performed on children, the Laryngo- crico-thyroid space at an early period of life being too small to allow tomy- of a free opening being made into it. It is only applicable in adults ^as®s when obstruction to respiration exists above the rima glottidis, such as lca 1 e' that caused by an impacted mass of food, or some pharyngeal growth. For tetanus or any other spasmodic affection of the larynx threatening life, it may likewise be employed, as well as in operations on the palate, pharynx, &c., in which it is advisable to ensure the free passage of air into the lungs during manipulation ; although under these latter cir- cumstances tracheotomy and the use of Dr. Trendelenburg’s plug is to be preferred (Fig. 205, vol. i). To perform the operation, the patient should be placed on the back Mode of with the thorax raised, shoulders drawn down, and head extended. The performance, operator should stand on the patient’s right side, and feel for the thy- roid cartilage, at the lower border of which the windpipe is to be opened. To do this, a vertical incision is to be made in the median line, about one inch long, cutting through all the tissues covering iu the crico-tliyroid membrane. The membrane should then he opened transversely with a knife. The crico-thyroid arteries cross this space, and may possibly be divided giving rise to some little haemorrhage. Sir W. Fergusson has recorded a case narrated to him by Professor Turner, of Edinburgh, in which a fatal haemorrhage occurred from these vessels. Tracheotomy is by no means a simple operation, but under all On circumstances is delicate, requiring coolness and caution, and when tracheotomy. Eiq. 314.

Use of canula. 32 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF LARYNX AND TRACHEA. performed hurriedly, is too often made difficult and even dangerous. In very young children it is always troublesome. The surgeon may at times be called upon to be rapid in his movements, but never should be hurried. As the result of hurry many are the mistakes that might be enumerated, such as wounding of the innominate or carotid artery; the opening of the oesophagus through the trachea; the punc- turing of the spine through both these tubes, &c. The patient should be placed as in laryngotomy, while the surgeon stands on the right side. The different points in the neck must then be made out, and the existence of any large vein in the line of incision looked for, and, if present, avoided. The best position for opening the trachea is half an inch below the cricoid cartilage or below the isthmus of the thyroid gland; but this is not a point of so much importance as some surgeons would lead us to suppose. In infants it may be disre- garded. An incision about two inches long may then be made through all the soft parts covering the trachea. This may be done rapidly when needed, deliberately when possible, care being taken at the same time, by means of retractors, not to displace the parts. During this step of the operation the surgeon’s left index-finger should be his guide ; and it should be steadily kept over the trachea till the rings are felt, while it will also intimate the presence of any arteries near the tube or in the line of incision. The rings once recognised, the trachea may be opened with the knife, its edge being turned upwards, and the opening made parallel with the nail of the left index-finger, which is in the wound. When the windpipe has been opened, air, blood, and mucus will at once bubble up. The canula with its pilot should then be introduced into the trachea through the opening which the left index-finger has covered, this finger acting all through as a guide and director, and, lastly, as a plug to the wound till the canula has been introduced. The eye of the operator should be directed to the end of his left index- finger. In opening the trachea, some prefer to use the hook to draw it forward, and in cases in which much bleediug exists, or the trachea is very deep, it may be employed. I have, however, rarely used it, having more confidence in the use of the left index finger as a guide throughout. Some employ also a dilator to keep the wound open till the tube is introduced, while others prefer to open the trachea with a sharp trocar. The former practice is unnecessary, and the latter dan- gerous ; as a sharp trocar may perforate the trachea altogether and enter the oesophagus, an accident I have known to occur, or if it slip by the side of the windpipe the large vessels will be endangered. With respect to the canula, Fuller’s bi-valve has hitherto met with general approval, and Durham’s “ lobster-tail ” canula (Fig. 315) has Fig. 315. Durham’s canula and pilot.33 TRACHEOTOMY. been much liked; though the best by far is the ball-and-socket instru- ment (Pig. 316) I had made some years ago—its great advantage consisting in the mobility of the tube with the trachea, the neck plate being fixed. The rigid tube when required to be worn for long, too often excites ulceration by the pressure of its free end on the trachea, which may extend into the innominate artery. Mr. Morant Baker has re- cently introduced into practice a tube made of vulcanised red india rubber, which seems to answer well, and may be employed on the second or third day after the operation has been performed. Every metal canula should be double, and every canula fixed iu position by a piece of silk or tape passed through the shield and fastened round the nape of the neck. Fig. 316. After the operation, the atmosphere of the room should be kept warm After- and moist by the admission of steam, care being taken that the air is not treatment , saturated with vapour. The wound ought to be kept clean; strapping and sutures are rarely required; water dressing or sweet oil being pro- bably the best local applications. Great care should be observed to keep the orifice of the canula free from mucus and the inner tube clean. A piece of muslin should be placed over the tube to prevent the entrance of foreign bodies. Complications.—If the operation should be complicated by haemor- Complica- rhage the surgeon must not be alarmed. When arterial, it must be ar- tions. rested before the trachea is opened, either by the application of a ligature or by torsion ; if venous, the sooner the trachea is opened the better, for a few good inspirations do more to relieve the venous congestion, which is almost always present when tracheotomy is demanded, than any other attempt to check bleeding. As soon as the tube has been introduced, the patient may be rolled over on his side, to allow the blood to run away from the tracheal wound. A piece of sponge applied with some pressure over the wound is generally enough to arrest all venous bleeding, unless some large venous trunk has been opened. I have never known haemorrhage of this kind to be so copious as to in- terfere with the operation, or to be so persistent as not to cease readily on its completion. If the surgeon stops his operation till bleeding has ceased, he will too often wait till the necessity of the operation with the life of his patient has passed away. Opening of the trachea.—Tuere can be little doubt, that in patients On the after puberty, the trachea should generally be opened below the isthmus opening of of the thyroid gland, but in infants and young children where the ‘he trachea trachea is deeply placed and the neck fat and short, the nearer the m mfants- opening is to the cricoid cartilage the better. For several years I have VOL. ii. ' 334 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF LARYNX AND TRACHEA. Size of tube. . Artificial respiration. Removal of the canula. Causes of non-re-esta- blishment of respiration. been in tbe habit of opening the trachea immediately below the cricoid ring, and never have hesitated to divide the latter when more room is required. In many instances, I have gone through the isthmus of the thyroid, and never had any reason to regret it j nay, I am almost tempted to believe that the dangers of its division are really theoretical and practically may be disregarded. Of this I am con- vinced, that the nearer the tracheal opening is to the lower border of the cricoid ring, the better is the operation. If the opening be too small at the first puncture, a second should be made rather than grope about with retractors and instruments to find the original opening. The tracheal tube need not be very large, for Mr. Marsh has demon- strated (‘ St. Barth. Hosp. Report/ vol. iii) that while the cricoid car- tilage is the smallest part of the air-tube, the rima glottidis is smaller. Under all circumstances, the operation should be completed, and, even in apparently hopeless cases, artificial respiration should be kept up through the wound. Mr. Holmes has recorded a case of Mr. Tatum’s in which it was maintained for two hours with ultimate success. When tracheotomy has been performed for thyroidal tumours press- ing upon the trachea, the surgeon should have at hand a long perforated tube, small enough to be introduced through the canula, as the tumour may so overlap the trachea as to cause obstruction below the point at which the operation is performed. For the want of such an instrument, I lost a patient whom I saw with Dr. Risdon Bennett, while hy its aid, I was enabled to save another for several days, the elastic tube being pressed through the canula, past the obstruction, into the lungs. I have had such a tube adapted to my canula as a pilot to introduce it. It is almost needless to say, that the canula should be removed from the trachea as soon as respiration has been re-established by tbe natural passage, and that it should on no account be left in more than three months. When required longer, a new one should be substituted, since the canula rapidly undergoes oxidization in the trachea and becomes liable to break. In a patient of my own, where the tube had been worn six months, half its circumference close to the neck shield had been destroyed, and the slightest violence would have broken tbe instrument in the trachea. The vulcanite canula is good for constant use. Mr. T. Smith, in an excellent paper (‘Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1865), has given a good summary of the obstacles to the re-establishment of natural respiration after tracheotomy, and he has shown, that the chief causes are a narrowing of the passage of the larynx by granulations around the canula, and the impairment or loss of those functions of the muscles of the larynx which regulate the admission of air through the rima. There may, likewise, be a persistence of tbe original cause which necessitated the performance of the operation, the effects of the original disease, or the closure of the vocal cords from the cicatrization of old ulceration. In three cases now under my observation in which tracheotomy has been performed for chronic ulceration of the larynx, the rima has so contracted as to be impervious in two, and in one, the opening is so small as to be insufficient for respiration, although enough for speaking purposes. To help the surgeon to judge of the patency of the glottis, Luer has invented a bullet valve to be adapted to the orifice of the canula; and Mr. T. Smith an india-rubber one which seems equally efficient, and isFRACTURED RIBS. 35 a simpler instrument. Either may be employed, as anything that How to judge helps to decide when the canula may be removed with safety is of ™ t“°cy of value. Uie glottis. CHAPTER XIX. SURGERY OF THE CHEST. Contusions. The chest is liable to be contused, and severe contusions are not un- Contusion, frequently followed by extensive effusions of blood. The swelling under these circumstances occurs suddenly after the injury, and appears with the discoloration of a bruise. These cases, as a rule, do well if left alone, the extravasated blood becoming absorbed, but, in exceptional examples, the blood may break down and give rise to suppuration. Treatment.—When the contusion is slight, the application of a cold Treatment, lead lotion is all that is necessary, and in more severe examples where extravasation is great, there is nothing equal to the application of a bag of ice. In obstinate cases, the use of some stimulating liniment hastens recovery, and the administration of tonics is always of value. When the effused blood breaks down and suppuration ensues, the abscess must be opened, but the surgeon need be in no hurry to con- clude that the effused blood is incapable of being absorbed nor that pus has formed, since it is a familiar fact that blood may remain fluid in the tissues for a long period and yet be eventually removed by absorption. Rupture of the Pectoral Muscle is an accident which may take place from a forcible strain applied Ruptured to the muscle unprepared for action or from external violence. I have muscles, seen a case in which the muscle was nearly torn across about its centre, from the forcible drawing back of the arm, in which the fingers could be inserted between the divided ends of the torn muscle, and there was much effusion of blood. In it the arm was bound to the side by a bandage and ice locally applied, and three months subsequently, some power existed in the muscle. The amount of repair which is to be expected in these cases depends upon the severity of the injury, and the care with which the parts are kept in position during its progress. As a general rule, the two ends of the divided muscle should be kept in contact for at least two months before movement is allowed. This accident is not rare in children from forcible dragging of the arm. Fractured Ribs form about a tenth part of the cases of fracture admitted into a large On fraclnrea hospital. This accident is less common in children and young adults than ribs- in subjects past middle age, on account of the elasticity of the ribs. In the aged the ribs become so brittle that they break under slight external violence, and in rare cases from the violence of a cough. I have seen this occur in two patients, the one a male and the other a female, between sixty and seventy years of age, in whom no signs of disease existed, and both are now alive.SURGERY OF THE CHEST. 3 6 In lunatic asylums. Causes— direct and indirect. Varieties. Compli- cations. Prognosis of fractured ribs. In the old and asthmatic. Dangers of complicated fracture. Fractured ribs are not uncommon accidents in lunatic asylums, and generally arise from direct violence; though it would be wrong to assume that they are always the result of ill-treatment, as patients when much excited, will inflict unconsciously most serious injuries on themselves, and it has been proved that the bones of many of the insane are in an abnormally brittle state. This is especially true in the dis- ease known as “ general paralysis of the insane.” Dr. Campbell Brown, of Liverpool, has analysed the ribs of general paralytics, and states that “ the ratio of organic constituents to earthy matters is much greater, while the ratio of lime to phosphoric acid is distinctly less, in the ribs of paralytics than in those of healthy adults. There are the same differences between the composition of healthy ribs and those of paralytics as between the composition of the adult large bones and those of the fmtus. And generally the composition in cases of paralysis approaches that observed in cases of osteo-malacia.” Some striking cases bearing on this subject are recorded by Dr. Hearder in the ‘ Journ. of Mental Sci.’ for 1871. In the majority of cases, the injury being the result of direct violence, the fracture takes place at the part struck, and so the ribs are often driven in. In the minority, where it is due to indirect violence such as that caused by a crush or squeeze, the ribs generally give way about their middle, and three or more become injured, both sides being not unfrequently involved. When the bones are merely broken, it is called a simple fracture; but when complicated with a wound commu- nicating with the fracture, compound. When the ends of the broken ribs are driven inwards, the pleura costalis or the lung itself may be torn, and the heart or pericardium or abdominal viscera injured. In an analysis of 136 consecutive cases which I made when registrar at Guy’s, 108 were uncomplicated and twenty-eight com- plicated fractures, six of which died at once from fatal collapse. Of the former, eight only had secondary inflammation, whilst of the latter, sixteen were complicated with emphysema, three with emphy- sema and haemoptysis, and three with extensive injury to the lung and secondary inflammatory symptoms. All these recovered, except two that died from old-standing disease. When a rib is broken, the serous lining of the chest, the pleura cos- talis, is probably injured, and the danger of the accident lies in the secondary inflammation—pleuritis—which may follow ; and this oc- curred in eight of the 108 cases just alluded to. When the lung is injured, as indicated by emphysema or haemoptysis, pneumonia, which happens in about seven out of every twenty-two cases, is the danger to be feared. Cases that die from fatal collapse after the accident generally do so from haemorrhage due to extensive laceration of the thoracic or abdominal viscera. In gunshot fractures, a portion of the ribs may be detached and driven into the lung. Simple fracture is a serious accident only in subjects who are the vic- tims of some chronic chest affection, when, from the broken ribs rendering it impossible for the patients to expectorate, asphyxia is favoured. Fractures complicated with injury to the lung are, however, more serious. When severe, they are directly dangerous from the shock to the system and the haemorrhage that frequently attends them ; and indirectly so from the fact that the slightest lung woundFRACTURED RIBS. 87 is liable to be followed by inflammation of the lung itself or of the pleura. Fractured ribs generally unite in about a month; and where they Period have not been kept quiet, considerable callus may be thrown out, or required for a false joint formed. repair. Diagnosis.—Pain at the seat of injury, associated with a peculiar Diagnosis, catch in the breath of the patient and the general avoidance of any- thing like a full inspiration, are somewhat characteristic symptoms of a fractured rib, more especially when they show themselves at once after direct or indirect violence. At times, too, the patient will complain of a grating in the part, and, on the application of the hand over the seat of injury, if the patient be made to cough, crepitus will be felt— Crepitus, this crepitus being caused by the friction of the ends of the broken bone. When the seat of fracture is beneath a thick layer of muscles or fat, this symptom may, however, escape detection; nor should it be too closely sought after when others indicate the nature of the injury, as the manipulation required to elicit this sign is sometimes consider- able, and any approach to violence or over-manipulation is always injurious. When emphysema complicates the case as indicated by a more or Emphysema, less diffused puffy swelling which crackles on pressure, there will be no doubt as to the lung having been injured, since this symptom is caused by the escape of air from the lung into the cellular tissue about the seat of fracture. This may be either local or general; when associated with hcemoptysis, it is fair to infer that the lung has been penetrated ; fliemoptysis. the severity of the mischief being gauged by the extent of the em- physema and the amount of the haemoptysis. Treatment.—The object of the surgeon in the treatment of a Treatment, simple fracture of the thorax is, to maintain the ribs at rest, which should be effected by the application of strips of strong adhesive Strapping, plaster two inches broad, extending from the sternum to the spine, and from at least three inches above to three inches below the seat of injury, each strip being applied so as to cover half of that which preceded it (Fig. 317). By this method, the movements of the broken ribs are restrained without those of the opposite side being interfered with. It is, moreover, both in comfort and efficiency, far superior to the old method of encir- cling the chest with a flannel roller; in- deed, it generally affords speedy relief to all symptoms. When the case is compli- cated with emphysema or even haemoptysis the same treatment should be carried out, for in these more severe cases the neces- sity of maintaining the immobility of the ribs is just as necessary as in the less severe. In rare cases in which much displacement has occurred, a sheet of felt or gutta percha made soft by hot water and moulded to the part Gutta perclm is of great value, the mould being subsequently fixed by strapping as described. The patient should be kept quiet, though not necessarily in bed. Rest. Fig. 317. Bandage. Strapping in fracture of ribs.38 SURGERY OF THE CHEST. Sedatives. Antimony. Example. Utility of venesection and abundance of bland, nutritious, but unstimulating food given, with sedatives, if required; of tbe latter chloral in half-drachm doses is probably the best, though morphia or Dover’s powder are also good. When cough or any symptoms of inflammation of the pleura or lungs appear, antimonial wine in doses of thirty minims for an adult every four or six hours in some saline mixture, is a most valuable remedy. When chest complications are severe, and orthopncea with a sense of suffocation from pulmonary congestion threatens life, venesection should be practised. Local treatment was sufficient in 100 of the 136 cases above mentioned. In a case of severe injury to the chest caused by the passage over it of the wheels of a heavily laden cart, that came under my care some time ago, fracture of five or six ribs and dislocation of the clavicle occurred, associated with collapse, intense dyspnoea, and haemoptysis; I bled the patient twice in twelve hours, and each time with imme- diate relief, the case going on to a good recovery. In it the severe dyspnoea and venous congestion, the rapid and hard pulse that came on as soon as the collapse of the accident had passed away and the circulation had been restored, too surely pointed to an excessive en- gorgement of the lungs, and so if relief were not afforded, absolute suffo- cation would speedily ensue by the patient’s own highly carbonised blood. At such a crisis, antimsny, however beneficial in simpler cases, could not be trusted, as there was no time for it to take effect. Under these circumstances bleeding was performed, and, as the blood flowed, life seemed gradually to return ; the laborious breathing became quiet and subdued; the deadened and congested eye, bright and natural; the pulse from being full and hard, softer and less bounding; and the boy’s feelings, released from the impression that death was nigh at hand, be- came more hopeful and resigned; and, as a spectator, I felt such a hope was valid, and that success might crown our efforts. After the lapse of twelve hours, however, the symptoms returned, and the repetition of the bleeding was followed by a repetition of all its benefits. The antimony then came in to complete the cure; by tbe double venesec- tion, the pulmonary vessels had been relieved of their congestion, while the antimony, in acting upon the circulation, perfected the cure by preventing a return of the former threatening symptoms. The bene- fits arising from the treatment adopted in this case have such a lasting hold on my memory that I cannot too strongly recommend the prac- tice thus pursued, and the more so, as I have seen it equally successful in other cases. Bleeding is now rarely performed; and at Guy’s Hospital I believe it is rarer than any capital operation. In the case of lace- rated lung, however, when urgent dyspnoea makes its appearance and the powers of the patient do not forbid it, I know of nothing which gives greater relief to the patient or greater pleasure to the prac- titioner. Bleed with no sparing hand; letting it flow freely in a full stream, and as it flows, the symptoms will gradually disappear. When relief has been obtained, arrest the flow immediately, as syncope can only do harm. The aim should be to make an impression through the systemic circulation upon the pulmonary. The patient should be carefully watched, and the operation repeated if the symptoms return, and, if necessary, even for a third time. The antimonial treatment, however, must not be neglected. The object of the bleeding is to relieveWOUNDS OF CHEST. immediate symptoms and to give time for the antimony to take effect, because when the patient has been brought fully under its influence, all danger may be said to have disappeared; few patients die from secondary inflammation of the lungs when once fairly under the in- fluence of antimony. Fracture of the sterno-costal cartilages is a rare accident. 1 have Fracture of seen but two cases, and in one of the seventh rib, which had resulted ^[®t8|ern0‘ from a direct blow, a false joint existed. These which are said to cartilages, unite generally by bone can be treated in the same way as fractured ribs. Dislocation and fracture of the sternum are likewise rare accidents, Dislocation and the majority of them are complicated with other injuries, such as those of the head and spine—this condition having been found in 1 11 four out of fifty-six fatal cases of injury to the spine at Guy’s Hospital probably from the violent descent of the chin against the manubrium. It is occasionally met with also as a complication of fractured ribs. When fracture takes place, it is generally transverse and oblique from before backwards, the lower fragment being found projecting, only rare examples existing of a vertical fissure. When the upper portion of bone is displaced, it is generally displaced backwards; Rivington, in an able paper (‘Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1874), has fairly shown that displacement occurs in preference to fracture when an arthrodial joint exists between the manubrium and gladiolus. When deformity is pre- sent from displacement of bones, the diagnosis is easy, and when this Diagnosis, does not exist, pain in the part, aggravated by a full inspiration and crepitus on the application of the hand are the chief symptoms. The treatment must be the same as for fractured ribs, such as the recumbent Treatment, position and strapping over the part, complications being dealt with as they arise. Dislocation of the ribs requires notice, although little can be said Dislocaton about the subject. It is rarely if ever an accident per se, and when it of ril)S- occurs, it is part of a more severe one, such as fracture of the spine, or complicated fracture of the ribs. The same remarks apply to disloca- tion of the ribs from the cartilages, and the cartilages from the sternum. Practically all these cases should be dealt with like fractures. Wounds of the Chest. Wounds, of The main point to be determined in such cases as these is, whether cllest- the wound is superficial or has penetrated the pleura; for if the former Nou- obtains, slight cause for anxiety exists, but if the latter, the accident is penetrating gru.ve« wounds. When the wound is penetrating, the extent of the penetration Penctr«tiu>' and the organ penetrated has to be determined. Is the pleura alone wounds of" wounded—a rare injury—or is the lung involved ? Is the heart injured, cl,est- or any of the great vessels—the intercostal or internal mammary artery ? Many of these points can only be determined by a knowledge of the kind of weapon employed, its subsequent appearance, the direction of the force, and the anatomical knowledge of the surgeon; and, even then the difficulties of these cases are often great, as witnessed in a recent memorable trial (Flora Davy). When emphysema and hremoptysis are present, they may be accepted as clear indications of a wounded lung. Emphysema alone is always a suspicious symptom, though it may occur to s. mptoms a limited extent in non-penetrating punctured wounds that traverse the '40 SURGERY OF THE CHEST. as con- soft tissues outside the thorax; while the absence of haemoptysis is no proof that the lung has escaped injury. When blood and air bubble through the wound and air passes freely from it, or a portion of lung protrudes, there is no room for doubt as to the nature of the injury; but these cases are exceptional. In the majority, the diagnosis is ever uncertain, since there are no definite individual symptoms by which in- jury to the lung is to he diagnosed. The surgeon in his anxiety to wound Pr°l)e ma*ie out point must never be induced to probe the wound, or to explore it with a finger; nor should he test the condition of the lung by making his patient cough to expel air through the thoracic opening. Indeed, he should throw aside all direct or manipulative modes of investigation, and trust to the indirect. The direct effects of a penetrating wound are, haemorrhage into the chest or haemo-thorax, emphysema, pneumo-thorax, and hernia of the lung. The secondary results are those of inflammation such pleurisy or pneumonia, hydro-thorax, or empyema, with their sequences. The prognosis is always unfavourable, and should be guarded, more particularly when the wound is penetrating; hut, when a week has passed without any unfavorable symptoms appealing, a more promising and decided tone may be assumed. Treatment.—In all suspected or obvious penetrating chest wounds, the utmost gentleness should be employed, and complete quiet en- forced; as any deviation from this practice may disturb nature’s reparative process, disarrange clot, and excite over-action or inflamma- tion. The external wound should be carefully cleaned and closed, and all foreign bodies removed. The patient should be placed in the re- cumbent position, and on no account allowed to stir. He should be fed on the simplest nutritious food, and which for the first two or three days should be cold, while ice and milk is without doubt the best mixture. The collapse which often follows the injury need not excite alarm unless it be protracted or severe, for when the result of haemorrhage it is not only a salutary measure, but the only means the surgeon looks to for the arrest of haemorrhage, as he himself is powerless to interfere. If blood, however, accumulates in the chest and by its mechanical pressure threaten life, some means must be found for its evacuation, either through the original wound or by the operation of tapping, or by an incision of tbe thorax. The indications should be very decided before the surgeon interferes, as the extravasated blood rapidly coagu- lates and consequently is difficult to remove. The same remarks hold good when air accumulates or is pent up in the pleural cavity. The symptoms that attend reaction should be carefully watched, and anything like excess of action, as indicated by increased difficulty in respiration, cough, or a rapid pulse, ought to be met by the administra- tion of antimony in half-drachm doses of the wine with some saline every three or four hours. If the lungs become gorged with blood and asphyxia threatens, vene- section is as valuable a remedy in these cases as it has been shown to be in those of fractured ribs.

Venesection.41 WOUNDS OP THE CHEST. Hernia of the lung or pneumocele is a rare consequence of a puuc- Hernia of turecl wound of the thorax. I have seen but one example where the tumour was on the left side, external to the nipple, and about the size of a walnut. The mass was left in sitii and gradually withered. When the hernia is recent, however, and the lung healthy, its reduction is generally considered to be the best practice, but when of long standing and diseased it had better be left alone. Its removal by liga- ture or the knife has likewise been recommended, successful cases having been recorded of all forms of practice. In a case which came under my care at Guy’s in 1876, of fracture of the'sternal ends of the left third and fourth ribs, by the man falling upon the blunt end of some wooden palings, in which the bones were driven in without wounding the integuments, a hernia of the lung took place the size of a duck’s egg, but an excellent recovery followed the reduction of the hernia and the persistent application of pressure. Velpeau has recorded an instance of Example, hernia of the lung following the healing of a wound. The tumour in such a case is covered with integument, and is called the consecutive variety of hernia. In such a case, all that can be done, is to protect the lung from injury by a shield. Laceration of the lung without fracture of the ribs is an accident of Lacerated occasional occurrence, and I have recorded an instance in ‘ Guy’s Reports ’ for 1860, arising from extreme pressure upon the elastic rii,g ribs of a boy, set. 7. Poland also, in his excellent article on the chest in ‘ Holmes’s Surgery,’ has quoted several others. M. Gosselin’s explanation of its cause is probably correct, viz. “ that at the time of the injury, when the chest sustains the violence, the lungs are sud- denly tilled and distended with air by a full inspiration, and the air, prevented from escaping by occlusion of the larynx, thus becomes pent up in the lung tissue, and the lung, not being able to recede from the superincumbent pressure, its tissue necessarily gives way.” The symptoms of this injury are much the same as have beeu mentioned in the paragraph on wounds of the lung, while the treatment must be similar. Severe compression of the chest may likewise cause laceration of the Compression heart or large vessels; also brain symptoms such as unconsciousness, °fllle chest, epistaxis, and haemorrhage into the orbit beneath the conjunctiva and eyelids; and, in a singular case which I recorded in the same volume of the ‘Guy’s Rep.’ as that of the boy just quoted, paralysis of the muscles of deglutition and of the larnyx, which lasted for two days. Abscesses are frequently found about the chest, and when situated Abscesses beneath the pectoral muscles are very obstinate. They may be confined about the to the cellular tissue of the part and connected with the subpectoral cliest' glands, or associated with ruptured muscle or inflammation of the periosteum or bone. When connected with the muscles, they must be opened and the parts kept quiet by binding the arm to which the muscle belongs to the side, as each movement of the muscle retards recovery. When due to periostitis or ostitis, they are frequently syphilitic, and are more commonly situated over the sterum, though any of the ribs may be affected. Under these circumstances, constitutional treat- ment is essential, and the iodide of potassium in gradually increasin0, doses from five to ten grains in some tonic, such as bark,' is the bes't,42 SURGERY OF THE CHEST. Tumours of chest. Deformities of chest. Pigeon breast. Thoracen- tesis. In pneumo thorax. In licemo thorax. In hydro- thorax medicine. If the boue dies (necrosis) the dead portion must he re- moved when nature proves herself incompetent to throw off the sequestrum. When sinuses exist about the thorax, the surgeon should always he alive to the fact that they may be due either to an empyema which has naturally discharged itself, or, to a substernal abscess which is making its way through the intercostal spaces. The history of the case will be found to he the only correct clue to the diagnosis. In both instances, a free opening into the abscess and the washing out of its cavity is required. Tumours of the chest are not uncommon, but come more under the notice of the physician. Malignant and other tumours, however, may arise external to the ribs, and I have seen several cases of exosto- sis from the ribs and one of enchondroma. No surgical interference was called for. Exostosis from the first rib may press upon the branches of the brachial plexus and give rise to some pain, or upon the subclavian artery or vein and produce obstruction. Deformities of the chest are mostly due to spinal curvatures, though the contracted or compressed thorax with the projecting sternum of childhood (pigeon breast) is frequently found where some long-con- tinued obstruction to natural respiration exists. This is not, however, permanent in a large number of cases, since children who are the subjects of it “ grow out” of the deformity as their general condition improves and powers strengthen. It is commonly found in rickety subjects, and is thought by some to be the result of enlarged tonsils. It is probable, however, that the enlarged tonsils and deformity are accidental asso- ciates. Deformity of the chest may be due to an old pleurisy. Tapping the Chest. When air accumulates in the chest (joneumo-thorax) either as a con- sequence of disease or accident, causes pressure on the lung and inter- feres with the respiratory process so as to create alarm, the tapping of thechest (paracentesisthoracis) with a small trocar and canula fitted with a valve, may be called for. When blood accumulates ('licemo-thorax) producing similar alarming symptoms, and the blood is mixed with air, and it is clear that life will be extinguished if relief be not afforded, it must be let out; and for this purpose it is probably the best operation to make an incision into the thorax where no wouud previously existed, or to enlarge a small one when present; but to do this with a trocar and canula is always a difficult and often an impossible task on account of the coagulum. When serum presses upon the thoracic contents hydro-thorax) and requires surgical interference, the trocar and canula with the aspirator are beyond doubt the best instrument to employ, great care being observed to exclude air. The object, under all these circumstances, is to remove the pressure from the lung in the most effectual way by the withdrawal of the compressing material. When pus exists (empyema) surgeons are not quite decided as to the best means to be employed, although all are agreed as to the propriety of drawing off the pus. To do this by means of the aspirator or the trocar and canula gives temporary relief, but does not cure the disease, for which more efficient measures are required. For my own part 1 believe that when pus so presses upon the lungs and interferes with the respiratory43 TAPPING THE CHEST. process as to call for surgical interference, the pus must be let out, by means of a free opening, the opening being large enough to permit of the free escape of all fluid, and the ingress and egress of all air, for the ad- mission and retention of air in a suppurating cavity will almost cer- tainly end in decomposition. The introduction of drainage-tubes by M. On drainage- Chassaignac has consequently been of great service in the treatment of tu )es' empyema. Dr. Goodfellow and Mr. De Morgan have been their chief Their advocates in this country, the latter surgeon passing the perforated advocates, india-rubber tube through the canula upon a long iron probe, and bringing it out of a second opening in the lower and posterior part of the chest, this second opening being made with a scalpel upon the extremity of the probe pressed against the lower intercostal space. The perforated tube consequently passes as a seton through the chest and allows the free escape of any fluid in its cavity. This opera- tion, however, has its dangers. My friend Dr. Sutton informed me of a case in which it was performed for empyema and pneumothorax, and, a few days after, emphysema appeared about the wound, which spread over the whole body and destroyed life. 1 have never adopted this practice in the way here detailed. Not advised, being satisfied with a free opening into the thorax, either with a scalpel or large trocar and canula, and the subsequent introduction of a drainage-tube or elastic catheter into the thorax, either through the canula or otherwise, and the subsequent daily washing out of the cavity with a solution of iodine, or, subaqueous drainage may be employed. In May, 1875, I followed the former practice in the case of a gentle- man, act. 87, whom I saw with Dr. Rowlands, of Carmarthen, and drew off three quarts of pus from his left chest through a free opening, and subsequently passed a drainage-tube into the cavity. In three months, convalescence ensued, and in another month, he was quite well, the lung on the affected side having expanded. Indeed, I quite coincide with Dr. Goodhart (‘ Guy’s Hosp. Rep.’), 1877, that “if drainage is decided upon nothing short of perfect drainage is safe for the patientj” and to this end the opening into the thorax must be free, and the cavity of the chest kept well emptied either by irrigation or by what has been described as subaqueous drainage, which should be carried out as follows:—“ Having determined on the spot at which Sub-aqueous puncture of the chest is to be made, a trocar and canula are taken, the dlaill«i:e. bore of which is about five millimetres. A length of several feet of black or red india-rubber tubing, which will slip easily through the canula, is placed ready at hand; the chest is then tapped and the trocar withdrawn, and as the fluid comes in full stream by the canula, the india-rubber tubing is pushed along the latter into the chest as far as necessary—usually four or five inches. The canula is then withdrawn over the tube, leaving the one end of the latter in the chest, while the other or free end is kept under water by the side of the bed. The tube then acts as a syphon.” This plan of drainage is not, however, very complete, for out of 30 cases in which it was employed, as reported by Dr. Goodhart, in 18 im- perfect drainage had to be recorded; and as this is a method which pro- fesses to drain away pus, it cannot be said to have proved successful. In young people where the ribs are elastic, good results may "be looked for; but in the old, where the ribs are rigid, no contraction cau be expected.SURGERY OF THE CHEST. 44 Mode of performing thoracentesis. Dieulafoy’s aspirator. Trousseau’s advice. Sudden death after tapping. On asphyxia, Causes. The Operation. In tapping the chest the following points should be observed—The ninth intercostal space should be chosen just in front of the angle, or the seventh midway between the sternum and spine. This latter spot can always readily be found by drawing a line with a string round the body on the level of the nipple, and midway between the sternum and spine, this line will cut the proper intercostal space. At this spot close to the lower rib, a small incision should be made through the skin and fascia with a lancet or scalpel, and through this the trocar and canula, warmed and oiled, should be introduced; the trocar as soon as it has perforated the chest should be withdrawn, the canula being pushed more home. When the operation has been performed for air or serum, a small instrument should be employed, and great care used to prevent the admission of air. For this purpose there is no better instrument than the pneumatic aspirator of Dr. Dieulafoy, or one of its modifica- tions, and Dr. Bowditch, of Boston, United States, a staunch supporter of this practice, reports (‘ Practitioner,’ April, 1873) that during twenty-four years, and in 270 operations, he had never seen any injury done by the aspirator. As a substitute, one of the canulas may be used fitted with a stop-cock or valve to prevent the admission of air. When the chest requires opening for the discharge of blood or pus, it has been already asserted that a free incision or large canula should be resorted to. I prefer an incision, and make it large enough to admit my little finger, and subsequently, a large india-rubber drainage- tube. Trousseau strongly advises the operation of tapping when serous effusion fills the cavity, as indicated by auscultation and percussion; when oppression of breathing also exists, it may be urgently needed, but this oppression, adds he, is one of the most deceitful of signs, and its absence ought not to inspire too great a feeling of security; as by refraining from interference we run the risk of losing patients, when the operation would assuredly have saved. In empyema he fixes in the canula and draws off the fluid every twenty-four hours, injecting the chest with a solution of iodine, one part of the tincture in six, every two, three, or four days. It should, however, be recorded that sudden death has taken place after thoracentesis for pleuritic effusion or empyema, although evidence is wanting to prove that any distinct relation exists between the opera- tion and death, since cases are on record in which sudden death ensued in the normal course of cases of pleuritic effusion. Trousseau has recorded examples of the latter kind, and Drs. Cayley and Broadbent of the former. (‘ Clin. Society,’ 1877.) Apncea, or so-called Asphyxia. Death from asphyxia, in the common acceptation of the term, means death from either the cessation of the respiratory process or the want of the ordinary respiratory medium (oxygen) the heart ceasing to act after the cessation of the respiratory’ process. Etymologically it means an absence of pulse. The more correct term is apncea. It is caused by whatever interferes with the admission of the air into the lung, by such acts as drowning or hanging; by diseases that mechani- cally block up the air-passages, or excite spasm of the larynx; by any external or internal condition of the thorax that prevents the admission of air into its cavity or interferes with its expansion ; by the want of the respiratory medium or by the inhalation of toxic vapours.DROWNING. 45 Under some circumstances, the asphyxia is rapid or acute, in others. May be rapid chronic. In accidental cases, it is chiefly the former; in disease, the or slow- latter. In both, however, the result is the same, the blood not being decarbonised as it should be, and what Dr. Cleveland has rightly called carbon semi a ensues. Special symptoms may depend entirely upon the nature of the asphyxiating cause, but the ultimate effects are the same in each. In all, whether slow or rapid, there is congestion and lividity of the face. In all, the heart continues to beat, though laboriously, after respiration has ceased, the action becoming gradually less distinct till it stops altogether. It is possible for the heart to continue its action from two to four minutes after the last respiratory effort. After death, it has generally been thought, the cerebral vessels Condition would be found gorged with blood. Ackeman has shown, however, after that this condition is present only when the head of the subject has been kept lower than the rest of the body, and that death by suffocation is always connected with an exsanguine state of the cerebral vessels. The right side of the heart and great vessels will be full of black Heart and blood, whilst the left side will be found empty, and the whole arterial vessels- blood will be, as the venous, of a dark colour. All the abdominal viscera will be engorged with blood. The lungs, in cases of hanging and mechanical obstruction, present Lungs, no characteristic appearance, but in those of drowning they will be more or less filled with water or the drowning medium, and incapable of collapsing, and will feel heavy and doughy to the touch. The air-tubes, moreover, wall be choked with a sanious foam composed of blood, water, mucus, and often foreign matter churned up with the air of the lungs. Frothy water mixed with blood will also pour out of any section of the lung. These points were clearly stated by the Committee of the Koyal Med. and Chir. Society on suspending animation, and recorded in the ‘ Transactions ’ for 1862. Drowning. Sow long a human being may be under water, and yet recover, is On drowning, an important question, but the answer depends upon many considera- tions. Dr. Sanderson believes he has demonstrated by experiments that in animals the duration of life turns upon the amount of air con- fined in the chest at the time of immersion; that when the animal on immersion fills its chest with water by an inspiratory effort, death is most rapid; but if the chest be full of air at the time, and no such inspiratory effort takes place, life may be prolonged for several minutes. The occurrence of syncope at the moment of immersion, whether from Occurrence fright, shock, or previous injury, is consequently a happy accident, of syncope, the respiratory act being materially diminished by the syncope. “ If a person be completely submerged,” writes Dr. W. G. Harley in * Holmes’s System,’ “ and the entrance of water to, and exit of air from the lungs not prevented, we believe that recovery would be impossible after two minutes. On the other hand, if the air-passages were closed against the entrance of water, and the chest kept full of air, we see no reason for thinking that a human being would perish either more slowly or more quickly than a dog placed under similar circumstances, namely, in from four to five minutes.” Death by strangulation is due to asphyxia alone, and, as a rule, is homicidal, being consequently often complicated with other injuries’. Death by hanging is of a mixed form; since in addition to the strangu-SURGEIiT OF THE CHEST. 46 On hanging. Causes of death. Taylor’s views. Effects of short drop. Dr. Barker’s experience. Long drop. Treatment of asphyxia. Rules. lation by the cord, there is the added traction on it hy the weight of the falling body. Hanging causes death, according to Dr. A. Taylor, “ commonly from apncea, hut sometimes from apoplexy, caused by pressure on the jugular vein, being preceded hy convulsions, often lasting for many minutes, hut in all probability not accompanied hy more than momentary pain. Occasionally there is found displacement or fracture of the first or second of the vertebrae, with compression of the spinal marrow. This cause of death is only likely to be observed in corpulent or heavy persons, when a long fall is allowed by the cord, and is seldom met with in judicial executions.” This latter fact is supported by the ob- servations of Dr. Barker, of Melbourne, who informed Professor Haughton, of Dublin, that in fifty-four post-mortem examinations of criminals hanged according to the old or “ short-drop ” system, in not a single case was there dislocation or fracture of the neck. In the following plan, however, introduced by Dr. Barker this dislocation was the rule. Dr. Haughton quotes his words (‘ Med. Times and Gaz./ June 21st, 1871) :—“ I have the knot put about two inches from the spine, so that when it is tightened by the weight of the body the knot comes on the vertebrae; by the fall the body has an impetus forwards, the resistance being at the beam to which the rope is fastened. The knot acts as a fulcrum to push the head forwards. By this arrange- ment I have found in all cases there was a dislocation and fracture of the cervical spine and pressure on the cord, laceration of the muscles of the larynx, and generally fracture of the hyoid bone, death being always sudden and complete; no long drop is required.” To the Irish and American long-drop system there are grave objections. When the cord is crushed, death is instantaneous; when not so injured, life may be prolonged for minutes, usually about three; but there is no evidence to believe that the period may be extended to ten. Conscious life, under both circumstances, probably is soon lost, rarely extending beyond the three minutes. When the cord is not injured, Taylor computes that life may be restored after five minutes of suspension, and Tardieu, an eminent French writer, gives a similar period. Treatment of Apncea or Asphyxia. All obstruction to the passage of fresh air to and from the lungs is to be at once, so far as practicable, removed, all froth and mucus to be cleansed from the mouth and nostrils, and all tight articles of clothing to be at once taken away from the neck and chest. In slight cases of temporary apncea the treatment is as in syncope: dropping the head, which should be low in all cases, a dash of cold, or alternately of cold and hot water to the face, or a smarting slap upon the epigastrium, generally sufficing to revive the patient. When this proves useless, artificial respiration should be instantly commenced. The methods of artificial respiration which have been successively in use are those of the late Drs. Marshall Hall and Silvester; but I believe the best method to be the one more recently advocated by Dr. Benjamin Howard, of New York. This “direct method,” as the author calls it, was first published in the form of a prize essay by the American Medical Association in 1871, and has since been adopted by the United States Government Life Saving Service, the Life Saving Society of New York, &c. It is eminently simple and effective, and is47 DEOWNING. to be applied in the treatment of the drowned as follows, the rules having been drawn np for me by Dr. Howard: Rule 1.—Foe Ejection and Drainage of Fluids, &c., from the Method. Stomach and Lungs. Position of Patient.—Face downwards with forehead resting upon the forearm or wrist to keep the mouth from the ground, and a hard roll of clothing beneath the epigastrium, which should be the highest point, while the mouth is the lowest. (Fig. 318.) Position and Fig. 318. Action of Ope- rator. — With the left hand well spread out upon the base of the thorax to the left of the spine, and the right hand upon the spine, a little be- low the left, and over the lower part of the sto- mach, the opera- tor should with a forward motion throw upon them all the weight and force the age and sex of the patient will justify, ending this pressure of two or three seconds with a sharp push, which helps to jerk him back to the upright position. And this movement should be repeated two or three times, according to the period of sub- mersion and other indications. Rule 2.—Position of Operator.—In a kneeling posture, astride patient’s hips. His hands upon the chest, so that the ball of each thumb and little finger rests upon the inner margin of the free bor- der of the costal carti- lages, the tip of each thumb near or upon the zyphoid, and the fingers fitting into the corre- sponding in- tercostal spaces. The elbows firmly fixed, making 1*'ig. 318a. Artificial respiration by direct method, them one with the sides and hips; then—To Perform48 TREATMENT OF APNCEA. Method applied to stillbirth. Advantages of the direct method. When respiration is re- established. Artificial Respiration. Position of Patient.—Rip or strip clothing from the waist and neck. Face upwards; shoulders slightly declining over. Hard roll of clothing placed beneath thorax; the head and neck bent back to the utmost, with the hands on the top of the head (one twist of handkerchief around the crossed wrists keeping them there) (Fig. 318a). The Operator pressing upwards and inwards towards the diaphragm, using his knees as a pivot, and throwing his weight slowly forwards two or three seconds, until his face almost touches that of the patient should end with a sharp push, which helps to jerk him back to the erect kneeling position. He should then rest three seconds, and repeat this bellows-blowing movement as before, continuing it at the rate of seven to ten times a minute, taking the utmost care on the occurrence of a natural gasp gently to aid and deepen it into a long breath until re- spiration becomes natural. When practicable, the tongue should be held firmly out of one corner of the mouth with the thumb and fore- finger armed with dry cotton rag. Avoid all impatient vertical pushes; the force upward and inward must be increased gradually from zero to the maximum the age, sex, &c., may indicate. Abandon no case as hopeless within an hour’s useless effort. In the application of this method to cases of stillbirth, the child lies along the left hand of the operator, the ball of whose thumb takes the place of the hard roll of clothing seen in Fig. 318a. Over this the shoulders decline, the head falling back with the arms, if convenient, on either side the face. The buttock and thighs are supported by the operator’s fingers. Thus the operator has the prominent little thorax completely within the grasp of his right hand with firm counter-pressure behind, enabling him to apply, locate, distribute, direct or alternate his pressure as he pleases. The advantages Dr. Howard claims for this method over other methods are—1st. It provides for ejection and drainage of fluids, &c., from the stomach and lungs, and in such a way that each motion for ejection induces an alternate inspiration. 2nd. It excludes the tongue from the pharynx without manipulation. 3rd. It secures eleva- tion of the epiglottis and a post-oral air-way from the glottis to the nares. 4tli. It includes a remedy against syncope and cerebral anaemia. 5th. It obtains a more general expansion of the thorax. 6tli. It effects a thoracic compression which is more complete, better distributed, directed and regulated. 7th. It is done by one person, and can be applied instantly on the spot wherever the patient is found. 8th. It is more easily understood by the illiterate, is less fatiguing to the operator, and is free from unnecessary motion or violence. When respiration is re-established maintain the temperature of the body by friction, warm blankets, and when possible by warm water (106° F.), or air bath, keeping the head where a circulation of pure air may be maintained. As soon as the patient can swallow give. warm milk, beef tea, tea or coflee, with a tablespoonful of some spirit, or these may be injected by the stomach-pump. When respiration is restored put the patient into a warm bed, with hot bottles to his feet, and encourage sleep, but let him be watched in case of secondary or relapsing apncea; at the slightest symptoms of which let friction and even artificial respiration be re-employed. Give volatile stimulants., such as the spiritus ammonia aromaticus.SURGERY OF k, THE URINO-GENITAL SYSTEM. CHAPTER XX. DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY—STONE—NEPHROTOMY. Malformations of the kidney have more scientific than surgical in- Malforma- terest, yet, they may have an important surgical bearing, for when any the accident from external violence or internal irritation happens to a single “ ' ’ or imperfect organ, the life of a patient is more likely to be jeopardized than when it is normal. In a case recorded in page, 605, vol. i, this fact was illustrated. When a kidney is single, it is usually large, and some- times the form of a horseshoe; when it assumes a central position, with the convexity of the curve downwards, it may be regarded as a double organ, the vessels entering from above in their normal way. A kidney may also hold a position nearer the pelvis, or even lie in the pelvis, and when loosely connected, it may appear in the abdomen as a movable tumour. At times the adult kiduey maintains the lobulated character it possessed in foetal life. The diseases of the kidney are generally regarded as belonging to the General physician, but I need hardly add that a thorough knowledge of renal pathology is as requisite to the surgeon as it is to the medical practi- i^Oney. j tioner, for, without such a knowledge, he will be unable to recognise the different conditions of the urine with its deposits, and to appre- ciate their significance. He will also be unfit to decide upon the pro- priety of an operation of expediency, or to understand the risks of one of necessity; for the existence of kidney disease, as a rule, is enough to debar the surgeon from performing any operation other than that required to save life, and in such operations it renders the prognosis most unfavorable, since it is well known that the chief cause of death after operations is kidney disease, and the worst forms of the disease are undoubtedly due to calculous affections, to vesical and urethral mischief. In all cases of operative surgery the condition of the kidney, as re- cognised by the urine, should be made out, and in disease of the urinary organs a most careful examination is equally required. Nephritis. Inflammation of the kidney associated with suppuration of the organ On nephritis, has long been recognised as a common consequence of the obstructive disease of the urinary passages. But it may occur as a consequence of Causes, local injury, or as an acute attack upon a chronically diseased organ ; as a consequence of pyaemia or other cause. It is also very common as a sequel to Bright’s disease of the kidney—that is, to disease of the secreting glandular structure of the organ—in consequence of some local source of irritation in any part of the urinary passages. Bright’s Vol. ii.50 CHRONIC NEPHRITIS. Symptoms and | diagnosis. On chronic nephritis. Causes. disease by itself is not a suppurative disease. Suppurative nephritis may occur as an acute affection, or as a chronic though more frequently as an acute upon a chronic. After death, a kidney thus affected may appear enlarged, with its substance more or less filled with suppurating cavities. When the inflammatory action is confined to the mucous lining of the pelvis of the organ, it is called “pyelitis.” At times, the kidney is a mere cyst or shell containing pus and broken-down tissue, and, in extreme cases, the kidney and parts around form one large sup- purating cavity. This result is not rare as a consequence of the break- ing up of tuberculous matter. Symptoms and diagnosis.—When after an injury in the loins, or in the course of some obstructive vesical or urethral disease, or calculous affection, a patient is seized with rigors, severe pain and tenderness in the lumbar region, febrile disturbance, nausea, vomiting, scanty, high- coloured, and possibly bloody urine, and irritable bladder, acute nephritis may be suspected. When rigors recur frequently and there is suppression of urine with renal casts or pus in the urine, sup- puration of the organ is to be diagnosed; and, when to these symptoms are added severe depression, anasarca, and brain symptoms passing on to coma, urmmic poisoning may safely be expected. The more free SZood-cells there are in the urine the greater are the pro- babilities of renal haemor- rhage ; the more pus, the greater the likelihood of renal disease. But chronic nephritis is a more common affection than the acute; indeed, unless from accident, the acute is generally a sequel to the chronic. Kidney disease is a common consequence of long- standing or neglected bladder or urethral mischief. When a stone has existed for any period in the bladder, and has set up inflammation of that organ; when from prostatic disease the same result ensues, or when from stricture the bladder, ureters, and kidneys have been subjected to the irritation and its consequences of distension from retained urine, the ureters become af- fected from the extension of mischief from the bladder, then, too, the pelvis of the kidney, and subsequently the secreting structure of the kid- neys themselves. Under these circumstances, every gradation Eig. 319. Ilosn. Mus.CHRONIC NEPHRITIS. 51 of dilatation, inflammation, or suppuration of the whole urinary passages may be found, the bladder may be enormously thickened and inflamed ; the ureters dilated, tortuous,thickened, and suppurating; the pelvis of the kidney expanded and filled with pus—“pyelitis”—and the kidney itself more or less undergoing disorganizing changes. (Fig. 319.) The symptoms of changes such as these are not very definite. In all Symptoms. long-standing examples of obstructive urinary affections some of these may he suspected, as well as in all cases of neglected stone, particularly when bladder symptoms are marked; when the urine is albuminous, pale coloured, and smoky, or tinged with blood; when it contains pus in suspen- sion, varying in quantity at different times, or shreds of lymph; when a dull aching pain is present in the loins, shooting round the hips into the groin and down to the testicles, and, when the digestive organs do their work badly, and sleep is difficult to secure or superseded by a general drowsiness. Under these circumstances, chronic kidney disease may fairly be Diagnosis, diagnosed with or without suppuration in the organ or around it. When anasarca sets in, or brain symptoms from urmmic poisoning appear, the diagnosis is clear. When rigors are frequent, even when not w ell marked, when lumbar pain is constant and increased on pressure, when on manipulation, evidence exists of some deep-seated lumbar swelling and fluctuation is distinctly or indistinctly to be made out abscess of the kidney is Abscess of fairly indicated. When with these a sudden discharge in the kidney, urine of large quantities of pus takes place, with relief to the local symptoms, it is probable that the abscess has discharged itself through the ureter; when the lumbar pain becomes more intense, the swelling more marked and prominent, and fluctuation more distiuct, it is probable that the ureter has become obstructed and the renal abscess is making its way through the loin externally; and cases are on record in which, after the discharge of the abscess by natural or surgical means, a recovery has ensued. Indeed, stones have been discharged from the kidney in this way with a good result. Renal abscesses are, however, prone to make their way through the diaphragm into the lung or into the colon, rare cases being recorded where they burrowed downwards and appeared below Poupart’s liga- ment, or in the pelvis. In these cases, the symptoms simulate spinal disease, the thigh being flexed upon the pelvis; this symptom too, attended with lumbar pain or tenderness, is very constant in nephritic abscess. Dr. Bowditch, of Boston, was the first to draw attention to the fact in 1869 and 1870. Treatment.—When acute nephritis originates from a blow or from Trcatmen; the irritation of a renal calculus, complete rest in the horizontal posture of acut9 in a warm bed is absolutely essential, with milk diet and the moderate ne,lllritls‘ use of simple diluents as milk and water, or barley water. Poppy fomentations to the loins always give comfort, and, when the pain is severe, leeching is beneficial; cupping has been recommended, and is practised by some. The bowels should always be well cleared out by some simple medicine such as castor oil or an enema. All medicines that act upon the kidney as salines or turpentine, all external applica- tions such as blisters, should be carefully avoided; and for this same reason stimulants ought not to be given. The action of the skin should be encouraged by outside warmth, and52 PERINEPHRITIS. Treatment of chronic nephritis. On perinephritis. tlie hot-air bath or steam bath applied to the patient in bed is a valu- able means to this end ; a hot bath is a good substitute; while calomel and antimony cannot be recommended. When the case passes into the chronic stage, counter-irritation becomes of value, and as this cannot be obtained by means of blisters, since cantharides acts powerfully on the kidneys, mustard may be em- ployed, or a piece of lint saturated with a mixture of chloroform and alcohol applied to the loin and covered with oil silk. Dry cupping, also, is of great value. When acute nephritis supervenes upon the chronic form the result of long-standing disease of the urinary organs, or, after operation, the whole aim of practice must be to soothe, relieve pain, and keep life going. Nothing like mechanical interference with the urinary passages must be thought of. Retention of urine should, of course, be relieved, but the utmost gentleness ought to be employed in the manipulation. These cases are, as a rule, very hopeless. In chronic nephritis the result of local disease, there can be little doubt that the best practice is the removal of the cause. When a stone in the bladder has set up the mischief it should be removed, and by that mode which induces the least local irritation. When a stric- ture of the urethra has been the cause, it should be dilated, for as long as the local cause of the disease exists no recovery can be looked for. When calculus in the kidney is the local irritant, the surgeon’s aim must be to allay local irritation by keeping the patient quiet, and administering soothing remedies; the alkaline potash salts being pre- scribed where the urine indicates uric-acid calculus, and the mineral acids when the urine is phosphatic. The removal of the stone by operation may also be entertained. When suppuration of the kidney takes place, with or without a calculus, and any external evidence of the abscess exists, an opening should be made; though it is a moot question with surgeons at the present day whether it is not better practice to anticipate this pointing by an early incision. When the urine is full of pus, the preparations of buchu are of un- doubted value, and the mineral acids or the preparations of iron of use. Warm baths and diaphoretics to induce free action of the skin, and by these means to relieve the kidney, with a supply of simple nutritious food and stimulants only when absolutely required, make up the treat- ment. Perinephritis is an affection that must be recognised, and, although it may be more frequently found in connection with suppuration of the kidney, it is at times independent of it. It is indicated by a sudden pain in the loin, fever, and subsequently lumbar swelling, with fre- quently cedema of the integuments of the loin. The pain is at times constant and persistent, while at others it may appear and then disappear for an uncertain interval, to recur spontaneously in all its severity. The urine in an uncomplicated case is generally natural, and if at all altered, scanty; renal symptoms, so-called, being absent. When the case is left to nature, the inflammation may attack the chest and induce a fatal pleurisy, or the abscess may burst into the bowel or externally, burrowing beneath the fascia covering the psoas muscle and showing itself in the thigh or pointing in the loin. The surgeon should not, however, leave these cases to nature, but cut down upon the53 HJEMATURIA. abscess or lumbar swelling, as in colotomy, at the outer border of the quadratus lumborum muscle, and evacuate the pus as soon as sufficient evidence exists of its presence; when a good result may be looked for. (Vide paper by Dr. Bowditcb, ‘Am. Journ. of Med. Science,’ 1871.) Htematuria is a symptom met with in many diverse conditions, the haemorrhage being limited or profuse. It may come from one or both the kidneys or any other part of the urinary passage, either as a result of some constitutional cause, such as the haemorrhagic diathesis, or, some morbid condition of the blood, as in purpura, scurvy, smallpox, the plague, or fever. Profuse renal haematuria takes place occasionally as an inter- mittent affection It may likewise follow an injury or disease of the kidney; ureter, bladder, prostate, vas deferens, or urethra. In surgical practice the haemorrhage is more frequently due to some local cau-e, yet the practitioner should be alive to the fact that it may originate from a constitutional, or the use of such a drug as turpentine or cantharides. If the haemorrhage follow an accident, the diagnosis is seldom diffi- cult, for when after an injury to the loin, blood is passed mixed with the urine, it may be inferred that the kidney has been injured, and when slender, cylindrical, pale pieces of fibrin are seen in the urine the surgeon may be sure that they come from the kidney—these clots having been moulded in the ureter and washed down from the kidney- by the urine. Blood also, when intimately mixed with the urine, has probably a renal origin. The passage of a stone down the ureter is also attended by haemor- rhage, which is rarely profuse, and is, moreover, generally accompanied by severe colicky pain shooting down the groin and scrotum of the affected side, with a retracted testicle. When blood comes from a diseased kidney, it is mixed with the urine, as in cases of accident, and may be slight or profuse in quantity, but the nature of the affection or its being due to calculus will have to be determined by the history of the case, the existence of lumbar pain or tenderness, and a close examination of the urine. In cancer of the kidney pain rarely extends to the testicle. Vesical or prostatic haemorrhage, either from injury or disease, chiefly shows itself as blood clots mixed with the urine, the former passing either before or after the latter. The blood at first may fill the bladder; but after some days the urine will only be stained with blood. When the clot has broken up more or less discoloured irregular coagula with fimbriated edges will pass with the urine, these coagula being very characteristic of blood-clot. They may pass per urethram as rolled-up masses, but, when floated out in water will present their natural shape; blood that has been retained within the bladder for any- time will impart to the urine a porter-like aspect. When blood flows at the end of micturition in small quantities, squeezed out, as it were, by the bladder, a calculus or prostatic disease may be suspected; but the same condition is also occasionally met with in the irritable bladder of gonorrhoea, or, after the passage of “gravel.” W hen a cancer of the bladder or prostate, or a villous growth exists pieces of broken up tissue may be detected by the microscope in the bloody urine. In these cases, too, the luevnaturia will be intermittent. Urethral haemorrhage.—When, after an injury to the perineum or pelvis, or a sudden muscular strain, pure blood flows from the urethra, unmixed with urine, urethral mischief may be suspected.

When retention present. Uretliral htemorrhage irrespective of injury may proceed from a chancre, an acute gonorrhoea, or an impacted stone. It may follow over-exertion, or the straining associated with retention of urine or sexual intercourse, It may likewise take place after the forcible bend- ing of an erect penis in a chordee, or during some sudden muscular ex- ertion from a rupture of the vas deferens, as pointed out by Hilton, and, in rare cases, it may occur without any known cause, the blood flowing from the penis unaccompanied by any symptom of disease. I have re- corded two such cases (‘ Clin. Surg.,’ Chapter 47). Urethral haemorrhage as a result of catlieterism is also common, and may be caused by the introduction of some foreign body into the urethra. It should be remembered also that bile when concentrated, indigo, or other rare constituents of the urine, from diet or otherwise, may simu- late the presence of blood, as may the black urine which results from the external or internal use of carbolic acid when absorbed in poisonous doses. This symptom, however, soon disappears on the omission of the remedy. In a case under my care in 1871, of a man who had a weak sore the size of a crown piece, which had been dressed with an oily lotion of carbolic acid one part to forty, the black urine appeared after the second dressing, associated with brain symptoms and collapse of the general powers, which I thought must prove fatal. The symptoms, however, speedily disappeared on withdrawing the drug, and a recovery ensued. In a more recent case, a boy set. 9, wTas unin- tentionally kept in a semicomatose state for two months by the appli- cation of a lotion of carbolic acid (one part to a hundred) to a small sore, the brain recovering its healthy condition on the omission of the lotion. The poisonous action of the carbolic acid was detected through the urine, which was occasionally black. Treatment.—The disease or condition that gives rise to the blood in the urine requires treatment more than the symptom itself, but at times, the bleeding is so profuse as to threaten life. Renal haemorrhage when profuse, may be checked by gallic acid in full doses, gr. v to gr. x three times a day, acetate of lead, tincture of ergot, or matico, opium beiug generally a valuable addition, and, in extreme cases the spirit of turpentine, absolute rest in the horizontal position, and cold milk diet being also adopted. Haemorrhage from the bladder, when persistent, may be checked by tbe application of a bag of ice over the pubes and to the perinaeum; by cold or astringent injections into the rectum, with rest and opium, aud there is no necessity to pass a catheter or to interfere with the clot, so long as the urine flows and retention does not occur—the urine at the natural temperature of the body being a good blood solvent. A clot of blood, when bathed with urine, as a rule so disintegrates in the course of a few days as to allow of its being passed without help. Any dis- turbance of the clot when first formed will probably rather tend to encourage than stop bleeding, consequently, no unnecessary cathe- terism should be employed. When retention exists, the symptoms become urgent, and opium administered either by the mouth or, what is preferable, by the rectum, fails to give relief, the passage of a large-sized catheter and the use of an exhausting syringe, such as Clover invented for use after lithotrity (Fig. 319a), or the aspirator may be called for; yet these measures55 SUPPRESSION OP URINE. should only he employed when an absolute necessity exists, and opium in full doses fails to give relief. Urethral htemorrhage rarely continues for any time, or requires for its treatment more than rest in the horizontal posture, unless caused by some laceration of the urethra or more severe injury. Pig. 319a. Suppression of Urine is the result of renal disease. The kidneys cease to fulfil their functions, On and the constituents of the urine being left in the blood give rise to suppression coma and possibly to convulsions and death. Uraemia or uraemic ofuriue- poisoning is then said to be the cause of death. It may occur at any stage of kidney disease, and not uncommonly follows an operation per- formed on a patient the subject of such an affection; it is a result to be taken into calculation where albuminous urine exists before under- taking any operation. In exceptional cases, however, suppression of urine occurs when no such chronic mischief can be detected, coming on suddenly, as it often does, without cause, and leaving as suddenly without any reason. I once saw a musician who secreted no urine for sixty hours, and then passed what seemed to be a natural quantity; his only other symptoms being those of slight feverishness and headache. In such cases, the hot air, vapour, or warm bath are the best remedies. Stone in the kidney is not an uncommon affection, though generally On stone in painful and often fatal. When the stone becomes impacted in the organ t*ie kidney, and ceases to be movable, it does not give rise to any marked symptoms, and, comparatively speaking, ceases to interfere with life; more fre- quently, however, it often excites much local irritation, if not suppura- tion, and usually kills by destroying the kidney which becomes a sup- purating cyst. Small stones are constantly formed in the kidney and passed through the ureter into the bladder. Large stones may so in- crease as to form a cast of the pelvis of the kidney (Fig. 336), and at times attain enormous dimensions. The symptoms of stone in the kidney are, a tendency to rigor, lumbar Symptoms of pain increased by riding or any jolting of the body, the pain passing stone in the down the groin into the testicle of the affected side and causing its re- and traction, irritable bladder, and blood in the urine. Dr. Owen Rees ^ ^ has pointed out the value of the tincture of galls, added guttatim to the urine of patients who may be suspected to be suffering from renal calculus, this tincture producing an immediate flocculeut precipitate of a light brown colour when any of the extractive matters of the blood are present (‘ Brit. Med. J.,’ Oct. 21,1876, p. 51S). He also asserted that a heavy and continued pain over the sacrum may be the only56 STONE IN THE KIDNEY. May give rise to lumbar renal abscess. Treatment of stone in the kidney. When passing down ureter. When impacted iD kidney. Operative interference. prominent clinical symptom of this affection. When the stone enters the ureter, the inguinal and testicular pain becomes increased, and a colicky pain appears, attended often with sickness and even collapse, the bladder becoming more irritable and the urine more bloody. When the stone passes, all these symptoms suddenly cease, the bladder irrita- tion probably alone remaining. When the stone is in the kidney, lumbar pain shooting down towards the groin is the most common symptom; while exercise, or any quick movement that may stir the stone, excites irritability of the bladder and hsematuria. And, as time goes on, and the local irritation becomes worse, some suppuration in the kidney will occur. As long as the ureter remains open, and pus makes its escape into the bladder, the symptoms are not urgent; but should the ureter become closed by the stone or some inflammatory change, the pus will collect and give rise to lumbar renal abscess. At times, this lumbar swelling may be felt; indeed, in thin subjects, with one hand in the lumbar and the other in the hypochondriac region, a calculus may by palpation even be made out in the kidney, and this examination can be made occasionally with advantage with the patient under chloroform. The lumbar swelling may so increase as to form a large cystic abdominal tumour. When the ureter is obstructed, this result will take place more rapidly than when it is open, as the pus accumulates; but when it is open the pus flows into the bladder and passes with the urine as turbid urine. When allowed to settle in a porringer or glass, its presence will be readily detected. Pus poured into the bladder from the kidney or elsewhere is mixed with but little mucus; but when formed in the bladder is mixed with a great deal. Teeatment.—When a stone has formed in the kidney, the happiest result is its passage into the bladder, which end can be facilitated by the administration of diluents, particularly water, as well as alkaline prepara- tions of potash, such as the citrate, tartrate, or bicarbonate. When sti’ong evidence exists of local irritation, opium or henbane, given either by the mouth or the rectum, are valuable drugs; while a subcutane- ous injection of morphia over the affected kidney at times acts most beneficially. Fomentations about the loin and groin, or the warm bath, also give much relief. When the stone is passing down the ureter, the same practice is to be followed, a warm bath and a full dose of opium often relaxing the parts and favouring the passage of the stone. The administration of chloroform by inhalation may, when the pain is severe, under these circumstances also be tried. In a case I was called upon to see, where extreme agony existed, instantaneous and permanent relief followed the practice, the stone having passed during the inhalation of the chloroform. When the stone has become impacted in the kidney and gives rise to periodical attacks of pain and constant uneasiness—each attack being worse than the last—important questions occur to the sur- geon. Is it to be allowed to remain, where it may, in all probability, set up irremediable disease if not destruction of the kidney ? or, is an attempt to be made to remove it by surgical operation ? Is a surgeon justified in cutting down upon a suppurating kidney, whether resulting from a stone or other cause, and giving free exit to the pus, or, removing the stone ? Is nephrotomy an operation to be performed ?57 NEPHROTOMY. Nephrotomy. It is impossible to enter into all tlie questions involved in tlie Nephrotomy,, operation of nephrotomy, but, after full consideration, I have no "u^able. hesitation in expressing my belief, that when with scientific certainty it has been made out that a stone is impacted in a kidney, and it has been proved from the lapse of time that the probabilities of its passage into the bladder are too feeble to rely upon; when, from repeated attacks of renal irritation, hsematuria and the discharge of pus with the urine, it is clear that serious organic changes are going on which must lead to the destruction of the kidney, and thus probably of life, an exploratory operation in the loin down to the affected organ is not only a justifiable but a conservative and scientific operation, and these observations are still more applicable when renal abscess can be made out. I have proved this in practice on several occasions, having in a man Cases, cut down upon a suppurating kidney and evacuated several ounces of pus with marked benefit, and in another opened a large suppurating renal cyst through the left loin. In either case, had a stone been present, it could have been readily removed. On August 31st, 1876, I likewise cut down upon the right loin of a lady, mt. 27, whom I saw, in consultation with Dr. Moore and Mr. Pocock, of Brighton, with a swelling which we diagnosed as renal, and evacuated three pints of foetid pus—the lady making a good re- covery. In 1877 I cut into the left loin of a woman with a lumbar swelling, and let out a quart of pus with marked benefit, my finger readily passing into the dilated pelvis of the kidney. The operation Operation is not one of difficulty, nor of danger ; in both these respects it is on simple, a par with lumbar colotomy, and it is probable that, iu a few years, it will be as recognised an operation. The operation iu its several steps, should be the same as that described for lumbar colotomy, the kidney being readily reached and dealt with through such an incision as was there indicated. The operation is based on an imitation of natural processes, as stones have been discharged through openings in the loins. Before it is undertaken, however, the diagnosis of an impacted stone or a suppurating cyst ought to be almost certain. With respect to the extirpation of the kidney, I am not prepared to speak so decidedly ; nevertheless it must.be recorded, that out of twelve cases in which it has been performed, four recovered. Dr. Brant, of Klauseuburg, on June 7th, 1872, removed the left Cases of kidney of a man, set. 27, which had escaped from the loin through an extirpation of opening caused by a stab four days before. He tied its pedicle in two kic*ue-' portions with a silken ligature, and recovery took place without a bad symptom. (‘ Wiener Med. Woch.,’ Nov. 29th, 1873.) _ December 2nd, 1873, Dr. A. Campbell, of Dundee, removed the kidney that was the subject of cystic disease through an abdominal incision, having mistaken it for an ovarian tumonr, and the patient, who was a widow, a;t. 49, made a good recovery. The pedicle was ligatured with carbolized catgut. (‘ Edin. Med. Journ.,’ July, 1874.) Dr. Simon, of Heidelberg ; Langeubuch, of Berlin; and Dr. J. T. Gilmore, of Alabama, have likewise removed atrophied kidneys with success. \\ ith these facts before us, the subject is certainly open to considera-DISEASES OF THE BLADDER. 58 tion, and tlie operation need not be classed amongst the unjustifiable operations.

Science,’ January, 1873, and July, 1874. CHAPTER XXI. DISEASES OF THE BLADDER AND PROSTATE. Irritable Bladder. 1 i i k C it On irritable bladder. Causes. Long and adherent prepuce in child. Calculus bladder. Almost every disease of the urinary organs manifests its presence by some bladder symptom, and that symptom is usually what is called an irritable bladder, that is, the patient passes urine more frequently than natural, with or without pain. Such a symptom may indicate some slight deviation from the healthy relations that ought normally to exist between the bladder and its con- tents; or the presence of a severe if not fatal organic disease. It may be a result of some irritation of the glans penis associated with retained sub-preputial secretion, or an adhesion between the glans and prepuce; or, it may be due to a serious cerebral or spinal affection. It may indicate kidney, bladder, prostatic, or urethral disease, and, in many instances, it is the one symptom that has induced the patient to seek advice. The “ irritable bladder,” therefore, though only a symptom, is clinically an important one, and demands elucidation at the com- mencement of a chapter on bladder affections. Irritability of bladder in children.—When this symptom is well marked in a male child, the condition of the penis should first receive attention; since, if the prepuce be long or adherent to the glans penis,. and the secretion from Tyson’s glands from want of cleanliness, have accumulated and become indurated, there will be strong reason to be- lieve, that the irritability of bladder is the direct product of these • apparently simple causes, for any of these conditions of the penis i are sufficient to produce every degree of bladder irritation, and a cure • can only be obtained by their removal. To secure this end, all retained 1 secretion should be taken away, adhesions between the glans penis • and prepuce carefully separated, and, if the prepuce be long, circum- cision performed. If, however, on a careful examination no such conditions are to be observed, the state of the bladder should be inquired into, and for this purpose a sound passed (an instrument with i a bulbous extremity being preferred) (Fig. 343), and, if a stone be detected, the cause of the symptom will be clearly explained, as well as the practice to be followed. It must be remarked, also, that if a calculus be the cause, a careful inquiry will probably detect the presence of other symptoms such as pain after micturition, haematuria, and an oc- casional interruption to the flow of urine—the intermitting urinal flow being very characteristic of the presence of a stone, although all these symptoms may be present in irritable bladder from an adherent pre-59 IRRITABLE BLADDER. puce. When the stone cannot be felt, it is not at once to be assumed that no such cause exists; for, on a subsequent examination, it may readily be discovered, the calculus having been probably covered by one of the folds of mucous membrane of a partially contracted bladder. If, however, a second examination fail to strike it, the condition of the bladder should receive attention; and if to the sound its mucous lining feels rough, and the presence of the instrument cause Rousrh more or less pain and a desire to micturate, the urine will probably be '''adder, found altered in character, and, after standing, to show a cloudy deposit of of mucus, if not of pus ; the latter deposit being very rare, however, in ur,Hne e 0 young subjects. Under these circumstances the general health of the jreatmeMt child will require attention, as it may happen that some slight aperient 0f irritable or alterative or an alkaline mixture of potash, or perhaps a tonic may bladder, be required; the object being to make the urine as unirritating as possible, and thereby to allow the vesical mucous membrane to return to its normal condition. Rest, also, as far as it is possible to be secured, should be enforced. The diet ought to be of the simplest nature, and meat given in moderation, since it will probably be found that the urine is unnaturally loaded with lithates, if not with lithic acid, and this tendency to the deposition of such ingredients would be increased by the free administration of animal food. When, however, a case of irritable bladder in a child presents itself, in which none of the con- ditions alluded to are found, and in which the penis, urethra, and and bladder, appear perfectly natural, the state of the rectum should be inquired into; the presence of worms, and more particularly of Worms as a ascarides, being quite sufficient to produce an irritable condition of the cause- urinary organs. These may be removed by a jalap purge or an enema of some bitter vegetable infusion, such as quassia; but the condition of the digestive apparatus will require attention, as influencing the presence of worms. Excluding the presence of a stone as a cause of irritable bladder in young children, this affection is not one of serious importance if its true cause can be accurately recognised; since the conditions upon which it depends are easily remediable, and the irritability of bladder rapidly disappears on their removal. Irritability of bladder in the adult.—In adult life, this symptom Irritable cannot be regarded in such a favorable light as in a child, since '>!»dtler in it is too often associated with conditions which are of a very serious tllea(lult- nature and are by no means readily removed, although in the adult, as in the child, a congenital or an acquired phimosis, with a contracted preputial orifice, or adhesions between the prepuce and the glans penis, are sufficient conditions to produce this symptom. As a symptom of stricture, the irritable bladder is not without May be a its value; and, as a rule, it indicates considerable narrowing, as well symptom as probably a ocntraction which has been so gradual in its progress atricture- as to escape notice until this irritability of bladder enforced more accurate observation, and induced the patient to seek advice. It must be regarded as a result, therefore, of a urethral stricture which can only be relieved by the removal of its cause. Doubtless it is pro- duced by some chronic inflammatory action of the vesical mucous membrane, and, as such, requires treatment, viz. the dilatation of the Btricture, absolute rest, and the administration of alteratives. As a symptom of enlarged prostate (or of atony of the bladder in60 DISEASES OF THE BLADDER. A symptom of enlarged prostate. Diagnostic inferences. May be due to renal affection. Caution. On cystitis. Chronic cystitis. the aged, in whom no prostatic enlargement exists) this irritability of bladder is a complication of serious import, for in both classes of cases it is due to a want of power on the part of the bladder to empty its contents; in the one case from a mechanical obstruction caused by the prostatic tumour, in the other from a loss of power in the parts— the residual urine under both partially decomposing becomes ammo- niacal, and in this way acting as an irritant to the mucous membrane of the bladder, thereby giving rise to the irritability. The treatment of these cases is not, therefore, a task of difficulty; the removal of the residual urine, and the prevention of its subsequent retention by the cautious employment of a catheter being the most important, together with the frequent washing out of the bladder with warm water, or, water medicated by some solution of morphia, opium, quinine, or nitric acid. The recognition of the cause of the symptom, however, is the main point to he remembered, the practice to be followed readily suggesting itself when the cause is understood. As a sign of gravel, an irritable bladder is of importance, and a careful examination of the urine will determine its true meaning. As a symptom of calculus in the bladder, it is constant and valuable, although in some cases of stone it is extraordinary how little irritation the presence of a calculus will produce. As a sign also of organic disease of the bladder, irritability must not be passed over. The obscurity of this class of cases is, however, very great, and the correctness of diagnosis must rest upon the com- bination of many symptoms, none being of greater value than another. In women, this symptom is a common accompaniment of uterine affections, while in both sexes it is often associated with rectal disease. Lastly, this irritability may be the product of a renal affection, the urethra and bladder being perfectly sound. When, therefore, bladder symptoms exist, and a careful examination fails to discover any disease in the bladder or urethra, it may fairly be assumed that some renal affection is the cause. But a careful chemical and micro- scopical examination of the urine is alone sufficient to enable the surgeon to arrive at anything like a correct diagnosis. Irritability of bladder may also be produced by some cerebral or spinal disease, but the fact can merely be alluded to in these pages. The passage of a large quantity of urine, as iu diabetes, should not be mistaken for irritability of bladder. Inflammation of the Bladder. Cystitis is a common consequence of stone, prostatic disease, stric- ture, or gonorrhoea, and is usually chronic or subacute—the more acute symptoms mostly supervening upon the chronic. As an acute idio- ■ patliic disease it has been described by authors, but cliuically such cases • are very rare. The most acute are those occuring in gouty subjects : as a catarrhal affection. The chronic form is the direct consequence of local irritation pro- duced by the presence of a tumour, stone, or other foreign body; although it is found wherever the flow of urine is interfered with from either prostatic disease or urethral obstruction; the bladder in these cases being irritated by the retained and decomposed urine asINFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER. 61 well as its own ineffectual attempts to evacuate its contents. A similar result likewise ensues when the bladder is paralysed from over-disten- sion, spinal injury, or disease, and is unable to expel its contents, and under these circumstances the more acute forms of the disease and the i worst pathological conditions are found. Subacute cystitis is commonly the result of gonorrhoea, the inflam- i mation of the urethra spreading to the bladder. The seat of the inflammation is the mucous membrane, which becomes ; rough, covered with flakes of adherent lymph and phosphatic secre- tion, thickened, and at times ulcerated, and, in the acute forms of the affection, detached in fragments or as a whole, and thrown off as a slough. This latter condition is generally met with in the bladder of the paralytic, and is probably as much due to the deficiency of nerve supply as to the intensity of the inflammatory mischief, rough cathe- terism having often too much to do with it. In chronic cases, the walls of the bladder become greatly hyper- ' trophied from over-action, thick muscular bands being visible, and, I where the obstruction to the exit of the urine has been of long stand- ing, this thickening of the walls of the bladder is associated with its dilatation. Under these circumstances, it is common to meet with sac- cular dilatations of the mucous membrane, the mucous lining of the bladder becoming pressed outwards as a hernia between the bands of ) muscular tissue forming • t the walls of the organ. Fig. 320. These pouches are usu- ally small, though in ex- i ceptional cases (as seen in Pig. 320) they may be [double the size of the i bladder itself. Into one i of these pouches a stone j may occasionally fall and rest, thereby becom- ing encysted. At times these sacculi are mul- tiple. Symptoms. — When the disease is subacute, ;he symptoms are irri- tability of bladder and inability to retain urine, the desire to pass water being often associated with its uncontrollable passage. The act of micturition is attended with pain, and followed by straining, blood being frequently squeezed out by the forcible con- traction of the organ. Pain is mostly present above the pubes, in the perinaeum and penis, often over the sacrum and in the groin. With these local symptoms, there may be those of more or less severe febrile disturbance.

When ulceration exists. Treatment of cystitis. Treatment m chronic forms. Washing out bladder. In other cases of chronic disease (catarrhal cystitis), the urine will he mixed with greyish, viscid, ropy mucus, or muco-purulent fluid, which so sticks to the bottom of the chamber vessel and together as to fall like a glutinous mass when turned out. The urine will probably, in chronic cases, be alkaline or ammoniacal; in subacute, acid; in neglected cases, the discharge of mucus becomes enormous, and phos- phate of lime often becomes mixed with the mucus and forms stone. When ulceration of the bladder is present all the symptoms are ag- gravated and the local pain severe. Bleeding is a common accom- paniment, the blood being either mixed with the contents of the bladder and passed as dark-coloured urine, or as clot3 of blood. In the cystitis of gonorrhoea, it is probable that the mucous membrane about the neck of the bladder is alone affected; in the more chronic cases of disease, the whole surface and submucous tissue is involved. Treatment.—Whatever may be the local cause of the cystitis, the local symptoms require attention, although in order to a cure the removal of the cause is most essential. Rest in the horizontal posture, hot fomentations or the hot bath, simple diluents such as barley water, linseed tea, milk and water, with alkalies as the citrate of potash in scruple doses, or the bicarbonate of potash in ten-grain doses, three times a day, and, above all, sedatives, are most essential. Of the sedatives, hyoscyamus is the best in half- drachm or drachm doses of the tincture every two or three hours, and where this is not enough, opium may be substituted; but where the kidneys are diseased, opium should always be given with great caution. The morphia suppository is an excellent remedy, or an enema of starch with opium. The bowels should be relieved by enemata in preference to purgatives, although, when severe constipation is present, a good mercurial purge is often of value j leeches to the perinseum are some- times serviceable. When retention of urine complicates the case, catheterism is called for and an elastic catheter should be used with the utmost gentleuess. In chronic cases the infusions of buchu, uva ursi, pareira, or senega, are excellent remedies, the tincture of cubebs or copaiba at times acts also beneficially ; the triticum repeus, as introduced hy Sir H. Thompson in the form of a decoction, two ounces to the pint, is also a valuable drug. When gout is the assignable cause, colchicum sometimes acts as a charm, and in some cases of gonorrhoeal cystitis, the same good effect is often experienced. The best way is to give it with five-grain doses of the carbonate of lithia. When stone is the cause, it should be removed; when stricture coexists it must be dilated; when enlarged prostate or atony of the bladder in the aged is the cause of the cystitis it is essential to keep the bladder empty and prevent any residual urine from remaining to decompose, and so add to the irritation; for this pur- pose the catheter should be introduced daily, and in severe cases the blad- der should be washed out, either by a stream of tepid water or medicated solution. Ten minims of diluted nitric acid to five ounces of water in the best form, or the same quantity of the tincture of iron. Mr. R. White, of Dublin, speaks highly of borax gr. iv to eight ounces of water, and T. W. Nunn of a solution of two grains of quinine in 2J ounces of water with a drop of diluted sulphuric acid. When the urine is fetid, Condy’s fluid or a few drops of tincture of iodine, carbolic acid, or of one part of thymol dissolved in seven of glycerine may be added to the water.63 INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER. In doing this the greatest gentleness should he observed; to force fluid into the bladder by a syringe is dangerous, unless in skilled hands, while to introduce more than three or four ounces of fluid is unnecessary. The Ibest method is by means of the irrigator can or a piece of india-rubber Syphon tubing, two or there feet long, fitted to the top of the catheter after method the its introduction, and the gradual pouring of the water or solution besl‘ made warm through a glass funnel fitted to the other end. The tubing can be raised to increase the pressure of the fluid, or depressed accord- ing to the necessities of the case, the bladder resenting the slightest distension by its contraction, and the expulsion or elevation of the fluid into the funnel. By these means no harm can possibly accrue to an inflamed bladder, and the most atonic bladder can be emptied as with a syphon. (Pig. 321.) After the fluid has been introduced and left for two or three minutes, it should be withdrawn, and fresh fluid poured in where necessary, the funnel being depressed below the level of the bed for emptying the bladder. Anodyne solutions are said not to be of much Anodyne use in these cases, but I have been in the habit of introducing half a injections, grain, more or less, of morphia, with apparent advantage, after the washing out of the bladder. When the washing out of the bladder in- creases the irritation it should be discontinued. At times a double catheter is of use, the injection flowing down one side, and the contents of the bladder out pIG_ 321. .of the other. In the inflamed bladder associated with atony, the [Tt\ \ Treatment of tincture of the perchloride y cystitis with of iron is a valuable drug, atony, or the dilute nitro-muriatic acid given in twenty-mi- y X. nim or half-drachm doses three times a day; but, in a general way, alkalies are called for, the urine na- turally secreted being acid, and so as it is poured into the inflamed bladder, / becomes an irritant.

Ulceration of the Bladder, This is rarely the result of ordinary cystitis, though it may occur in the paralysed organ, and is met with after death where cathe- terism has been frequently employed, and in cases of stone. It is likewise found in tuberculous subjects from the breaking down of tuberculous material, as well as in cancer. The disease is indicated by the same symptoms as exist in inflamed bladder, with more local distress, more blood in the urine, and greater pain after micturition. There is usually also much constitutional depression and want of power. I have seen two cases in which extravasation of urine above the pubes resulted from this disease, one of which recovered and the other died. The indications for treatment are similar to those for cystitis, opium being freely used as a suppository or an enema. All mechanical inter- ference should be avoided unless absolutely called for, and then it should be of the gentlest kind. It is a question, however, whether, in the severer forms, an incision into the bladder, as for lithotomy, would not be a sound practice, the urine then would flow away as secreted, and a chance given to the bladder to recover itself; at any rate, the operation would give relief. I have done this on several occa- sions with success. Vesico-intestinal Fistula. This is sometimes met with, and it is probable in the majority of cases that the ulcerating process commences in the bowel and in- volves the bladder in a secondary way. It usually first manifests its presence by the passage of wind with the water, some little irritability of bladder having previously existed; faeces, liquid or solid, soon follow, giving rise to fetid urine and severe bladder symptoms, the pain of foreign material in the bladder being very marked when the large intestine or rectum is involved; the liquid motion of the small intestine does not appear to give rise to the same local distress as the solid. There is no difficulty in recognising this mixture of urine and intestinal contents. When flatus passes per urethram the condition may be suspected; when the urine has a faecal odour and colour the condition gives rise to something more than a suspicion; and when solid faeces are visible the diagnosis is certain. In doubtful cases- the microscopical examination of the sediment of the urine will readily reveal its nature. At times the faeces may obstruct the urethra and cause retention. In looking into the history of these cases there will usually be found some bowel symptoms, some diarrhoea or dysenteric affection, some symptoms of stricture or cancer of the bowel; and, although this affec- tion may be found associated with cancerous disease, it seems more frequently to be the result of the simple perforating ulcer of the bowel. Treatment.—When a faecal fistula bas once formed between the bowel and bladder, the hopes of an unaided natural cure are very feeble, and, when solid motions mix with the urine, but little can be done to palliate the suffering that is produced. For a time the bladder may be emptied of its contents, and, by being washed out,, freed of its local irritant; but the truce can be only for a limited period, another action of the bowel being to a certainty followed by a fresh entry of fmculent material into the bladder with all its evil effects.65 DISEASES OF THE BLADDER. When liquid motions or small intestine contents communicate with the bladder the symptoms are not nearly so distressing, and the neces- sity for interference is thereby diminished. . _ The only means the surgeon has at his disposal by which relief can C ilctomy be afforded is colotomy; and, when the rectum is the seat of the a‘ disease, whether cancerous or otherwise, lumbar colotomy ought to be performed. By it the faeces are diverted from their unnatural channel and discharged through the loin, and all the miseries of bladdei complication are effectually relieved. When the ulceration is of a simple kind, there is some prospect of its closing; when of a can- cerous nature, such a result cannot be expected; but, under both circumstances, a large amount of relief is immediately afforded and life prolonged. I have had four cases of vesico-intestinal fistula, in which this Examples, operation, lumbar colotomy, has been performed with marked success; one lived six years after the operation, and died, ait. 70, from ruptured heart; the second is still alive and well, seven years after the operation; the third died four months after the operation from kidney disease. Mr. Holmes, Mr. C. Heath, and Mr. Pennell, of Rio, have had similar cases. For further information vide Holmes’s paper, * Med.-Cbir. Trans.,’ 1866-7; and case, with remarks, by author, ‘Brit, and Foreign Quarterly,’ Jan., 1869; and ‘Clin. Soc. Trans.,’ 1872. Tumours of the Bladder. These, as met with in practice, may be ivarty, fibrous, villous, epi- Tumours ot thelial, or cancerous. The first three benign growths are usually more tl,e bladder, or less polypoid and connected with the mucous or submucous tissue of the bladder; the epithelial and cancerous being more infiltrating. The warty and fibrous are most frequently found in children, and Warty and give rise to symptoms similar to those of stone and urinary obstruc- li’)rou3' tion. They are rarely attended with hemorrhage, differing in this respect widely from all other vesical growths. In the early stage they cause bladder irritation, and in the later, as they approach the urethra, difficult micturition or retention; at times in females, the polypus may protrude through the orifice of the urethra. They cause death usually by obstructing the urinary outlet and inducing organic disease in the bladder and kidneys, suppurative nephritis being a common cause of death. Pathologically they may appear as outgrowths from the mucous and submucous tissue, gradually becoming polypoid, the expulsive action of the bladder, doubtless, having considerable influence in en- couraging this result. They are composed of fibro-cellular or fibrous tissue not unlike the polypus of the nose; and occasionally assume more of a warty character. They are sometimes, although rarely, single; generally many pedunculated growths spring from a single base, while sometimes they appear to cover a large surface of the bladder. In Fig. 322 this condition is well seen. It was described by Sir A. Cooper as “ Tumour of the mucous membrane of the bladder everted. Polypoid 5 excrescences producing symptoms of stone.” Polypoid outgrowths occasionally spring from the prostate gland and give rise to similar I symptoms. Treatment.—Little more than palliative treatment has hitherto Treatment. Jbeen employed in these cases; as the disease has been little under- stood and rarely treated. Yet an old surgeon of Guy’s, Warner, in 1747, incised the urethra of a woman, set. 23, who was'suffering from * VOL. II. 566 VILLOUS OB VASCULAK GBOAVTHS. Cystotomy. Villous or vascular growths in bladder. Characters. a polypus, and put a ligature round tlie peduncle of a growth the size of a turkey’s egg with complete success; and Dessault, after removing a stone from a male, successfully twisted off a polypus that he found in the bladder. Mr. Birkett, in a striking example of the disease occurring in a female child set. 5, applied a ligature to the growth, but the patient died with suppurating kidney, the effects of the disease (Med.- Chir Trans., 1858); and, on reading the descriptions of other cases, the prac- ticability of successful operative inter- ference does not appear impossible, Bichard Volkmann on Nov. 30, 1874, having removed a pedunculated myoma growing from the fundus of the bladder from a man set. 54, by means of the su- prapubic incision—a perineal cut into the bladder having been previously made for diagnostic purposes. The man died from peritonitis the next day (‘Arch. 26, Clin.-Chir.,’ Bd. 19, p. 682). The case, when left to nature, can have but one euding. When the diagnosis can be made with tolerable correctness, an incision into the bladder, as in litho- tomy, with the view of applying a ligature to the base of the growth is not even in the male a dangerous operation, and in pedunculated tumours may prove successful; and, when the growth cannot he removed the operation will doubtless be of value in giving a free open- ing for urine to escape, and the growth to expand, in this way relieving symptoms. In female subjects the prospects are even more favourable: as when the bladder has been laid open it may be possible to remove the growth by torsion, ligature, or excision, when a cure may ensue, and if it prove impossible, relief to a certainty will be afforded to all the symptoms as well as life prolonged. Villous or vascular growths (for these terms are synonymous) are found in the bladder as in any other part of the urinary passages.. They grow from the mucous or submucous tissue, and appear as tufts of villous processes like the villi of the chorion. They are usually small in size, and at times multiple, that is, two or three of these tufts are found in the same subject; occasionally, too, . the interior of the bladder seems covered with these villous growths. In an example recently uuder my care this was the case. They are essentially innocent in their nature, and have no relation to cancer as was formerly believed. They possess, moreover, this peculiarity, that they bleed profusely, and even from a single tuft the size of a nut, fatal haemorrhage may occur. They differ widely in this respect from the polypoid tumours last considered, as in these, hsematuria is usually the first symptom that attracts notice, and the most persistent; indeed, it is ofteu the only one. If the growth in any way affects the orifice of the urethra, obstruction may exist, but not otherwise. For diagnostic purposes the urine should always be most carefully examined, as it is Fig 322. Polypoid outgrowths from mucous membrane of bladder. Preparation 210423, Guy’s Museum.CANCER OF THE BLADDER. 67 by no means uncommon for some of the villous tissue to be passed with the water, and then under the microscope its true nature may be revealed. In a case I saw some time ago, with Mr. Dukes, of Canonbury, of a female child who had several attacks of haematuria, I caught in the eye of my catheter with which I was examining the bladder, a small | villous growth, aud accidentally pulled it away. Microscopically its structure was characteristic, and the child had no return of the disease. Pig. 323, taken from i a drawing, illustrates one of these i growths. Each villus is com- i! posed of elongated nucleated cells h and loops of blood-vessels, and is covered with columnar epi- thelium. Treatment. — There is no i cure for this affection, and the || surgeon can only relieve sym- j ptoms; pain and irritability of I] bladder by sedatives, retention I by catheterism employed with extreme gentleness, and haemor- rhage by astringents, as gallic acid and iron. Astringent injections have been recommended, The disease usually destroys life in about two years; but a patient of mine died lately who had symptoms of it to a marked degree, with occasional profuse haematuria, for eight years. The whole mucous surface of the bladder was covered with this villous growth, the bladder hypertrophied, and the kidneys diseased as in an ordinary obstructive affection. Cancer of the bladder is a disease of the old or middle aged, and may occur as a primary disease of the organ, but more commonly from extension of disease from the rectum, uterus, or prostate. It may assume the form of the hard, soft, or epithelial cancer. Haemorrhage is the earliest as it is the most prominent symptom, dysuria and all the other sigus and indica- h tions of obstructive disease of the urinary passages soon making their a appearance. Local pain of a lancinating character is tolerably con- h stant, and is referred much to the loins, thighs, and perinaeum. The m bleeding is often profuse and sudden, blanching the patient; cachexia ti soon shows itself, and death from exhaustion, with glandular enlarge- i; ments in the pelvis and loins. The urine often contains debris of broken-up cancer with the blood, I which when found, renders the diagnosis certain; yet the surgeon should '£ remember, that the epithelium of the bladder assumes such variable fa forms as to compel great caution in coming to any conclusion with «' regard to the nature of a growth from isolated cells.

Treatment.—Here, as in the villous growths, palliative treatment is alone applicable ; opium or other sedatives to relieve local pain and give rest being essential. These remedies are most valuable probably as injections into the rectum, or as suppositories. The general powers of the patient should be supported, and everything applied that can give comfort; but no surgical or medical treatment is of any real avail. Tubercular disease of the bladder. This is a rare although a real affection, and is confined to young middle age. It is generally associated probably with the same disease of the kidneys or prostate, and shows itself as a deposit of tuberculous matter in the mucous and sub-mucous tissue, which when it breaks down, is an ulcer. It is usually accompanied with symptoms of irritable bladder and painful micturition, the latter symptom being more common when ulceration has taken place. Rest in the horizontal posture is essential in this as in all bladder affections, anodynes, tonics, and nutritious food being of great value. My friend, Mr. Poland, told me, that in a case of tubercular disease of the bladder attended with ulceration (which was under Mr. Aston Key’s care when he was a dresser), where the suffering was severe, Mr. Key suggested the propriety of laying the bladder open, as in lithotomy, and thus allowing the urine to flow off as soon as it reached the bladder. The patient, however, was too far exhausted from advanced lung disease to allow of its performance. Mr. Key stated that, in another case where the disease had not made so much progress, he should not hesitate in performing the operation. The bladder in this • one was found almost stripped of its mucous membrane, and what remained was studded with tubercular deposits. Mr. Key called it phthisis of the bladder. Atony of the bladder is a want of muscular power in the bladder to expel its contents as a result of its over-distension from either compulsory retention, or organic obstruction, some cerebral disturbance or fever, &c. It has been often i falsely described as paralysis of the bladder, but, whereas in paralysis ■ the loss of power is due to a want of nerve supply, in atony it is the result of want of muscular power due to exhaustion or over-stretch- ing. It may be associated with retention or with incontinence, the latter condition showing itself when the bladder is over-charged, the dribbling of urine being a mere overflow. Treatment.—As the cause of atony of the bladder is muscular ex- haustion, so the treatment consists in giving the organ muscular repose, which can be done by catheterism. Where the atony is not very com- plete, the drawing off of the urine twice a day may suffice to allow the organ to recover its tone, and to act naturally. But when the atony is extreme, it may be necessary to introduce a catheter into the bladder and to fasten it there, the urine being allowed to run away as secreted through a tube fixed on the end of the catheter. By this means the most complete rest can be given to the organ. Where the bladder is sluggish in resuming its functions, tonics such as iron may be given, with the local injection into the bladder of some stimulant, as cold water, diluted nitric acid or tincture of iron in the proportion of four to ten drops to the ounce; but catheterism alone, as a rule, is enough, these cases generally recovering unless the cause has been acting for too long69 INCONTINENCE OF UKINE. a period. When recovery is slow, an electric shock through the pelvis is often beneficial. Paralysis of the bladder _ _ Paralysis of is a far more serious affection than atony, since the want of power is Hie bladder, due to deficiency in nerve supply, which deficiency may be partial or complete. It is met with whenever the spinal cord is injured or diseased, as in brain shocks or disease, in reflected irritation from disease about the rectum, uterus, &c., and after any operation upon these parts. It may he caused also by a severe mental shock, or the general depression from a fever. Tkeatment.—The cause of the paralysis in these cases must always Treatment, have an important influence on the practice of the surgeon, but the necessity of keeping the bladder empty is essential under all circum- stances ; for this purpose a soft, full size elastic catheter had better be passed two or three times a day, the greatest gentleness being observed in the manipulation. When anything like cystitis is present it should be locally treated by washing out the bladder, &c., as already indicated. To leave a catheter in the bladder is not desirable. When professional aid is not always at hand, a nurse may at times be entrusted with a full-sized vulcanised india-rubber catheter without a stilette, and allowed to pass it; it has simply to be pushed down the penis and can do no harm. In fever cases the plan is a good one. Hysterical retention Hysterical is not rarely met with in women, and is difficult to treat. Catheterism reteutiou. is only to be resorted to when necessity compels, hysterical patients usually micturating when the pain of retention calls loudly for relief. The cold douche over the lower part of the abdomen is a good local remedy for the affection, and not too pleasant for the patient to wish for its repetition. Moral treatment is always called for in these cases, and is more needful than surgical interference. Incontinence of Urine Incontinence is met with under two very different conditions. In the one, during 01 sleep, when the will of the patient is in abeyance—the neck of the Causes, bladder ceasing to act from want of power, and giving rise to noctur- nal incontinence. In the other, the incontinence is only a result of over- distension, and is a mere overflow. The first form is common in children, the second, in adults. Incontinence, however, both in the child and adult, may bo due to bladder irritation from the presence of a stone or other foreign body, and it will then exist during the day rather than at night. It may also follow the operation of lithotomy from injury to the sphincter of the neck of the bladder. Incontinence in the child is a very troublesome, and often very Incontinence obstinate afl’ection. It is, notwithstanding, generally curable, and even in tlie clll|d- in very bad cases, as puberty approaches, the symptom disappears, though in exceptional instances, the infirmity continues in after-life. The child is generally brought to the surgeon because he “ wets his bed,” when too often the history reveals the painful fact that punish- ment has been severely tried before professional advice was sought; and it is needless to add that by such a process, no cure can be effected. In many instances, the habit is in a measure induced by a want of attention in the parents to take the child up during the long hours of the night.Treatment. Incontinence in adults. Treatment. 70 INCONTINENCE OF URINE. When the prepuce is very long or adherent, circumcision should be performed. When the urine is chemically wrong in any of its constituents, remedies must be given to correct the faults, and a limpid watery urine in a child, as in an adult, is always an irritant. With respect to medicines, the tincture of iron is doubtless the best, and next to it, belladonna, either in the form of the tincture or extract, but in some instances the combination of the two is excellent. I have tried and been disappointed with full doses of chloral given at bed-time. It acts at times wonderfully well, but at others appears use- less. When employed, it should be given on an empty stomach. Tonics are the right medicines, one form often succeeding where another fails; iron, quinine, nux vomica, and zinc being, as a rule, better than belladonna. The tonics by day and a night-dose of belladonna have sometimes proved of value. The bowels should always be attended to, and the presence of worms considered; and it is well to have the bowels relieved at night before going to bed. When the child is not too young, cold baths with or without salt should be used, and every means employed to maintain the general health, although it must be added, that children who labour under this infirmity are rarely feeble and cachectic. The child should be encouraged to sleep on his side in preference to his back, and for this end, a handkerchief with a knot in it may be fastened round the pelvis, the knot being adjusted over the sacrum. In cases of extreme obstinacy, some surgeons apply a solution of nitrate of silver, ten grains to the ounce, to the neck of the bladder, and it said with advantage. Others apply mechanical means to prevent the flow of urine, such as an india-rubber ring around the penis, or cover up the urethral or preputial orifice by a layer of col- lodion. Good reports have been given of these practices. I cannot say that I think well of any such means and have never adopted them, as they seem wrong in principle. Nocturnal incontinence in a child generally means atony of the sphincter; while incontinence during the day suggests bladder irrita- tion, generally a stone or urethral obstruction. Incontinence in the adult, as already stated, means, as a rule, over- fulness of the bladder, the real condition being one of retention from some obstructive urethral or prostatic disease, bladder atony, or paralysis. It may, however, be due to stone, or the result of a preceding lithotomy. In women it may be associated with some uterine displacement or dis- turbance, some urethral disease or injury. In men and women, severe spine disease may cause it. To treat it, the cause must be ascertained, aud, as the first means of investigation, the introduction of a catheter is probably a sound practice to follow, since it settles at once the question of retention, and often detects the ti-ue cause, thereby giving a clue to the treatment to be adopted, viz. the removal of the cause. True incontinence, however, is met with in severe cases of general or local paralysis, in functional derangement of the cord from venereal excesses, and still more frequently from self-abuse; such patients often complaining of “ inability to stop the flow of urine when com- menced.” It is, however, seen in old people with prostatic enlarge- ment, the third lobe being enlarged and projecting forward betweenDISEASES OE THE PKOSTATE. 71 the lateral lobes, so as to open out the neck of the bladder and render it constantly patent, the incontinence being due to overflow, the result of retention. In these cases, the use of a urinal is the only remedial means at the surgeon’s command, except in those caused by venereal excesses, when tonics, cold bathing, and absolute abstinence from all injurious habits may effect a cure. DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. The diseases of the prostate gland are of importance, placed as it is On diseased at the neck of the bladder and the commencement of the urethra, for Prostttle- on the one hand it may suffer as a consequence of urethral disease, and on the other, when diseased, it may give rise to bladder symptoms of considerable severity. Thus, it may inflame or suppurate as a con- sequence of urethral disease, gonorrhoea or stricture, and mechanically interfering with the flow of urine, cause retention. It may indeed undergo nearly complete destruction from suppuration, the direct con- sequence of stricture and possibly of extravasation. When enlarged from hypertrophy, stone, cancer, or any other cause, it may mecha- nically interfere with the flow of urine, and so give rise to bladder symptoms or bladder disease of no slight severity', and it may cause incontinence by the special direction of the growth of one of its lobes. Inflammation of the Prostate. This is usually due to the extension backwards of a gonorrhoeal in- Inflamed flammatiou, or, to the presence of a stricture. It may arise, too, as prostate, a complication of cystitis from the irritation of a calculus, the passage of a sound, or the application of caustics. It is also not unknown as au idiopathic affection in gouty subjects, and in those who indulge in sexual excesses. It is generally ushered in with pain in the perineum and bladder Symptoms, irritation, the act of micturition being attended and followed by pain, and often tenesmus. Def as cation ceases to be a painless act and is attended with uneasiness, sometimes with difficulty, and at last with distress. On manipulating the perineum, a deep-seated fulness will be felt, and on passing the finger into the rectum, the prostate will be found enlarged, spongy, and painful; rigors probably' will form one of the general symptoms with febrile disturbance, which will vary in severity according to the acuteness of the affection. If the inflammation advances to abscess, a throbbing pain at the neck Abscess of the bladder will be felt, with a constant desire to go to stool, and lorms- retention of urine is almost sure to occur. If left alone, the abscess will probably burst into the urethra and dis- charge itself externally with immediate and marked relief; while in other cases, it may open into the rectum. It sometimes happens that the abscess is ruptured during the passage of a catheter to relieve reten- tion, or during a rectal examination. When the disease is acute, the local as well as the general symptoms will be severe; but when chronic, they will be less marked though not less characteristic. As a result of acute inflammation, chronic disease is often left, as Chronic indicated by pain in passing water, irritability of bladder, a thin prostatitis, urethral discharge, cloudy purulent urine, and perineal, pelvic, and anal pain, which is increased on exercise or excitement. There may be72 HYPERTROPHY OP THE PROSTATE. Treatment of prostatitis. With retention. With suppuration. Treatment in chronic prostatitis. Abscess about prostate. Hypertrophy of prostate. at times some little loss of power in emptying the bladder, pain in sexual intercourse, or frequent nocturnal emissions. Treatment.—When the symptoms are acute few remedies give more relief than the application of fifteen or twenty leeches to the perinteum, followed by a hot hip bath and the subsequent appli- cation of a linseed poultice made with the decoction of poppies or mixed with the extract of opium. A good purge should also be resorted to and alkalies given with sedatives such as morphia or opium, to allay pain. When retention of urine complicates the case, a catheter must be passed, a catheter coude being the best, but not before the warm bath and opium have been employed, as the introduction of a catheter under such circumstances is always painful and may do harm. When required, an elastic instrument, which has been well softened and oiled should be selected. Rest in the horizontal posture should be observed, and liquid diet given. When an abscess has formed, and there is evidence of deep-seated perineal suppuration, an incision in the median line of the perinseum should be made; and, indeed, if suppuration has not taken place, the [operation, by lessening tension, will be followed by relief to the symptoms. When the abscess has opened naturally, no surgical interference is usually required, although in exceptional cases where one abscess is followed by another, and the deep parts about the gland instead of undergoing repair are becoming more involved, a perineal incision should be made. When the suppuration is the result of a stricture, and has probably been caused by extravasation, the propriety of divid- ing the stricture and laying open the perineum down to the prostate cannot be questioned. In chronic inflammation, whether the sequel of the acute or not, when attended with suppuration, the practice already advised should be followed. When no suppuration exists but only enlargement, counter- irritation by means of small perineal blisters is of great use, and the elevation of the pelvis with a pillow at night is also valuable. Tonics, as a rule, are required with the iodide of potassium. The bowels should never be allowed to be confined, the best laxatives being some saline medicine, or one of the natural mineral waters, such as Vichy or Pullna. All mechanical interference with the prostate should be avoided, and the nocturnal emissions treated on general principles, and not as being due to a local cause; tonics, generous living, and fresh air doing more towards hastening recovery than anything else. Over- exercise must be avoided, and sexual excitement forbidden. Abscesses occasionally occur around the prostate and give rise to very many of the same symptoms as a prostatic abscess. They are more apt, however, to make their way towards the posterior part of the perineum into the ischio-rectal fossa. As soon as they are recognised they should be opened by one or two deep incisions in front of the anus on either side of the median line. On one occasion, I let out, by twro incisions about a pint of pus that had accumulated in this part, and produced complete retention of urine for several days. Immediate relief and a good recovery followed the operation. Hypertrophy of the Prostate. This is a general term applied to a chronic enlargement of the gland73 DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. which is not inflammatory, but is generally believed to be a common consequence of old age, indeed, it has been regarded as a general senile change. Pathological investigations, however, have taught us that this is not the case, Thompson, with others, having clearly proved that although it is an affection of advanced life, it is in no way a necessary attendant on old age, the vast majority of old men having nothing of the kind. When present, it is usually met with in subjects over sixty. Thomp- son has not met with an example under the age of fifty.-four; and, after many dissections of the prostates of elderly men, he found an appre- ciable enlargement of the organ in one third of the cases, but in only one third of these was it enough to cause symptoms during life. The disease is generally believed to be an hypertrophy or over- Pathology, growth of natural tissues, and, in a certain proportion of instances this is doubtless the case; but in others, the enlargement is clearly caused by the development of distinct glandular tumours embedded within the Glandular structure of the gland which may be squeezed out of the organ upon tumours, division of the tissues covering them in. They are sometimes merely covered by the capsule of the prostate, while at others, they are well placed within its structure; at times they are single, at others mul- tiple, and rarely give rise to any other than mechanical symptoms. When these growths are situated in what is called the third lobe of the prostate, they give rise to symptoms of obstruction and bladder irritation, precisely similar to those caused by the genuine enlarge- ment or hypertrophy of the gland itself. These fibrous or glandular 1 tumours are analogous to those found in the uterus. This hypertrophy is now known to be, as shown by Ellis and others, a mere increase in j|the natural fibrous and muscular tissue of the organ with the glandular [structure.

This enlargement of the prostate may so derange the course of the muscular fibres about the trigone of the bladder as to produce a bar or ridge that mechanically interferes with micturition. Guthrie and Mercier have described such a bar as occurring independently of these changes, the bar consisting of the elastic structure and mucous mem- brane of tbe neck of the bladder. Thompson also asserts that, in “ very exceptional instances, the bar is undoubtedly to be met with.” I have never known such a bar as that last described, and give it only on the authority of the names quoted. It is said to occur earlier in life than prostatic enlargements, and to give rise to similar symptoms. Hyper- trophied prostates are sometimes met with, measuring four inches in diameter, and are common at half that size. They have been found to weigh ten or twelve ounces, the normal weight of the prostate being four and a half drachms. Symptoms.—So long as the vesical orifice of the urethra is not mechanically encroached upon, prostatic enlargement may proceed to an extreme degree without giving rise to any definite symptoms, and retention of urine is very often the first feature that attracts notice. But, under these circumstances, it generally will be found that the patient has had for some time a difficulty in micturition; that the bladder has hesitated to contract when the desire to pass urine mani- fested itself; and that either there has been less force in the expulsion of the fluid than formerly, or, that the water has flowed in a more languid stream. Irritability of tbe bladder will generally be present, the act of pass- ing urine being rapidly followed by the desire to do so again, and the difficulty of the act gradually increasing. As the disease progresses, a feeling of weight and fulness in the perinmum and of irritation about the rectum will soon appear; the rectal irritation and the irritability of bladder increasing equally, till at last the two acts of defsecatiou and micturition take place together, the violent straining and tenesmus giving rise to pro- lapse of the rectum or piles, and leading the patient to believe that the bowel complication is the cause of his disease, if not the disease itself. At a still later period and as the result of the bladder being unable to empty itself, a residuum of urine remains behind, and tbe bladder consequently gradually expands from its accumulation, and becomes exhausted by its ineffectual expulsive efforts. Tbe urine, moreover, at the same time, decomposes and acts as a direct irritant to the mucous membrane of the bladder. In this way, inflammation of tbe bladder, and subsequently incontinence from the overflow of a distended organ, is produced, this inconvenience existing day and night.' The ultimate result of this affection left to nature is the same as that of all obstructive urethral diseases; from the pressure of retention the bladder suffers first, and subsequently the ureters and kidneys; organic renal disease is thus set up, and the powers of life are gradually sapped by exhaustion, death being often hastened by severe bladder symptoms, hsematuria, or urajmic poisoning.75 DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. A physical examination of a patient labouring under this disease will probably reveal a bladder more or less distended; and the passage of a catheter even after the patient has to the best ot his belief, emptied his bladder, will prove the presence of several ounces of urine which may be ammoniacal; this change in the urine being produced by its partial decomposition from its retention, and admixture with the mucus of the bladder. In neglected cases, the urine will be foetid and may contain blood. The passage of the catheter will also reveal the nature of the obstruction at the neck of the bladder. On passing a finger into the rectum the enlarged prostate will be flectal felt, and in some cases may nearly fill the pelvis. When pus or fluid ex,,mumuon. exists, fluctuation will be detected, and when inflammation, pain. To make this examination nicely, the finger should be well anointed, and, at the moment of its introduction, the patient should be told to bear down. It should be remembered, however, that to appreciate any abnormal condition of the gland, it is necessary to be familiar with its normal state. Mav ]e|1() t As a consequence of this affection and of the change produced in calculus, the urine, a phosphatic calculus may form, but its presence is often masked by the symptoms of the disease. When, however, there is increased pain after micturition, pus and blood in the urine, and ex- treme pain in the penis, a calculus may be suspected, and, when frag- ments of phosphatic deposit pass, the suspicion is confirmed. In all long-standing cases of prostatic disease with bladder symptoms, the presence of a stone should be suspected, although when present, it is often difficult of detection from being protected by the enlarged prostate, behind which it usually lies. A patient with enlarged prostate is liable to Retention from any sudden chill, over-distension of the bladder, mental emotion, or fatigue; indeed, such acicdeuts usually reveal the presence of the affection. Treatment,—Medicine has no influence in checking the progress Treatment of of this disease, nor in causing absorption of the enlarged organ ; but enlarged surgery can do much in the way of palliating the symptoms that are Prustilte- the direct result of the enlargement, and neutralising its evil effects. The most essential point is, to ensure the complete evacuation of the instrumental bladder’s contents, and also to see that no residuum of urine remains in aid. the bladder to irritate the organ and decompose, thereby setting up cystitis. This should be done by the passage of a catheter. In early cases where but little bladder irritation exists, the passage of the in- strument once a day may suffice; but, when the residual urine is in any quantity and the bladder has lost some of its power of contrac- tion, the introduction of an instrument two or three times in the twenty-four hours may be necessary, and, in worse cases, where the bladder has lost all power of contraction on account of its over-dis- tension from chronic retention, it may be necessary or expedient to tie a catheter in the bladder, and leave it there for a time. The surgeon must remember, too, that iustrumental aid, though valuable, is a necessary evil, and should not be resorted to more frequently than the necessities of the case demand. Where instruments are required, a flexible full-sized catheter is the Catheters to best. When silver instruments are employed, one with a large curve a®dflexil,le should be selected, the back of the catheter riding more readily over lull-sized.HYPERTROPHY OF THE PROSTATE. 76 the enlarged vesical or third lobe of the prostate than a shorter one. To assist in the introduction of any instrument into the bladder, the passage of the index finger of the surgeon’s left hand fully into the rectum is an excellent aid, and, under all circumstances, the pelvis of the patient should be well raised on a pillow. When an elastic instrument is used and some difficulty experienced in riding over the obstruction, success may often be achieved, as soon as the end of the instrument has reached the vesical end of the urethra, by the withdrawal of the stylet with one hand and the pres- Nn force to sure °f the catheter into the bladder with the other. Force should be used. never be employed, gentle manipulation and care almost always sufficing to secure success. When the disease is chronic and the necessity of catheterism is pro- bably permanent, the patient should be taught to pass a gum elastic catheter for himself; a few lessons and a little confidence being all that is required for the purpose. When the bladder from over distension has lost all power, and it is necessary that it should have complete rest to allow it time to recover its tone, a catheter may be fastened in, and, if the instrument sets up much bladder irritation, a good compromise may be found in the practice of leaving it in at night and removing it during the day. When When the introduction of the instrument is attended with great eatheter may difficulty, it may be expedient to leave an instrument in for some days, e e ln‘ but, under these circumstances, the bladder should be washed out through the catheter daily. The vulcanised india-rubber catheter is a good form to employ for this purpose, although at times it causes more urethral irritation than the gum elastic. Mr. Holt’s winged catheter or any other self-re- taining one may be employed when difficulties are experienced with keeping in the simpler form. May require When retention is present and catheterism impossible, the surgeon rectum*6 ^ may lje called upon to puncture the bladder per rectum in order to give relief. When severe cystitis exists and the agony of catheterism be- comes unendurable, a clean incision into the bladder as in lithotomy, to allow the urine to flow away, is a desirable measure. General With the local treatment of this affection, the general must not be treatment. neglected, although in importance it is quite secondary. When cystitis exists, it must be treated upon the principles previously laid down. The general condition of the patient must be maintained by means of good diet and sufficient stimulants. The skin should be kept warm and all sudden chills avoided; the bowels kept open, but not loose; pain should be relieved by sedatives and sleep secured by hypnotics; tonics are often called for, the preparations of iron being as a rule the best. Exercise should be taken when there is no inflammation of the blad- der or other reason to forbid it, walking and driving being the best forms, and, under these circumstances, the local distress from the affection may be rendered very light, and life prolonged for many years with comfort. Patients with this affection should once a day, as a matter of habit, pass urine on their hands and knees; the bladder in this way having more power to evacuate its contents, and the mucus and other more solid contents, which otherwise would lie behind the prostate, are got rid of with greater certainty.77 DISEASES OP THE PROSTATE. Atrophy of the prostate is often found in the aged and in the young; On atrophy and in rare cases it is due to some arrest in its development. jn °f prostate, the majority, it is genuine atrophy or fibroid degeneration, probably caused in some by syphilis. Such a condition, however, does not give rise to any symptoms by which it can be recognised during life, nor is it a cause of any distress. Calculi of the prostate are not rare, and may be found embedded in On calculi of the organ as small stones varying in size from a grain of sand to Prostate- bodies of much larger dimensions. They are often very numerous are sometimes amorphous, but generally laminated. Wollaston says they are composed of 84 per cent, of phosphate of lime, | per cent, of carbonate of lime, and 15 per cent, of animal matter. “ The prostate gland, like other glands, is liable to an inspissation Mode of of its secretion, producing small yellow, sometimes red, pale or colour- ,ormiltlon- less bodies, scattered throughout the follicular structure. These, at first, are said to consist entirely of organic matter, which Virchow believes to be derived from a peculiar insoluble protein substance mixed with the semen; but sooner or later, these formations are believed to irritate the mucous membrane, causing phosphatie depositions, which become encrusted upon the organic matter, and thus the genuine pros- tatic calculi are found.”—Poland. When embedded in the orgau and not interfering in any way with the Symptoms, urethra, they cause no symptoms; when encroaching upon the urinary passage, they may cause obstruction, but certainly must give rise to urethral and, probably, bladder irritation. They are accompanied occa- sionally by ulceration and suppuration of the surrounding parts. A prostatic calculus may project into the urethra and increase, Calculus may the urethral portion subsequently extending backwards into the extend into bladder and forming a prostato-vesieal caculus. In ‘ Guy’s Hospital ladder. Fiq. 325. Prostate Prostato-vesieal calculus. Reports’ for 1857, a case recorded by Poland, with references to others, will be found (Fig. 325). The calculus has a dumb-bell shape In all these cases, the urethra is usually pervious; the passage of a sound, however, as a rule, detecting its presence—a grating sensation being experienced in the passage of the metal instrument over the78 STONE IN THE BLADDER. Treatment calculus of prostate. Cancer of prostate. Symptoms. Treatment. Tubercle of prostate. Condition of healthy urine. stone, but no ring will be heard. A large prostatic calculus may also be felt per rectum. Treatment.—When a prostatic calculus gives rise to sufficient symptoms to indicate its presence, and by its size is likely to prove troublesome, it should be removed by a perineal section—by such an operation as median lithotomy, the incision stopping short of the bladder, when the stone does not involve it. In this way, Dr. Barker (vide Bruit’s ‘ Vade Mecum’) removed a large stone nearly five inches in diameter with success. When the stone, or stones, give rise to few symptoms of importance, they should be left alone; occasionally they pass naturally per urethram. The greatest argument against opera- tion unless absolutely essential is found in the fact that these calculi are mostly multiple, and often exist in both lobes of the prostate. Cancer of the prostate occurs but seldom, and is generally of the soft kind; indeed, as Dr. Walshe stated in 1846, “the evidence of the occurrence of true scirrhus of the prostate is defective.” The symptoms are those of enlargement, and increase rapidly in severity, the disease being attended with more frequent and profuse haemorrhage than the ordinary hypertrophy. The blood follows the straining which attends the act of micturition, and appears as pure blood; after catheterism it is often profuse. The disease may be primary, but is commonly secondary. It cannot exist for any time without giving rise to glandular enlargements in the groin or along the iliac vessels, when, as a rule, the patient’s powers rapidly yield. The treatment is only palliative, the surgeon dealing with symptoms. All instrumental interference should be of the gentlest kind, and as little as possible. Pain must be relieved by opium, and the general powers maintained by good nourishment and stimulants. Tubercle of the prostate probably, as a rule, only occurs as a part of a general tuberculosis; and until the deposit is breaking up, or by its presence is producing some suppurative action, it gives rise to no sym- ptoms by which it can be recognised. It is too often associated with renal or bladder disease, and the local prostatic mischief is lost in the more general affection. It is quite possible that some of the cases of so- called idiopathic abscess of the prostate are the result of the breaking down of this deposit, but there are no clinical data to enable the surgeon to diagnose the presence of this disease, and there are, consequently, none other than general rules of treatment to be mentioned.

Before passing to the subject of stone in the bladder it appears desirable to consider, though briefly, that of urinary deposits, organic and inorganic; as the value of a sound knowledge of what the urine may contain, either in suspension, solution, or precipitation, is as great to the surgeon as to the physician, and as indispensable for successful practice.STONE IN THE BLADDER, 79 The student should remember that healthy urine is a clear, acid, amber-colour fluid, with a specific gravity of 1020 to 1030; that in 1000 parts, 954-81 consist of water, 45'19 of solid matters. These solid matters are made up as follows: urea, 2T57; uric acid, 0-36; extractives, such as creatine, creatinine, xanthine, hippuric acid, ammonia, sarcine, pigment, unoxidized sulphur, phosphorus, mucus, &c., 6-53; chlorine, 4’57; sulphuric acid, T31; phosphoric acid, 2'09; potash, 1-40; soda, 7T9; lime, 0-11; magnesia, 0T2. He should further remember that, after drinking, or after a meal, the urine is altered by the nature of the diet and probably diluted; and that the best sample of urine to examine is that passed in the morning before breakfast—the “ urina sanguinis” of Prout; when this urine contains any ingredient in excess or in deposit, some important derangement of the system exists. When any of the constituents of Disturbance the urine are in excess, the balance which normally exists between !al them, and that keeps them in solution is disturbed, and, as a conse- quence, some deposit takes place. When this excess consists of the saline matter of the urine such as those of potash or soda, urinary deposits and stone are less liable to form on account of their solubility than when the excess is found in the alkaline earths, for the salts of lime and magnesia are most insoluble, and consequently, when in excess, soon show themselves as gravel or calculi. For the same reason, uric acid being very sparingly soluble, is a very common urinary deposit, and is a constituent of most stones. When blood or pus is found in the urine, the surgeon has to discover its source. Is the origin of the blood urethral, prostatic, vesical, or renal ? Has the pus been secreted by the bladder, or been poured into it from the kidneys or other part of the urinary tract ? Is the salt the result of some ex- cessive supply of its chemical constituents, some deficiency in the work- ing power of the machinery of the body, or some accidental circumstance ? Are the kidneys themselves at fault ? or, is it that they are called upon to excrete morbid products which have accumulated in the blood from organic or functional disturbance of other portions of the body upon which the existence of healthy blood depends ? All these points have to be determined in dealing with any case of urinary deposit; and in the special works devoted to the subject can be found all that is neces- sary to guide the student. What I seek to impress here is, that urinary deposits are not Deposits themselves diseases, nor to be dealt with as such. They are always indicative of to be accepted as indications of disease, functional or organic, in Mellon"*1 some of the working organs or other parts of the machinery of the body. The reader is referred for all special information on these points to the works of Bird, Beale, Owen Rees, Bence Jones, William Roberts, Thudichum, Vogel, and Hassall. Healthy urine ought to be quite clear. It may, however, be slightly hazy from mucus or from the deposition of urates in cold weather without being abnormal. When any deposit has been merely sus- pended in the urine, it will commence subsiding as soon as the urine has passed. These deposits are mostly organic, and derived from the kid- neys themselves or urinary passages. They may consist of epithelium- cells, columnar or tesselated, from those parts, with more or less mucus.

At times the debris of kidney structure or cancer products may be found. Em. 326. Fig. 327 Spermatozoa. Blood in urine. Pns in urine. Urates.

Pus, when poured into the urinary passage, has usually little mucus with it; that secreted by the bladder is greatly mixed with it. Purulent urine is always albuminous. The urates generally appear as “brick dust” or “red gravel” depo- sits. When they do so, as soon as the urine has cooled down, there is generally some diminu- tion in the watery con- stituents of the urine with febrile disturbance.

Heat dissolves only the urates of the urine. Potash dissolves all deposits except the phosphates and oxalate of lime. Hydrochloric acid dissolves all except uric acid. When any of the inorganic deposits just described mass together Formation of either by themselves upon any nucleus of organic matter such as blood sto»e, or a foreign body, a stone is the result. This stone may form in the kidney and remain there; it may pass into the bladder and be emitted with the urine, or rest there and increase; or, the calculus may have its origin in the bladder either from the precipitation of the earthy constituents of the urine, or, from the irritation of a foreign body introduced from without. A stone having a renal origin and resting in the bladder seems to have the power of extracting from the urine its inorganic elements, and thus rapidly increasing; oxalate of lime, urate of ammonia, uric acid, phosphate of lime or triple phosphate, being precipitated by its presence, and aggregating or crystallising upon its surface. It acts, too, after a time, as a foreign body, sets up bladder irritation, and, as a consequence, the phosphatic salts are deposited from the decomposition of the urine. Dr. Owen Rees has shown in his ‘ Croonian Lectures,’ 1856, that where irritation of the bladder exists either from a calculus, foreign body, or other cause, the mucous membrane secretes an alkaline fluid that tends to cause a precipitation of the earthy phosphates, and the formation of a phos- phatic deposit upon a calculus. Renal calculi are generally composed of uric acid, urate of ammonia, On renal or oxalate of lime, and Beale states, that microscopic renal calculi of calculi, phosphate of lime are by no means uncommon. These concretions mav Characters, be either impacted in the uriniferous ducts, lodged in pouches connected with the ducts and increase in the structure of the kidney, or pass into the pelvis of the kidney. They may be single or multiple and the size of a hemp-seed, nut, or walnut, or, they may be so moulded to the divisions of the pelvis of the organ as to assume an arborescent shape such as that figured (Fig. 336). Dr. Gee has lately recorded a case in which a renal calculus weighed 36£ ounces 0 Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1874). There is reason also to believe, that a renal, like a vesical calculus, may form upon a nucleus of blood the result of an injury. When the stone is fixed in the structure of the kidney, its presence may be indicated by but few, if any, local symptoms. When it moves about in the pelvis of the kidney, it gives rise to symptoms known as those of nephritic colic; paroxysmal lumbar pain, with nausea, vomiting, or collapse, irritability of bladder, and at times painful micturition and haunaturia being the chief symptoms. When the stone passes into the ureter all these are aggravated, epain shooting down the groin, thigh, and scrotum of the" affectedURINARY CALCULI. 84 Effects produced. Vesical calculi.

When calculi accumulate in the kidney and increase in size, inflam- mation, suppuration, and even the entire destruction of the kidney, may ensue; although it is remarkable to what an extent one kidney may be destroyed without giving rise to any symptoms. On the other hand, severe symptoms may appear for a time and subside, either to re-appear months or years later, or not at all. In exceptional cases, a renal calculus may be discharged externally through the loin with suppuration; Dr. Cayley showed such a specimen at the Pathological Society, 1874. A stone may be impacted in the ureter, and not rarely at its vesical orifice, when it will give rise to renal symptoms by obstruction, &c. After a stone has reached the bladder, it may be discharged with the urine or become fixed in the urethra and cause obstruction; or, it may rest in the bladder and increase, and then require surgical treatment. It is probable that most vesical calculi have a renal origin, and that some small nucleus of either uric acid or oxalate of lime forms in the kidney and passes downwards into the bladder, where the urine super- saturated with these constituents deposits them upon the renal calculus, and increases its size. Stones thus formed have been called primary calculous formations. When a foreign body has been introduced into the bladder, or a stone has descended into it and sets up much bladder irritation or cystitis, the phosphatic salts of the urine are deposited upon its surface, and stones thus formed are, therefore, phosphatic. When urine is retained in the bladder and decomposes, either as a consequence of cystitis following paralysis, diseased prostate, urethra, or a new growth, its earthy constituents are thrown down and phosphatic calculi or con- cretions are formed, such deposits being known as secondary calculous formations. How far these latter may increase so as to form stones is yet an open question. All these chemical constituents, however, require to be held together by a kind of cement: “ Marcet referred it to the mucous secretion of the bladder; Fourcroy and Vauquelin to albumen, and sometimes to gelatine with an admixture of urea; Berzelius, however, could not determine whether it was composed of fibrin, albumen, gaseous matter, or mucus; Brande considered it to consist of a mixture of gelatine with urea; Scliarling holds that the smaller calculi are always en- veloped by a layer of mucus, albumen, or some other organic matter, the flocculi of which entangle and ultimately determine the crystalli- sation of the more insoluble ingredients of the urine; and Dr. Hoskins, as quoted by Gross, extends this view to the minutest particle of the • concretion.’1—Coulson. Urinary calculi, says Poland, may be arranged like the deposits into two distinct classes. The first will include calculi of uric acid and the urates, with their modifications the oxalates, xanthic and cystic oxide (Dr. G. O. Rees regarding the oxalate of lime as uric acid or urates, altered after secretion) ; the second, the phosphatic calculi. A third class may be added, consisting of the rare calculi of carbonate of lime, the fibrinous, the uro-stealith, and the siliceous formations, other chemical ingredients being present, such as organic matters, carbonate of magnesia, silica, oxide of iron, benzoate of ammonia, oxalate of85 URINARY CALCULI. ammonia, phosphate of iron, urea, &c. The oxalates are the heaviest stones, the phosphates the lightest and largest; few exceed an ounce in weight. Coulson records one, however, over six pounds. Recent calculi contain moisture, and consequently are heavier than old. Stones vary in shape according to their position. Thus, renal calculi are generally irregular, often arborescent; those in the ureter elongated, approaching a cylindrical form. Bladder calculi when single, are more ovoid and flattened, when multiple, facetted. The mulberry stone or oxalate is always tuberculated, mostly globular and hard; the uric acid and urate calculi smooth and regular, the phosphatic irregular of odd shapes and soft. The dumb-bell calculus is usually prostato- vesical or encysted. The colour of a calculus is no good guide to its nature, as all calculi when associated with bladder irritation and ammoniacal urine become covered with a white coating of phosphatic deposit. A stone of uric acid, however, is usually fawn or brown coloured, of urate of ammonia cinder-grey, of oxalate of lime brown or blackish-green, of xanthic or uric oxide cinnamon-brown, of cystic oxide a grey-greenish hue. Phosphatic calculi, as are other forms when covered with a like de- posit, are often horribly fetid and ammoniacal. They are too com- monly soft and friable. The section of a calculus reveals its structure, and, while some are homogeneous, the majority display concentric layers of different degrees of thickness ; exceptional examples displaying fine lines radiating from its centre of a crystalline form which may be seen in the cystine calculus (Pig- 340). The different layers of a calculus may have the same composition, or differ widely. When the latter, the calculus is known as alter- nating ; but any single layer is generally com- posed of several ingre- dients. “ It is probable,” says Odling, “ that if a very exact analysis were made, each of the layers of nearly every calculus , would be found to con- tain uric acid, alkaline urates, phosphate of lime, and ammonio-phosphatc of magnesia, with or without the other consti- tuents of calculi. More- over, most calculi contain traces of all the salts naturally existing in the urine, as well as colour- ing matter, mucus, &c.” Most calculi are divisi- Additional classes. Calculi in general.

The nucleus may be of the same nature or different from the body.URINARY CALCULI. 86 On uric acid calculus. Urate of ammonia calculus. Oxalate of lime calculus. It may be composed of some organic material, such as blood, mucus, &c., or a foreign body introduced from without (Fig. 341). 1. Uric acid calculus is by far the most frequent, forming, accord- ing to Cadge, nine tenths of all primary formations (‘ Address on Surgery/ 1874). It is usually derived from the kidney, and when retained in the bladder, becomes a flattened oval stone of a fawn or yellow colour with a compact and occasionally crystalline laminated structure (Fig. 337). The uric acid is generally mixed with the alka- line urates in variable proportions. This form of stone is often found in gouty subjects, and generally in the middle period of life. It is usually associated with acid urine, and such as is prone to deposit the urates. The nuclei of most calculi are of this nature. In the catalogue of calculi of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, plate iv, fig. 6, there is a drawing in which a uric acid calculus is shown to have formed round a piece of steel. 2. The urate of ammonia calculus is not common. In Guy’s Museum there are only seven specimens of it out of 394 calculi. Most compound calculi contain this substance in abundance. They are seldom large, mostly smooth, and of a grey-fawn colour. On section, they are homogeneous or indistinctly laminated and have an earthy fracture. They are more commonly found in children although they have been removed from adults. Guy’s Museum contains a bottle (No. 2213) in which are 142 calculi of this nature which Sir A. Cooper removed from the bladder of one patient. They are of the colour of pipe-clay, and in the form of cubes with the edges and angles rounded off. The rarity of this form of calculus is probably due to the solubility of the salts. 3. The oxalate of lime or mulberry calculus stands second in point of frequency to the uric acid in European countries; though Dr. H. Y. Carter tells us that the oxalate of lime ingredient predominates in all urinary calculi in Northern India (‘ St. George’s Hospital Reports/ 1871-2). These calculi vary in colour from grey to a rich brown or black, and have an external form of a tubercular, angular, or spinous character, being rarely perfectly smooth (Fig. 338). In some, the sur- face is studded with spines so acute and slender as to resemble thorns, Fig. 338. Mulberry calculus . . its section. while in others, there is a coating of acute octohedrons of transparent oxalate of lime, giving an extremely beautiful appearance. Occa- sionally these crystals are opaque and the octoliedron is flattened when the calculus appears as if studded with pearl-spar (Prep. 2139s,87 URINARY CALCULI. Guy’s Museum). The intervals between the spines are sometimes filled with urates or phosphates, which give the stone an ovoid form. The section of a mulberry calculus is generally that of an imper- Section of. fectly lamellated structure, the consecutive layers forming waving lines which often resemble the knotted heart of an oak (Pig. 338); but occasionally a layer of oxalate of lime is to be seen arranged around the interior one with great regularity, having a remarkably radiated appearance like a series of infinitely minute needles placed side by side, and presenting a perfectly porcellaneous structure. In compound calculi the oxalate of lime deposit gives to the character of a stone a remarkably beautiful appearance resembling that of fortification agate. » The oxalate of lime calculi that have their origin in the kidney (and pass soon after their descent) are usually small, smooth, hemp-seed bodies. The crystalline mulberry stone is of a pale brown colour, and, ac- cording to Dr. Yelloly, composed of nearly pure oxalate of lime. Poland had a case of this kind in which the stone on extraction crumbled to pieces from the absence of any binding material of animal matter. He gives also, on the au- Fig. 339. thority of Mr. C. Williams, of Norwich, an account of a pure white oxalate of lime calculus. “This,” he says, “ is of a milk-white colour, possesses a highly polished surface, is of extreme rarity, and is generally, if not al- ways, found in the kidney ; its external surface presents no crystals, but is perfectly smooth, though it may be spinous. In the museum of the Norwich Hospital are three specimens.” Mixed calculus. The nucleus of a mulberry stone usually contains uric acid (Fig. 339), while the body is often made up of alternate layers of uric acid and oxalate of lime. The urine is generally acid. Singular as it may appear, these rough mulberry stones rarely give rise to so much bladder irritation as the smoother forms; possibly they roll about less. White oxalate of lime calculus. Its nucleus. 4. Cystine or cystic oxide calculus is of rare occurrence, and is a Cystic oxide formation of the kidney. Wollaston discovered it in 1810, and the eal*-,ulus. second calculus which he analysed is in Guy’s Museum and is about an inch in diameter (Fig. 340), and contains sulphur in large proportions. Poland points out its hereditary nature, since out of 22 collected cases' 10 occurred in four families, and in these the subjects of the complaint were brothers. The calculi are generally rounded or smooth but may be slightly tuberculated. They have a wax-like lustre, and appear semi-transparent and glistening. When recent, they are of a pale yellowish-brown colour, but when kept long assume a pea-o-reen appearance. Dr. Bird remarks upon this point, «It has been suggestedURINARY CALCULI. 88 Phosphate lime calculus. Triple phosphate calculus. Fusible calculus. to me by Dr. Proufc and Dr. Willis that this alteration in tint may in some way depend upon changes produced in the sulphur.” They are soft in consistence, and on sec- tion, present a very imperfectly radiated structure with no tendency to a develop- ment of concentric layers. They yield easily to the knife when scraped, and form a perfectly white powder, whether the cal- culus be green or brown. The fracture is crystalline. 5. Phosphate of lime calculus.—There are two varieties of this form ; the one as described by Wollaston of renal origin, consisting of neutral phosphate of lime. These usually have a smooth polished sur- face of a pale brown colour, and are regularly laminated—the laminae being so slightly adherent as to he easily separable into concentric crusts; in some, lines are seen radiating in a direction perpendicular to the laminae. These calculi contain a considerable proportion of animal matter. The other form is of vesical origin and composed of phosphate of lime similar to that of hones, and hence often called “ bone earth ” calculi. They are more common than the former, and constitute irregular masses resembling mortar, or a granular, semi-crystalline powder, enveloped in a tenacious mucus ; these latter being more con- cretious than stones. There are three cases on record in which the phosphatic calculus has been followed by other forms. Foreign bodies, as a rule (and vesical calculi of long standing are such) have the earthy phosphates deposited upon them. 6. Triple phosphate, or ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate calculus is rare. The College of Surgeons possesses but three specimens, and Guy’s only two. No. 2154< in Guy’s Museum shows one which has no nucleus, but a central cavity lined with delicate crystals of triple phosphate, resembling the crystals of quartz in the cavities of flints, while No. 2152 is a section of a large calculus of the kind on a nucleus of a tobacco pipe. Fig. 341 represents such a calculus formed round a piece of broken catheter, and oc- curred in the practice of my friend Dr. Kitchener. 7. The fusible calculus, or the phosphate of lime with phosphate of magnesia, and ammonia calculus, is the most frequent of the phosphatic calculi. It is generally due to the presence of ammoniacal urine from cystitis, and constitutes the crust that forms on other calculi, or on foreign bodies introduced into the bladder. These calculi increase Fig. 341. Triple phosphate calculus with nucleus of a piece of catheter. Fig. 340. nail *>' izre Cystic oxide calculus. Guy’s Mus., No. 52143.URINARY CALCULI. 89 to a large size, are irregular, and mould themselves to the position in which they are placed, often filling the bladder. Their colour is white, grey, or dull yellow, their consistence friable and more earthy than any other variety, sometimes so soft as to resemble moist chalk. Their appearance on section is thus described by Mr. Taylor in the catalogue of the calculi of the Royal College of Surgeons of England “ They are frequently composed of concentric laminae, which in general adhere hut slightly to each other; between the laminae shining crystals of the triple phosphate are often observed; or some of the laminae are entirely wanting, and these form a white friable mass like chalk; in others, they appear semi-crystalline, as if made up of numerous small crystals confusedly aggregated together. In calculi that have a crystal- line and glistening texture the triple phosphate is most abundant, while the calcareous phosphate is in excess in those which have an amorphous earthy appearance.” 8. The carbonate of lime calculus is a very rare form. Tliudichum says that prostatic calculi sometimes consist almost entirely of this sub- stance. In Guy’s Museum, No. 218760, such a vesical stone exists of a snow-white colour, with a nucleus of uric acid. Odling says that calculi which have undergone partial decomposition in the bladder often contain this ingredient. 9. The uric (of Liebig) or xanthic oxide calculus which bears a close relation to uric acid, is as rare as the last. Dr. Marcet detected the substance in a stone of eight grains’ weight, hut no remains of it are at Guy’s. Stromeyer re-discovered it in a stone weighing 335 grains, removed by Langenbeck, which was laminated, and of a bright brown colour. A portion of this calculus is in Guv’s Museum, No. 2145". 10. The fibrinous calculus of Marcet and Prout requires notice, although, according to Bird, it must he regarded as a portion of dried inspissated albuminous matter exuded from an irritated kidney. Such pseudo-calculi present considerable lustre and a vitreous fracture. 11. The uro-stealitli calculus seems to be made up of fatty matter. It has been described in Heller’s ‘ Archives,’ 1844-5, and by Moore in the ‘ Dublin Quart. Journ.’ for 1854. In Hunter’s collection there is likewise a fine specimen of the kind. 12. Blood calculi have likewise been described by Marcet, and Roberts has recorded one taken from a sheep by Mr. Lund of Man- chester. All recorded cases have been connected with renal haematuria. Silica, and also the urates of soda and lime, are occasional ingredients in a stone. With this brief description of the varieties of stones, for much of which I am indebted to Poland’s article in ‘ Holmes’s System,’ it may be well to consider if any diagnosis of their nature can he made before their removal, and for this purpose the character of the urine is of great value. If it be acid the stone is either uric acid, oxalate of lime, or a mix- ture of the two; and, as the uric is more common than the oxalate the probabilities point to the former. When the urine contains either ingredient, the nature of the layer that is being deposited is esta- blished. Gouty people are more prone to uric acid than to oxalate calculi.

If the urine he alkaline from fixed, alkali as indicated bv the per- manent change in the test paper, the earthy phosphates or the carbonate of lime calculi are indicated; if from the carbonate of ammonia the result of decomposition of the urine, the mixed phosphates; that is, a crust of these is being deposited upon an unknown nucleus. When a small stone has been previously passed and examined, great help is given towards the formation of an opinion, and also when gravel has been passed. On frequency In England, one person in 100,000 dies annually from stone, in Scotland of Stone. one in 50,000, and in Ireland one in 200,000. The proportion of deaths varies greatly in different districts. Cadge informing us, in his very able address given before the British Med. Assoc, for 1874, that in Norfolk, the mortality from stone is one in about 42,000,and in Cheshire, one in about 425,000. In the sexes. The bills of mortality indicate, that ten males die to one female from calculous disease, and stone is said to be found in men twenty times more frequently than in women. It is probable, however, that stones form as readily in the one as in the other, but that in women, owing to the shortness of the urethra and its capability of dilatation, they are more readily discharged, large stones not being rarely dis- charged in the female sex by natural efforts. (Vide Stone in Female.) Aire at which The statistics of M. Civiale, Coulson, and Thompson indicate that with" US m6t a^ou^ 60 per cent, of the cases of calculi are found in subjects under twenty years of age, 10 or 12 per cent, in those between twenty and forty, 12 to 15 per cent, in those between forty and sixty, and about 10 to 12 per cent, above sixty. But iu taking these absolute numbers and comparing them with the relative numbers of persons living at the different periods of life named, it would appear, that children and young persons are less liable to calculous disorders than has been commonly supposed, and that for twenty years and upwards, the tendency goes on increasing in a very remarkable manner to the end of life; or, as Sir H. Thompson puts it, that the “proportion of elderly calculous patients to the existing population at their own ages is larger than the proportion of children afflicted is to the number of existing children.” Two thirds of the cases of stone that have come under our notice in hospital practice are in children, and half of these are under five years of age. These young ones are, moreover, generally of a healthy and ruddy aspect, and form a contrast to those admitted for other diseases, the formation and presence of a stone in youug life being apparently not incompatible with good health. Causes of With respect to the causes of stone I concur, with Cadge, that Stone. “ it is safer to attribute lithuria to dyspepsia and mal-assimilation, which probably concerns all the digestive organs, than to fix the fault mainly on one,” and that this condition arises from the want of milk as an ordinary article of diet, for whilst in the children of the poor, stone in the bladder is so common as to constitute half the whole number of cases met with in practice, it is seldom seen in the more opulent classes.

When the calculus rests in the bladder and increases, it usually gives Symptoms, rise to more characteristic symptoms which differ widely in different subjects, and apparently have little to do with the nature of the stone. In some, indeed, in the majority of cases, the symptoms are so Slight, slight as to be disregarded, whilst in the larger number the symptoms have frequently existed for many months if not for years before advice is sought.

These symptoms, therefore, with tolerable accuracy denote the presence of a calculus, though its existence can only be affirmed posi- tively on its absolute detection by a sound. Yet nearly all the symptoms which have been enumerated can be produced by other and less important conditions, and more particularly by an elongated and adherent prepuce. Retention of urine in an otherwise healthy child is almost always Retention of caused by the impaction of a stone, and when incontinence exists, it urme' frequently indicates the presence of a calculus which has been forming ^“c^''.i|lleuce for a lengthened period, and which is often connected with renal as ° unne well as vesical changes of an organic character. In adult life, indifference to early symptoms is not common, and a frequent desire to pass water when persistent will soon induce a man to seek advice; and as this may be the only symptom of stone, it should neither be disregarded nor lightly treated. Indeed, with such a symptom, a sound should at once be passed, this being the readiest and best means of proving whether a stone be the cause or not. The symptoms that indicate the presence of a calculus will be found to vary, from the slightest irritation of the bladder to the severest agony, and those which have been described will be present in different degrees of severity or in different combinations. The importance, however, of an early detec- tion of a calculus is so great, that in every case of persistently irritable bladder which is not clearly the product of some other affection, it is detection of better to suspect the existence of a stone and examine with a sound stone than run the slightest risk of overlooking it, and consequently of imPortant- increasing the dangers (which are always great) of exciting or keeping F . . . up organic disease in the bladder and kidney. It is to be remembered £^““3 that the presence of a calculus is chiefly dangerous to life from the organic renal changes it is liable to excite; and that neither the operation of lithotrity nor lithotomy is commonly fatal if such changes have not taken place. The early detection of a stone becomes, therefore, neces- Confirmed sarily a point of the highest importance. symptoms of The confirmed symptoms of vesical calculus in the adult are, pain ad^t/’1STONE IN THE BLADDER. 92 Subjective symptoms.

Pain during and particularly after the act of micturition, extending along the urethra to the penis; exhausting straining, and the passage of blood. During the flow of urine, a sudden arrest of the stream will often be observed, this arrest being followed after the lapse of a moment of time by the return of the flow, and this inter- ruption may he repeated more than once in each act of micturition. Retention or incontinence of urine may complicate the case. Rectal irritation and tenesmus with or without prolapse are also frequent symptoms; and reflected pains along certain nerves are very constant. Thus, pain in the glans penis is most common, and pain in the scrotum, perinseum, and down the thighs. John Hunter relates a case of stone in which pain in the left forearm was the only indication of a want to make water. Sometimes the bladder symptoms may be severe for a time and then cease, or suddenly appear after any extra exertion. In the former case, the stone probably becomes fixed in a sacculus and ceases to irritate; in the latter, it escapes from a sacculus and makes its presence known. As long as the bladder remains healthy the changes in the urine will be but slight, but when the stone acting as a foreign body, sets up cystitis, all the symptoms of that affection will appear, with the muco-purulent discharge and ammoniacal urine. When the symptoms have existed for any lengthened period, the probabilities of renal complications are great, as indicated by albuminous urine with lumbar pain and anasarca. In rare cases, a persistent erection of the penis is present. But these symptoms of stone are merely subjective; they are those given by the patient; and, however suggestive of the affection they may be, are not conclusive, since all may be produced by other bladder affections. The only conclusive evidence to be obtained is by the physical examination of the bladder, by the “sounding” of the patient with a metallic sound or catheter, by the “ ringing ” of the stone against its end. To sound a patient suspected of stone, the horizontal position should be selected, and the pelvis raised on a pillow. The bladder should contain a few ounces of urine if possible, three or four being enough and eight being ample, and the rectum should be empty. When the bladder is empty, some few ounces of water should be injected. For a child, a small metallic bulbous catheter or sound with a short sharp curve should be used (Fig. 343), the bulbous end being one size larger than the stem, and for the adult, a similar instrument suffices (Fig. 342). An instrument with a long curve may glide over the. stone, and will certainly fail to find one lodged behind the prostate; it is, also, less movable. The short curved catheter can be made to turn downwards to explore the base of the bladder with the same facility as it can the sides. A hollow sound or catheter is better than a solid, as a stoue will often be detected on drawing off the urine, as the bladder in the act of contracting may throw the stone upon the end of the instrument, and thus make its presence known. The catheter should not have a \'he instrument should be warmed, freely oiled, and passed carefully and slowly into the bladder, nor ought its introduction to giveSTONE IN THE BLADDER. 93 pain Ifc should he at first pushed well home towards the posterior part of the organ to search its base, and then turned first to one side Fig. 342. and then to the other to search its sides, the sound during the operation being gradually withdrawn and again pushed back. When an enlarged ell|!^.ge(j prostate exists, and a stone is suspected to lie in a pouch behind the prostate so-called gland, the beak of the instrument must be turned backwards, exists, and in this way every corner of the bladder can be examined. When no “ring” of the calculus cau be obtained, the water may be partially drawn off, and by this manoeuvre success will often be the result. In examination children, the introduction of a finger into the rectum facilitates at times the search, and the pressure of the hand above the pubes, often facili- tates the detection of the stone. A large stone is generally touched on the sound entering the neck of the bladder, and a small one usually lies at the base of the bladder, either to the right or left of the median line. An encysted stone is a rarity. A stone may often be felt at one time and not at another: fscnPe consequently, w'hen well-marked symptoms exist any hasty opinion as to its absence is to be avoided. Mr. F. L’Estrange, of Dublin, has invented a sounding-board to be fastened to the top of the sound for intensifying the noise produced hy the instrument wdien it strikes a stone in the bladder. It is an ingenious instrument. Mr. Napier has invented a pewter sound the surface of which being oxidised by nitric acid is easily scratched when coming in contact with a stone. It seems to be of use wThen the stone is otherwise difficult of detection. For the same purpose the microphone may possibly prove of value. The operation of sounding ought to reveal something more, however, Ascertain than the presence of the stone, such as its size and nature, and whether size, nature more than one is present.

Experiments of Dr. Roberts. in facilitating the search for a stone, more particularly in children, is so great, that it should almost always be employed. In sounding, the surgeon must not be misled by the sensation given by the rugous or roughened bladder, the viscus feeling hard and uneven to the end of the sound, and the examination giving pain. When this condition is made out all sounding should be given up, for the existence of such with a stone is almost unknown. In children, the instrument may strike against the sacrum or spine of the ischium and mislead, but in this case there is no sound emitted; indeed, the surgeon must be careful to 'hear as well as to feel the stone before he is satisfied as to its presence, as there are many affections of the bladder and prostate that in their clinical history and physical symptoms simulate those of stone, but in none is any perceptible sound given when using the metallic instrument, as in stone. The only unequivocal sign of calculus is the sound produced on striking the stone. Informing a diagnosis, the surgeon should always remember that when irritation at the neck of the bladder arises from stone, it is referred to the glans penis; when from disease of the bladder, to the organ itself; and when from disease of the prostate, to the perinseum or rectum. When a calculus is suspected in the female, a vaginal examination will often enable the surgeon to feel the foreign body. It will also remove all such sources of fallacy as are prone to follow from uterine affections. In female children, a rectal examination will do as well. Treatment.—A calculus having been detected in the bladder,there is only one form of treatment which can be successful, and that is its removal; for, with rare exceptions, a stone, if allowed to remain, will set up, not only bladder disease, but kidney mischief, ending in death. A stone may be removed by a cutting operation, lithotomy; or by a crushing one, lithotrity; the treatment by lithontriptics and electro- lysis has hitherto met with indifferent success. In former times, small stones were removed from the bladder by forceps. Sir B. Brodie, Sir W. Blizard, Boyer, George Bell, and others, have recorded many such cases. Sir A. Cooper’s celebrated case, in which he removed eighty small stones by this means, is well known ; but the practice has been entirely superseded by the lithotrite. Lithontriptics, or stone solvents, were used long before the composi- tion of urinary calculi had been made known, and were mostly alka- line remedies; and the most celebrated nostrum of Joanna Stephens, for which the Government of 1739 gave a reward of £5000, was com- posed of burnt eggshells and snails, with Alicante soap. Prout showed the value of fluid as a solvent in calculous affections; Chevallier, of alkalies ; and Ch. Petit, more particularly of the Vichy springs. There can be no little doubt, too, that in the lithic acid form of stone, alka- lies have an undeniable influence in checking their increase, if not in aiding their solution. In other stones they have no such influence. Dr. Roberts, who has in recent years paid much attention to this sub- ject (‘Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1865), seems to think that “the results obtained by his experiments demand a considerable modification of the prevailing opinion regarding the inutility of the solvent treatment; they suggest an essential improvement in the treatment of renal calculi; theySTONE IN THE BLADDER. 95 indicate that uric acid and cystine, under certain circumstances, are capable of solution in the bladder, by means of alkaline salts adminis- tered by the mouth, at a rate which admits of practical application ; and that in picked cases a solvent treatment deserves to be resolutely tried.” He adds, however, “that the solvent treatment is only applicable in those cases of vesical calculi in which the urine is acid, the stone not large, its composition known to be uric acid, or strongly suspected to he such.” The best solvents are the acetate or citrate of potash, sufficient doses being given to make the urine neutral, not alkaline. Brodie showed that the injection into the bladder of a solution of Injections nitric acid, two or three minims to the ounce of water, had the power bladder, of dissolving phosphatic calculi; and, upon this suggestion, other ex- perimenters have tried other fluids, such as weak alkaline solutions for uric acid calculi, carbonate of lithia, borax, and acetate of lead, &c.; but there is this great disadvantage in the practice, that the solutions are apt to irritate the bladder and thus do more harm than good. In the uric acid and oxalate of lime calculi, they are almost useless. In the phosphatic stones, most surgeons admit the value of the practice, a solution of diluted nitric acid, 5ij to a pint of water, injected into a bladder where phosphates are being deposited being of great value in many cases. Such a practice must, however, be carried out with great caution. The aid of the galvanic battery has been employed to break up stones Galvanic by Dr. Bence Jones, Sir W. O’Shaughnessy, and others; but the success battery, attending the experiments has not been sufficient to warrant the recom- mendation of the means. Small stones may often he washed out of the bladder by means of Small calculi the urine; and patients who are prone to the passage of renal calculi m.ay Pass into the bladder, and to the formation of lithic acid or other gravel, ]|treain t"uH should be directed once a day, when the full bladder is about to discharge its contents, to arrest the flow of urine by holding the penis, and then suddenly to allow the stream to flow; in this way the water passing with a rush, carries away any small stone or sand that might be resting in the bladder. I have known this practice to be followed by good success. Old men should do this on their hands and knees. When a stone is too large to pass in this way, it must be removed, which is to be done by means of lithotomy or lithotrity. Lithotomy or Lithotrity in cases of Stone. Stone in the bladder in children may safely be treated by lithotomy. Lithotomy in It ought to be performed as soon as a stone has been detected in the children.' bladder, for the dangers of any individual case can be fairly measured by the size of the stone and the duration of the symptoms. The longer a calculus has existed, the greater are the probabilities of renal disease complicating the case; and the dangers of lithotomy, indepen- dently of its own special risks, are mostly due to the kidney' affection. When the stone is large, the neck of the bladder may be so injured as to set up a fatal peritonitis, and haemorrhage may, in exceptional cases, cause death; but in skilful hands, the operation of lithotomy, in patients under puberty, is most successful. Sir W. Fergusson informs us, in his College Lectures, that out of fifty Statistics cases of lithotomy in children, he lost only two. In my own prac- favo«rable.96 STONE IN THE BLADDER.

Lithotrity not applicable in severe bladder mischief. tice, out of upwards of thirty cases under puberty, I have lost but one, and then the patient was ten years old ; he had had symptoms all his life, and incontinence of urine for four years. The stone was two ounces in weight, and two inches in diameter. He died with peritonitis and extreme disorganisation of the kidney. In children, therefore, it may be safely asserted that success may with some confidence be looked for after lithotomy, when performed with care and skill. “ It may reasonably be doubted if better can be done before fifteen than cutting for stone.”—Fergusson. Lithotrity in a child, with fine instruments, may be a justifiable operation in exceptional cases when the calculus is known to be very small; but, as a rule, in patients under puberty, lithotomy ought to be selected. In Great Britain, this practice is generally followed by surgeons; although in France, lithotrity is more frequently selected. In stone in the bladder in adults, however, no such general rule can be laid down, although it may safely be asserted that, whenever a stone is found in the bladder of a male adult, its removal by lithotrity ought primarily to be entertained, and lithotomy had recourse to only when lithotrity is inapplicable. In tolerably healthy subjects, where the stone is small or of moderate dimensions, that is, about one inch in diameter, lithotrity is to be preferred to lithotomy, as the danger of lithotomy rapidly increases with age, the mortality being one in eight between seventeen and forty, one in four above that age. I have cut twenty- four adult male subjects with six deaths, or one in four; and Thompson out of seventy-eight cases lost twenty-nine, or one in two and three quarters. “ When lithotrity is employed for stones as large as a date or a small chestnut—and it is impossible to deny the excellent chance of success which this method offers to the subjects of such stones—a certain, but still only small proportion, of deaths must be expected; and the rate of mortality will correspond with augmentation in the size of the stones, and with the amount of existing disease and age on the part of the patient. Given a small stone in a fairly healthy person, and success is certain; the possibility of contingency in such a case depending only on the presence of those remote and excessively rare conditions which will make, for an individual here and there, the mere passing of a catheter a cause of death. In an adult subject, with a urethra of good calibre, and not over-irritable—with a prostate of normal size, or, if enlarged, not over-sensitive, or interfering with the passage of the lithotrite—with a bladder fairly healthy, and capable of containing at least four ounces of urine—a moderate stone, and a patient endowed with good health and an ordinary amount of pluck, the operation of lithotrity may be undertaken with every prospect of success.” “ It is, however, unwise to apply as a rule lithotrity to any stones above mode- rate size; and, if any calculus is sufficiently large to require what is known as the fenestrated instrument, it is better to employ lithotomy.” This is the conclusion of Sir H. Thompson after an experience of 422 cases of lithotrity with thirty-two deaths, or one in thirteen cases. (‘Med.-Chir. Trans.,’1878.) When severe bladder mischief complicates the case, lithotrity is out of the question, and lithotomy should be selected, although experience confirms what C. Hawkins has stated, that lithotrity may be performed with success when the bladder has been in a very considerable state of97 STONE IN THE BLADDER. irritation, and secreting much ropy mucus. The irritation and the secretion of mucus diminish as the operations are performed, and nearly cease before the whole of the calculus has been removed. These cases certainly require much caution in their management ; still they are by no means those in which lithotrity is to be rejected. When renal disease can be made out as existing, lithotrity is no more favorable an operation than lithotomy ; when associated with bladder complications, the cutting operation is probably the right one to adopt, even if only as a means of giving relief, although, when the stone is small and the renal symptoms uncertain, lithotrity may be undertaken with success. When the surgeon, however, on passing an instrument into the Fergusson’s bladder finds the urethra narrow and irritable, “ the neck of the views, bladder and mucous membrane particularly sensitive, the prostate somewhat large and so firm in substance that it has been difficult to pass a sharp-curved instrument; the bladder disposed to throw off its fluid contents; the stone large, perhaps more than one, and possibly withal an irritable temperament and a want of moral and physical courage, it is to me,” writes Fergusson (* Lect. on Prog, of Surg.,’ 1867), “ very doubtful if the operation of lithotrity should be re- sorted to;” although, he adds, “ it is remarkable how, in some, these conditions become modified by care and preliminary manipulative treatment.” Paralysis of the bladder does not positively preclude the practice of when lithotrity, though it necessitates extra care and gentleness in mani- paralysis of pulation, and may require the mechanical removal of the fragments by Judder, a scoop or Clover’s apparatus. (Fig. 319a.) An enlarged prostate, unless when mechanically interfering with the introduction of the instrument, is by enlarged no means an insuperable bar to lithotrity. prostate. “Formerly,” wrote Aston Key (1837, ‘Guy’s Reports’), “patients Key’s labouring under calculous disorders entertained a feeling of dread, f'.e[,lark3 011 almost amounting to horror, at the idea of having a stone in the bladder, andn™1 But since the introduction of lithotrity they no longer entertain the advantages, dread of their symptoms depending on the presence of a stone, and when the stone is found they cheerfully make up their minds to undergo an operation, which they regard as free from danger, and nearly so from pain. 1 have known a patient, and more than one, to be pleased with the discovery of a stone in the bladder, convinced, as he expressed it, that he could look for an easy cure from the new operation. The exaggerated statements of the advantages of lithotrity have, thus, not been unattended with good; they have been the means of inducing persons to come forward to obtain relief when the disease was incipient and the stone small. Since the introduction of lithotrity the surgeon examines the bladder with great care, knowing the importance of°dis- covering the calculus at the earliest period. The early symptoms of stone are thus watched with more jealousy on the part of the surgeon, and are not so scrupulously concealed by the patient. The advantages of an early knowledge of the existence of a stone, and of prompt measures for its removal, are known to both. The result of this is, that patients apply tor advice when the stone is small, the bladder uninjured by its pre- sence, and the kidneys free from disease. Tu three persons out of four who apply for advice for symptoms of calculus, the size of the stone VOL.

Summary. It would thus appear that in children, lithotomy ought to be the rule, aud lithotrity the exception. In adults, lithotrity ought to be the rule and lithotomy the exception—the latter operation being selected only when the former is impossible from some urethral or prostatic irrita- bility or mechanical obstruction, severe bladder disease, or a large stone. Renal disease in all cases renders doubtful the prognosis of any operative procedure, the weight of evidence tending in favour of a cutting rather than a crushing operation under such circumstances, though when the stone is small, lithotrity is not precluded. When In cases in which neither operation can be recommended, or when palliative both are rejected, it is wonderful how long patients, the subjects of be adopted*0 stone aU(l organic disease, by care and good advice will live, and how little irritation a calculus sometimes causes; and though the knowledge of this fact should not induce a surgeon to leave alone a patient who has a stone, it is enough to enable him to give hope and encourage- ment to one whose life would be endangered by any surgical attempt at its removal, for palliative treatment is, doubtless, a source of great comfort and a valuable means of prolonging life. LITHOTRITY. On lithotrity. “ In the whole of my professional experience,” says Fergusson in his rcs'ectim' it College Lectures, 1867, “ I know not of a useful operation which has irsprc mg . |)euu gQ shamefully overpraised, and thereby damaged in character as lithotrity. I know not any process in surgery requiring more fore- thought, knowledge, manipulative skill, and after-judgment.” “Nor is it possible,” writes Thompson, “to conduct all the manipulations with too much care and gentleness.” These opinions, emanating as they do from two of the most experienced lithotritists of the present day, ought always to be remembered, since they are true to a degree that surgeons only who have had some experience in the operation cau appreciate. To Mr. Elderton, a Northampton surgeon, is due the merit of being the first to construct an instrument for the purpose of crushing a calculus, and enabling the patient to pass it by the urethra When nrst (‘ Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal/ April, 1819); but lithotrity was first peiforme realised as an operation and successfully practised by Civiale in 1824, and to him the profession is chiefly indebted for the operation, though Leroy d’Etiolles, Heurteloup, Amussat, and others did much towards favouring the practice. It is probably, however, to Heurteloup Literature of that British surgeons are mostly indebted, as he came over to Eng- the subject. land about 1829'and explained fully to the profession the mechanism of his improved instruments and the steps of the operation, aud, on the invitation of Mr. Aston Ivey, this instruction was given in the theatre of Guy’s Hospital. Weiss, in 1823, had previously devised a screw lithotrite, and, after Heurteloup’s visit, and probably from information acquired through him, so improved it, that all modern instruments are based upon that which he thcu introduced. Aston Key, Brodie, Costello,99 LITHOTRITY. Hodgson, Fergusson, and others, subsequently practised the opera- tion, and, upon the result of their experience with that of Civiale, the operation has become a recognised one, the instru- ments employed having been vastly improved and their use better understood. In 1829 Aston Key read a paper on lithotrity at the Hunterian Society, and the report of a successful case, and in ‘ Guy’s Reports ’ for 1837 will he found a masterly paper upon the subject by the same surgeon. In 1834, Fergusson also wrote on lithotrity in the ‘ Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal,’ in which he introduced his rack lithotrite, and to him as well as to Sir B. Brodie, Sir H. Thompson, and Charles Hawkins, most of our modern improvements are due. In a former page, the difficult question was briefly discussed as to the class of cases in which lithrotrity should be selected, and in this the mode of operation, the preliminary and after-treatment, remain to be explained. For it may safely be stated, that no cases require more care- ful preparatory treatment and more cautious after-treatment than those now under consideration. Starting, therefore, with the assumption that our patient is middle- aged and healthy; the stone of moderate dimensions and not too hard ; the urethra of normal size; bladder healthy and capable of retaining easily about four or six ounces of urine—conditions under which operative interference ought to be most favourable—it is always well to keep the Cases patient quiet for a few days, and to test the urethra and bladder as favourable to their capabilities of bearing the mechanical irritation of the instru- lor lilllotri,.v ment by the introduction of a sound; attention should be paid at the same time to the condition of the secretions, &c. With every atten- tion, however, it is not uncommon to meet with cases in which the mere passage of a sound is followed by severe local and constitutional disturbance, and in lithotrity, such a complication is most detrimental. On the other hand, where irritability exists, the occasional introduction of an instrument is often followed by relief. When the bladder is inflamed and irritated by the presence of a Preliminary stone, rest is most essential, with the use of alkalies and the decoc- treatment, tion of the Triticum repens, or other drugs suitable for cystitis. When the urine is ammoniacal, the bladder should be emptied and washed out. By these means the symptoms may subside and the bladder become capable of retaining sufficient urine—four to six ounces—to allow of the operation being performed, where previously it would have been impossible. “If a stone be small, and it be possible to make away with it at a single operation, I should not mind advising lithotrity on a very brief acquaintance; but if the operation is likely to require two or more sittings, then I should think it wise of the surgeon to test, as it were, his patient’s constitution by a repeated preliminary use' of a bougie or sound.”—Fergusson. The patient having been prepared for operation by the treatment Preparation just laid down, the bowels cleared by a mild aperient or an enema the f°r operation, day. before, and the bladder sufficiently distended by the patient re- taining his urine as loug as he conveniently can before the surgeon’s visit, the operation may then be proceeded with.

Introduction The instrument, selected by the surgeon, having been previously well instrument warmed and oiled, is then to he carefully introduced, no force being employed, indeed, it may almost be allowed to fall into the bladder by its own weight, the surgeon simply guiding it. Mode of The bladder thus reached and the instrument pressed well into the seizing stone, organ, the object is to seize the stone, which can either be done by so depressing the lithotrite with its open blades as to allow of the stone falling between them, or by turning the open instrument to the stone and picking it up. The first is the older and the more usual method and the one 1 have commonly adopted, the second being useful where the first is inapplicable, where the prostate is enlarged, and the stone rests in a hollow behind it. It grows in favour with experience. Fig. 314. Operation of lithotrity. I give the first, or English method (Fig. 344), in Brodie’s words « the rule for seizing the calculus (which I must acknowledge to have first learned from witnessing the very dexterous operations, of Heurte- Tlie English loup) is as simple as possible. The patient lying on his back, the method, as handle of the forceps (lithotrite) is elevated, which, of course, brings, described by j]ie convex part of the curved extremity of it in contact with the Brodie. posterior surface of the bladder, where it is contiguous to the rectum. The forceps is then to be opened by withdrawing the sliding blade to a tereater or less extent, according to the probable size of the calculus, the fixed blade being at the same time pressed gently downwards in the direction of the rectum. The object of this manipulation is,LITHOTRITY. 101 that the forceps, being below the level of the other parts of the bladder, the calculus may fall into it by its own weight, and it is generally successful. If it should not do so, the forceps, without being moved from its situation, may be gently struck with the band on one side, or on its anterior part, and the slight concussion thus communicated to the bladder will probably be sufficient to dislodge the calculus, and bring it within the grasp of the instrument. If it should be otherwise, the forceps, being closed, may be very gently and cautiously turned to one side or the other, so that the curved ex- tremity of it may make an angle of 25° or even 30° with the vertical line of the body, then opened and pressed in the direction of the rectum in the manner already described.” “When the prostate gland is much enlarged there is sometimes a difficulty in seizing the calculus, arising either from it lying under that part of the gland which projects into the bladder or from the impedi- ment which it offers to the elevation of the handle of the instrument. For such cases the operating table invented by Heurteloup, which enables the patient’s shoulder to be suddenly lowered, is very conve- nient; or the same purpose will be answered sufficiently well if the patient be placed on a light sofa, the end of which may be raised by an assistant. The calculus is then seized, not in that part of the bladder which adjoins the rectum, but in the fundus, this being rendered the lowest point by the elevation of the pelvis.” The second mode of seizing the stone may be described as that of The French Civiale (Fig. 345). It is thus given by Sir II. Thompson:—“Its Method, as principle is the reverse of the preceding. By position of the patient, civile*'1 ^ the centre of the bladder and space beneath it are selected as the area of operation; no depression is made; contact between the walls of the bladder and the instrument is, as much as possible, avoided. The instrument is applied to the stone in the situation which this naturally takes, and the operator carefully avoids moving it, or any movements of concussion whatever, however slight. This improved method is in part due to the mechanical improvements which have been made in the lithotrite of late years. The method was scarcely possible until the present instruments existed.” “We shall now consider it in detail. The blades having entered the cavity of the bladder, the instrument slides easily and smoothly down the trigone, which in the living and healthy organ is an inclined plane, although quite otherwise in the atonied and in the dead bladder. In many cases the stone is grazed by the instrument as it passes, and the slightest lateral movement of the blades, right or left, will determine on which side it lies. If so, the operator is careful not to disturb it, but he in- clines the blades slightly away from the side on which it lies, carrying the instrument gently in towards the posterior wall of the bladder5, while the male blade is slowly withdrawn. It is important always to bear in mind that as long as the blades are near the neck of the bladder the male blade cannot bo withdrawn, since it would impinge on that sensitive part and cause pain or injury. Having done so, he now inclines the well-opened lithotrite towards the stone, slowly closes, and almost certainly seizes it.” “But sup- r ■ pose no stone was felt on entering, he is then directed simply further8 to withdraw the male blade an inch or more in the middle Hue, description, to incline the blades to the right side about 45°, and then to closeLITHOTRITY. 102 them, without altering the axis of the shaft, or otherwise disturbing the central position of the instrument. Thus, in almost all positions, the stone is seized sideways by the blades of the lithotrite, and very rarely by their extremities. If no stone is felt, he then turns them, opened, to the left in a similar manner, and then closes them. Observe, that the blades are always to be opened before they are turned, for this reason; if the turn is first made and the blades are subsequently opened, the chance is that the male blade, as it is withdrawn, will move the stone away ; whereas, if the blades are inclined rvhile open, the stone, if there, is almost certainly seized. This is one of the many apparently minute Fig. 345. Operation of litliotrity. but extremely important points of which systematic litliotrity is made up. To return, it is very rare that the stone will elude the search thus far, hut if it does, depress the handle of the lithotrite half an inch or so, which raises the blades very slightly from the floor of the bladder, and turn them another 45° to the left, bringing, in fact, the blades horizontally to the left; close; if successful, turn them gently Five positions to horizontal in the right, and close. These five positions vertical, in which r;„^t an(j ieft incline, right and left horizontal, explore the bladder fully, detected^ bC middle, right aud left, and will almost certainly find any stone of mode- rate size in a healthy bladder. The object is, at the same time, strictly to avoid communicating any jerk to the instrument or to the bladder. In all these movements, if properly executed, there has been barely contact of the lithotrite with the vesical walls; at all events, no pressure, nothing to provoke undue pain, or cause contractions of the bladder. If, however, there is an enlarged prostate, causing an emi- nence at the neck of the bladder, or depression behind it, or the stone is very small, or we are exploring for some fragment, at the close of the case, which is suspected to have eluded previous search, the blade may be reversed so as to point downwards to the floor, and the object sought may then often be secured with ease. If seeking for a103 LITHOTRITY. small stone or for fragments, we shall employ a lithotrite with short When ^ blades, which can, therefore, be reversed with much greater ease than |nfa.lV's10?ics. one with long blades. “ In order to do this properly in the normal bladder, the handle of the lithotrite is depressed another iuch or so between the patient’s thighs, so that the line of the instrument, instead of being directed obliquely a little upwards, is level with, or even points a little below, the horizon; the blades, supposed to have been already brought to the horizontal, as before described, are cautiously turned about 45°, say, to the right (right reversed incline), so as to point obliquely to the floor, which should be barely felt or very lightly touched by them. No pressure should be made on this part of the bladder by any part of the instrument, and it is easily avoided by depressing sufficiently the handle of the lithotrite; then close the blades; next turn them back, that is upwards, over to the left (left reverse incline), and close. Lastly, they may be brought round to the reversed vertical position, and the floor lightly swept; this requires the maximum depression of the handle, and is only necessary to pick up small fragments with a short-bladed instrument. But when the prostate is considerably en- when larged, and a stone or fragments have to be sought behind it, the enlarged lithotrite is reversed without depressing the handle. prostate. “ All these movements are to be executed at or beyond the centre of Civiale’s the vesical cavity, the proper area for operating, without hurry, rapid instructions movement, or any other which partakes of the nature of a jerk or con- manipulating cussion, and, if in a fairly healthy bladder, without causing more than the lithotrite a very slight degree of pain to the patient. The operator’s eye is also 'vill‘ blades, to be so familiar with the scale marked on the sliding rod, that he knows at a glance the exact interval which it indicates as existing between the blades in the bladder. It is essential to good practice, while manipu- lating the lithotrite, to maintain the axis of the instrument as far as possible always in the same direction. The blades only are to be moved; the shaft should occupy the same inclination, unless when this is intentionally altered. In screwing home the small blade the ope- rator is very apt to move tin? lithotrite also at each turn of the screw, unless he is conscious of the care necessary to avoid the evil. All lateral movements, all vibration and concussion, necessarily tell on the neck of the bladder and prostatic urethra, where the instrument is most closely embraced and its mobility is most limited. To that part of the lithotrite which occupies the anterior portion of the urethra much free- dom of lateral movement is permitted, and in the bladder the instru- ment is free, although in a less degree; but the axis or fixed point, as regards lateral movement, is at the part indicated, which is also the most sensitive spot of the entire passage. Hence the aim of the ope- Lithotrite rator should be to produce in this situation no motion of the lithotrite sl,ould only except that on its own axis. Few of the details of the operation “‘^ea“"slls require more practice to master than this. “ There is one important rule with reference to the situation of the Rule in calculus in the bladder. The larger it is the more certain it is to be relerence to found lying near the neck of the bladder in the ordinary recumbent of position, while a small one is usually detected at the back of the trigone. This position of the large stone requires a different method, and it wili When stone be found almost invariably successful.

First, let the blades be inclined away from the side on which the stone is felt, then push on the female portion of the instrument only, by itself, as far as it will go, maintaining the male blade at the neck of the bladder; it is now only necessary to incline towards the stone, and it will be seized almost certainly at once. But if the operator com- mences by pushing on the whole instrument, and then withdraws the male blade, according to tbe ordinary custom, the blade is infallibly drawn against the large stone, which it therefore fails to catch, and presses it back against the neck of the bladder producing pain, irrita- tion, and perhaps bleeding; this is a practical rule of importance.” Such, then, in the main, is the method of Civiale for finding the stone. It is, doubtless, an admirable one, and, in skilled hands, is at least equal to the English method. For my own part, I have a preference for the English plan, having been originally taught it by Mr. Aston Key. and practised it since with good success. I have, how- ever, followed Civiale’s method when the prostate was large, and the stone failed to fall readily into the open blades of the instrument, also in crushing fragments. In fact, the practical surgeon must understand both methods, and employ one or other according to the necessities of the case in hand. Where gentleness is carried out and the bladder is not pressed upon or irritated by the instrument, either method is good; without gentleness and discrimination both are equally inju- rious. In the English plan, the main point to observe, is to maintain the female blade as quiet as possible, and sufficiently depressed to allow of the male blade being drawn forward without affecting the neck of the bladder. With this caution a large stone may be crushed with but little pain or vesical irritation; without it, the first attempt to open the lithotrite will be resisted by the bladder, and the intention of the operator frustrated. The stone having been seized—its size gauged by tbe markings on the handle of the instrument—it is to be crushed, and when the irrita- tion caused by the operation is slight, this may be repeated three, four, or more times; under other circumstances, one or two crushings are sufficient. Where the bladder is irritable, the stone of good size, and it is probable that several operations will be required, it is possibly a wise plan to do but little at the first sitting; looking upon it as a ten- tative step, and, when no bad result follows, the second operation may be more prolonged and effectual. When the stone is small, one sitting will often suffice to crush it up. I have, however, on several occasions, in healthy subjects with sound bladders, been tempted to crush into fragments at one sitting, stones upwards of an inch in diameter, and have had no reason to regret it. Indeed, on this point no general law can be laid down. What may be wise in one case would be indiscrete in another, and what may safely be undertaken under certain circumstances would be hazardous under others. Iu a middle-aged adult, with a healthy bladder and prostate, a large stone may often be rapidly crushed. In an old man with an enlarged prostate, the sittings ought always to be short. When the bladder is irritable, little should be done at one sitting. When the reverse, more may be undertaken with confidence. On removing the lithotrite, the surgeon should observe that the male blade is screwed well home.LITHOTRITY. 105 Opinions differ with respect to the removal of the fragments; most Opinions surgeons prefer leaving this to the natural action of the bladder, and renfovHl'cff in this view my own opinions tend, and I have usually practised it, fragments, hut Sir W. Fergusson advocated instrumental interference. “ I have generally,” he wrote, “ as a first step introduced a lithotrite of considerable size, equal to a No. 10 or 11 bougie, and broken the stone into various fragments. Next I have taken the smaller lithotrite, attacked these fragments, and then have used a small scoop, with the Use of small object of removing several fragments, so that the patient might have 3^Oop 1 '" satisfactory evidence that the stone had been crushed. In a few days after, the small crusher and scoop have again been used, particularly the scoop, wherewith the fragments, when found sufficiently small, have been extracted singly or two or three at a time. Thus, instead of waiting for the spontaneous escape of the broken portions, a process usually both uncertain and tardy, they have been got rid of by direct and precise surgical interference. By this means a stone may be removed with a rapidity little short of the time needful for lithotomy.” “ Occasionally, when over-anxious for a rapid cure, I have extracted fragments rather too large to come rapidly along the urethra, par- ticularly in the prostatic or membranous portion, or at the triangular ligament. In some, when the urethra nearest the neck of the bladder has been rather roughly used, there has been considerable irritation.” But “in many instances I have been able to effect one or two opera- tions within ten days, which, according to custom, would take weeks or possibly months.” In paralysis of the bladder this practice is also proved by Fergusson to be of great value; indeed, he states that “ such a condition is positively favourable to that process, for there is generally in such cases an apathetic state of the mucous membrane which permits of the free use of instruments required for the removal of fragments.” That the process must be fol- lowed with caution, the experience of the able surgeon I have quoted is a sufficient proof. On his high authority I now recom- mend it. In the majority of the cases of lithotrity that have fallen into my Discharge of hands, I have left the discharge of the fragments to natural pro- fragments cesses, and had no reason to regret it. In all, success followed the *efttonatural practice. In one only have I subsequently had to perform lithotomy. 1 Where the prostate is enlarged and the fragments prevented from passing, Fergussou’s plan of removing them by the scoop or small lithotrite is a good one, and, for the same purpose Clover’s ingenious instrument (Fig. 319a) may be used. It is based on the same principle as one employed by Sir P. Crampton and is a catheter with a large eye to admit fragments, fitted closely into a glass receiver, and an ex- hausting india-rubber bottle at the end. 1 have used this on many b, occasions with satisfactory success. I adopt at times the practice instruments. I have been in the habit of using for washing out the bladder, and employ a long piece of tubing fitted on to the end of the catheter, the tubing acting as a syphon and evacuating the contents of the bladder with great facility (Fig. 321). I am disposed to think this method may be practised more extensively with advantage. Since writing this, I find Professor Dittel, of Vienna, has advocated a like practice (‘ Practitioner,’ March, 1871).106 LITHOTRITY. Treatment after the operation of lithotrity. When a second operation to be performed. On chloroform in lithotrity. Selection of instrument to be employed. The sitting having been brought to a close, the patient should be well covered up in bed, and a tumblerful of warm wine-and-water, or brandy-and-water given, this practice having a tendency to check the rigor that so often follows the operation. The patient should not, if possible, make water for some short time afterwards, and he should then make it in the recumbent posture, care being taken that the chamber into which the water passes is covered with a layer of muslin to catch such fragments of stone as may pass. After twelve hours of the recumbent position, if no unusual irrita- bility of bladder exists, the patient may get up. The second operation may be performed within three or four days of the first when no bladder symptoms exist; but where these are pre- sent, or have become aggravated, a longer interval should be allowed; a week or ten days being sufficient. The same may be said for all sub- sequent sittings. When a fragment becomes impacted in the urethra and produces retention, it should either be gently pushed back into the bladder with a large catheter or removed with urethral forceps. These fragments not only produce retention at times, but epididymitis, from irritation of the caput gallinaginis. With respect to the use of chloroform in lithotrity, there can be no doubt that it may under some circumstances be given with great ad- vantage, although when the patient has good pluck, there is no reason why it should be administered; but the same care and gentleness should be observed in an unconscious as in a conscious subject, and with it, no more harm to the bladder is likely to accrue. With respect to the nature of the implements employed in crushing a stone, lightness combined with strength are the two essentials; each part should work very smoothly upon the other, and the means em- ployed to change the action of the instrument from the sliding move- ment of the blades to the screw should be as simple as possible. Civiale originally employed a three-pronged instrument, but at the present time the screw, as originally invented by Hodgson, improved by Weiss, and adopted by Sir B. Brodie, Key, and others, is the more common form of mechanical power employed. The mode of its applica- tion, however, has been greatly improved in recent times, the instruments of Weiss, Charriere, and Matthews supplying us with everything the surgeon could desire. One made by Matthews, of Carey Street, and figured below, is the one I prefer. It is based on the movement em- ployed by Charriere and Weiss, and has a movable handle, which enables the surgeon, when employing the English mode of seizing the stone, to keep the female blade of the instrument perfectly steady. The instrument is worked by the screw, and the change from the screw to the sliding movement is made rapidly by simply moving the thumb- plate—this plate being fixed in the required position by screw catches (Fig. 346). The blades of the instrument may be either fenestrated at their ends to facilitate the breaking of the calculus, though such instruments are not now much employed; or flattened and plain, with roughened male blades for powdering or crushing the pieces. These latter instruments, made very small and slight, have been called scoops. Sir W. Fergusson used the rack-and-pin instrument he invented in 1834, and it is very serviceable. In his hands it answered everyLITHOTOMY. 107 purpose, as it would in any other hands had they sufficient practice to render its application easy; for in lithotrity more than in any Fig. 346.

A complete description of every form of lithotrite employed, as well as a history of the operation, can be found in Sir H. Thompson’s admirable work on lithotomy and lithotrity. LITHOTOMY. In children, where lithotrity is inapplicable, and in adults, when lithotrity, for reasons already given, ought not or cannot be ap- plied, lithotomy must be employed, and lateral lithotomy is doubt- less the best, as it is the most usual operation. “ In children it is Lithotomy in difficult to mention any operation in surgery so uniformly successful as children, lithotomy is. The incomplete development, and the consequently little susceptibility of the parts involved—the small size of the vessels, and the little risk of haemorrhage—the yielding nature of the textures, rendering force unnecessary in the extraction of the stone—are cir- cumstances that combine to divest the operation of much of the danger that surrounds it when performed in the adult. From childhood to the age of puberty the dangers can hardly be said to increase. Boys of thirteen years of age suffer scarcely more from the operation than children, and for the same reason. Seeing, then, that so little risk and suffering attends lithotomy in children, it is difficult for us to find an equally safe and efficient substitute; it can scarcely, indeed, be said to be required.”—Aston Key. In the adult male, lithotomy is rarely resorted to until the surgeon Lithotomy in becomes convinced that the removal of the stone by lithotrity is inap- adults.

Lateral lithotomy. Key’s operation. Statistics. Statistics in children. Description of Key’s operation. the adult admitted, half only have been subjected to lithotomy. In private practice, the proportion of cases of lithotomy to lithotrity is much smaller, patients applying for advice at an earlier period. From this fact, the worst cases of stone are alone submitted to the cutting operation, and, as a consequence, the mortality is high. “ It is probable,” writes Birkett, ‘ Guy’s Rep.,’ 1867, “ that the rate of mortality after lithotomy must henceforth always appear higher than formerly, in consequence of so many of the patients suffering with stone who might have been cut successfully, being those now selected for the performance of lithotrity. In point of fact, the very cases which swelled the list of successful results no longer appear in the category of those submitted to the cutting operation; but, on the contrary, those patients too ill to recover from lithotrity frequently, as a last resource, submit to lithotomy and perish.” At Guy’s, lithotrity being the rule in adults and lithotomy the exception, the mortality of the latter operation in adults is one in three, whereas in places where, lithotrity is little practised, it is one in five. Lateral lithotomy, or the operation of Raw, Jaques, and Cheselden is, without doubt, the favourite means of extracting a stone from the bladder among modern surgeons, assuming that lithotrity is inap- plicable or inadvisable. As an operation, it has been nobly planned ; and to see it performed with skill and precision is still a sight which affords gratification to the youngest as well as the oldest surgeon. In my student days, to see Aston Key cut for stone was an event which I now fondly think over with pleasure and admiration; and the memory of the skill and precision of his acts in this, as in all other operations, is still before me as a standard of perfection at which all should aim. These remarks are not inapplicable as a preface to the subject of lateral lithotomy; for Key’s use and advocacy of the straight staff in that operation have so influenced all his successors that up to the pre- sent day “ Key’s ” operation is the one usually performed at Guy’s, the exceptions to this rule being so rare as not to be named. The success which has attended this practice has been very good; when, indeed, compared with that furnished from other sources, it seems so remarkable that it is difficult to arrive at any other conclusion than that the mode of operation has something to do with it; for, taking the most reliable statistics—the Norwich 408 cases, in subjects under puberty, and Thompson’s 868, eliminating the Guy’s cases—the mor- tality was 1 in every 14J cases; whilst of Guy’s cases and Key’s operation during seventeen years, 8 deaths occurred in 171 cases, that is, 1 in 57 cases, the success being four times greater. In children under five years of age, these points are still more strongly marked, as out of 400 cases tabulated by Thompson, the mortality was 1 in every 13£; the Norwich not being quite so good; whilst at Guy’s, after Key’s operation, in my old table, it was 1 in 23£ out of 73 cases, and more recently, during seventeen years, ending in 1874, 100 patients have been cut consecutively without a death. This success is certainly more striking than I anticipated when I began the comparison, and must in a measure, if not altogether, be ascribed to the greater safety of Key’s operation. I propose now to describe the operation of lateral lithotomy, and I shall do so after what I believe to be the best method, that of “ Key,”LITHOTOMY. 309 giving also that with the curved staff. But, first of all, as to the instru- ments required. . , . ,, The staff, whether straight, as in Key’s operation, curved as in others Fig. 347. (Fig. 347), or rectangular, must he regarded as a director. It is a means the surgeon employs to guide his knife into the bladder, and I may say with Key, that “ the advantage of a straight over a curved line as a conductor to a cuttiug instrument is too obvious to require any comment. Is it surprising that the blind should err in a crooked path ?” Key’s staff is blunt-pointed as a sound, and more deeply grooved than the common staff, to prevent any risk of the knife slip- ping out; the grove is in the centre of the staff, not at one side as in the ordinary curved one, and it runs to within half an inch of the end. “ Its chief superiority,” writes Key, “ consists in allowing the surgeon to turn the grove in any direction he may wish.” The staff must vary in length and size according to the age of the patient and size of the urethra, it being well to use as large a one as will pass readily down the urethra. The knife varies much with the fancy of the operator. That em- ployed by Key (Fig. 348) and his successors resembles in form a com- Fig. 348. raon scalpel, but is longer in the blade, and slightly convex in the back near the point, to enable it to run with more facility in the Instruments.

The knife as employed by Sir W. Fergusson (Fig. 348) is given as a type of that required for the curved staff. A probe-pointed bistoury or blade with a round point is sometimes of use to enlarge the vesical opening when not made free enough, or, to give vent to a large stone. Lithotomy forceps should be made of several shapes and sizes, and a scoop (Fig. 349) ought also to be at hand. It is used by passing it Fig. 349. Lithotomy scoop. behind the stone and fixing it there by the pressure of the left index- finger, the instrument with the two hands being withdrawn with the stone. When the perinseum is very deep, and some extra guide is required by the surgeon for the introduction of his forceps into the bladder and the extraction of the stone, the blunt gorget (Fig. 350) may be used, the instrument, guided by its beak, being passed into the bladder upon the staff, and upon this the forceps can readily be introduced. The gorget is never needed in children, but in adults it is often of great use. Fig. 350. The blunt gorget. The operation.—The surgeon having decided upon his operation selected his instruments, and seen that he has at hand everything he may require, having also obtained the help of three if not four assistants besides the chloroformist, proceeds to place his patient. A narrow but well-raised table should be employed, so that the patient’s perinseum and the surgeon’s face should be nearly on the same level. The patient should be placed on his back with his thighs flexed upon the pelvis and the legs upon the thighs, the hands of the patient being made to grasp his feet, and fastened in such a position by the figure-of-8 bandage, the padded bracelets and anklets, as seen in Fig. 351, or Clover’s crutch. The neck ligature is never required. Children need not be fastened, but it is more prudent for adults; although some surgeons, since the introduction of chloroform, have given up the practice under all circumstances. The shoulders should be well raised, the knees separated, and the pelvis kept well down upon the table by two assistants; the surgeon should also see that the patient is quite straight, the line of the umbilicus being the best guide to this position. The perineeum should be perpen- dicular. The surgeon may then pass the staff, and having introduced it well into the bladder, and felt as well as heard the stone, he is to entrust it to the hands of an assistant, one who can confidently beIll LITHOTOMY. relied upon to hold it in the position in which the surgeon has placed Position ol it, and who will not draw it forwards in any degree. This point is of importance, for there is good reason to believe, that many of the mishaps connected with the operation are due to the staff having been partially withdrawn from the bladder by an assistant, who perhaps in stooping forward, tries to get a sight of the ope- rator’s movements. When the straight staff is used, it is to be held well up, with the handle slightly tilted towards the operator; and, when the curved staff is employed, some surgons like it to be well hooked up against the symphysis, but, under all circumstances, it is to be held steadily. The surgeon will probably have seen that the perinreum has been shaved, and before he operates have examined the prostate per rectum and scanned the perinmum. The operator may then proceed with the first step of the operation, viz. to lay bare the staff, to expose the groove First step of of the director that is to guide his knife into the bladder; and the operation, point at which this opening is desired is at the membranous portion behind the bulb and in front of the prostate; Blizard, Martineau, Stanley, Key, and Fergusson, all laying stress upon this important point. With this view, the perineal incision is to be made, and in Perineal lateral lithotomy this is usually situated on the left side, the line of incision, incision lying from the left of the median line of the perinaeum down- wards, backwards, and outwards, midway between the anus and the left tuber ischii. The incision is usually from three to three and a half inches long. Some surgeons commence the cut an inch in front of the anus; others fix it at one and a quarter to one and three quar- ters, but this point is not one of primary importance. The object of the incision is to make a free external opening, to enable the surgeon to reach the groove of the staff at the part indicated, and allow sub- sequently of the removal of the stone, and a point midway between the scrotum and anus is probably the best guide to follow; the length of the perineal region varying greatly in different subjects. In making this perineal incision, the left thumb of the operator should be firmly fixed above the point at which the knife is to be introduced; and it is well for the surgeon with the finger of the left hand, to hold the staff firmly at the root of the penis at the same time. The point of the knife may be well introduced into the soft parts in the line of the director, and the tissues freely divided in the cut downwards, a second or third touch of the knife being made to com- plete the section. If these be made too low the rectum is liable to be wounded. In this incision the perineal triangle and ischiorectal space are laid open, and the skin and fascia with the transverse perineal muscle and its artery divided. Fig.351.LITHOTOMY. 112 Second step of operation In Key’s operation. Section of prostate. The surgeon having exposed the groove of the director (staff) that is to guide his knife into the bladder, should then proceed to the second step of the operation. For this purpose, when the curved staff is used, he should introduce the forefinger of his left hand into the wound, and feel for the staff behind and to the left of the bulb, and having clearly made out the two edges of the groove and along his nail between them, he should introduce the point of his knife upon the nail of the finger into the groove, and having clearly divided the tissues sufficiently to make him confident that the point of the knife is well into the groove of the staff, complete his deep section by pushing the knife along the groove of the staff into the bladder, lateralising it to divide the left lobe of the prostate and neck of the bladder sufficiently (Fig. 352). This step being performed in Key’s operation as follows : — “ The point of the knife being kept steadily against the groove, the operator with his left hand takes the handle of the director, and ITo. 352. Lateral lithotomy with a curved staff. lowers it till he brings the handle to the elevation described in Fig. 353, keeping his right hand fixed; then with an easy, simultaneous movement of both hands the groove of the director and the edge of the knife are to be turned obliquely towards the patient's left side; the knife, having the proper bearing, is now ready for the section of the prostate; at this time the operator should look to the exact line the director takes, in order to carry the knife safely and slowly along the groove, which may now he done without any risk of the point slipping out.”—Key. “ In the majority of cases it will merely he necessary to pass the knife along the director, and having cut the prostate to withdraw it without carrying it out of the groove, varying the angle according to the age of the patient, the width of the pelvis, and size of the stone. As the direction in which the prostate should be divided, in order to adhere to Cheselden’s operation, is obliquely downwards and outwards, increas-113 LITHOTOMY. ing the angle at which the knife enters the bladder will incur no risk of wounding the pudic artery. The knife may be conducted with deliberate care into the bladder, the resistance afforded by the prostate will be readily felt, and the hand of the operator should be checked as soon as he feels the prostate has given way.”—Key. The surgeon knows when he has entered the bladder by the absence of resistance, and occasionally by a rush of urine. He should remem- ber, however, that some urine will escape so soon as the urethra has been opened, and not be misled by the fact. The angle which the knife makes with the staff, regulates the size of the incision into the neck of the bladder. When the knife is in a line with the staff, the incision will be limited; the larger the angle the knife makes with the staff, the larger will be the wound. As a rule, a large wound can be of no advantage unless the stone is Size of very large. A small wound, however, is a disadvantage when the stone wound, is of medium size; for although the neck of the bladder is capable of a good deal of dilatation under moderate force, any severe laceration of the prostate is almost certain to be followed by bad results. Surgeons, differ much upon this point, some recommending dilatation in pre- Lateral lithotomy with Key’s straight staff.

Moderate dilatation is certainly free from risk ; while severe dilata- tion is dangerous, in-as-much as it necessitates great laceration. As a rule the incision should never exceed the limits of the prostate.

The forceps, held in the surgeon’s right hand, is then passed into the wound upon the left index-finger, and, guided by it, pushed into the opening, the forceps being introduced into the bladder at the moment the finger is withdrawn. “Having delivered his knife to the assistant, the operator takes the staff in his right hand, and passing the forefinger of his left along the director through the opening in the prostate, withdraws the director, and exchanges it for the forceps, passes the latter upon his finger into the cavity of the bladder.” “ In extracting the calculus, should the aperture in the prostate prove too small, and a great degree of violence be required to make it pass through the opening, it is advisable always to dilate with the knife rather than expose the patient to the inevitable danger consequent on laceration.”—Key. The forceps should be full-sized, and introduced into the bladder closed fiat upon the stone, and immediately opened, the stone generally being at once caught in the blades, the rush of urine carrying it towards the wound. The stone should be grasped boldly, and when seized, be slowly and deliberately extracted, the extracting force being made in the direction of the axis of the pelvis downwards and backwards, and then forwards; a little rotatory and side-to-side motion of the instrument at times facilitates the extraction of a calculus, the surgeon at the same time with his index-finger pushing the soft parts off the stone. Before extracting, the operator by the sensation given to the forceps, will assure himself that the bladder is not caught. It is in this third step of the operation that the surgeon frequently meets with his difficulties, and much discretion and fertility of resource are often needed to overcome them, since no definite rules can he laid down as a guide. The stone may elude the grasp of his instrument; sometimes it clings to the bladder above the wound behind the symphysis, and is thus without the reach of the instrument; at others, it is caught in the fundus, under which circumstances the pressure of the hand of an assistant above the pubes becomes of value, or, the injection of a stream of water is advantageous. Occasionally, although rarely, the stone may be encysted. At times, when the stone is very small, it may be washed out with the first rush of urine, and conse- quently not felt. I have seen this happen in a child. At times a bladder may be opened and no stone found; “ but from all my expe- rience,” writes Sir W. Fergusson, “ I feel justified in stating my con- viction that most of the cases heretofore related as instances where the incisions for lithotomy have been made, and a stone has not been present, have been examples where the surgeon has failed to reach the bladder.” In children, tins is particularly the case, the surgeon pushing the bladder inwards off the staff. This accident is liable to occur when the neck of the bladder is not sufficiently opened. After the removal of the stone, the finger or sound should be introduced into the bladder to ascertain the existence or non-existence of a second. Fergusson describes the operation as follows :— The breech should now be brought to the margin of the table, when the assistant who has charge of the staff should be desired toLITHOTOMY. 115 hold that instrument in his left hand, nearly perpendicularly with the Fergusson’s concavity of the curve touching the upper part of the triangular liga- ment, and to draw the scrotum slightly upwards and a little to the right side with his right hand, while he stands on the patient’s right side. Then the surgeon should seat himself in front of the perinseum, having previously arranged with an assistant about having the instru- ments handed to him, or having already assorted them properly in a chair at his side. Now it may be well to pass the forefinger of the left hand, oiled, into the rectum to ascertain the size of the prostate, and also the depth of this organ from the surface; next, having with- drawn his finger, he should trace the course of the ramus of the pubes and ischium on the left side, ascertain the position of the tuberosity of the latter bone on each side, and having scanned the whole surface, should proceed to use the knife, holding it as he would a scalpel or bistoury as represented in Fig. 352. The point of the blade should be entered about one inch and three fourths in front of the anus, about a line’s breadth left of the raphe, pushed through the skin and carried by a kind of sawing motion down the left side of the perinaeum, about an inch and a quarter beyond the anus, the middle of the incision being at equal distances from the latter part and the tuberosity; next the blade should run along the surface of the exposed fat and cellular tissue, and then the point of the forefinger of the left hand should be thrust into the wound a little in front of the anus, so as to penetrate between the accelerator urin® and the erector penis muscles, the knife being applied to any part which offers resistance, when, with a little ;orce to separate the tissues, the top of the finger can be placed upon the membranous portion of the urethra, and the groove in the staff may be distinctly felt. The point of the blade, with the flat surfaces nearly horizontal (Fig. 352), should now be carried along above the inger, made to perforate the urethra about three lines in front of the prostate, and then be slid along the groove until it has entered the bladder, having slit open the side of the urethra and notched the mar- gin of the prostate in its course. If the stone is supposed to be of sonsiderable magnitude the blade should, in withdrawing it, be carried i little out of the groove so as to increase the incision of the prostate. The forefinger of the left hand should next be slipped slowly into the fladder along the staff, in such a manner as to cause dilatation of the mrrounding textures, and its point should be moved about in search of he stone, which being found should be retained in a position near the teck of the viscus; then the assistant should be desired to remove the taff, and the surgeon should introduce the forceps along the upper urfaee of the finger, slowly withdrawing the latter as the former nakes progress; their entrance will be denoted by a gush of urine, at finch instant the blades should be separated, when on gently approxi- mating them the stone will, in all probability, be felt enclosed; if it s not, the process may be repeated if the water still flows, but should he bladder now be empty the closed blades should be quietly moved bout the bladder until the stone is touched, and at this time, in open- lg and closing them, great care should be taken to avoid auy injury j the bladder. To make sure that the membrane has not been grasped ; is well to move the forceps a little before commencing extraction, hen, if all is right, the process should be effected by a slow zigzag lovement in a direction towards the floor, and with a slight pullingLITHOTOMY. 116 After- treatment.

Extraction being effected, the operation is completed.” As soon as the operation has been completed, the patient should be unbound and any bleeding vessels twisted. In children, the introduc- tion into the wound of a piece of ice, or the application to the wound of a cold sponge, with or without ice, is usually enough to arrest any hx- morrhage, and, in the adult, the same practice, as a rule, suffices. When, however, the haemorrhage is persistent, a piece of sponge or a sponge tent should be introduced into the wound up to the neck of the bladder; such a proceeding arrests bleeding, though not the flow of urine, which percolates through the sponge. The sponge may be removed at the end of twenty-four hours. This practice is strongly advocated by my col- league, Mr. Cock. Liston was in the habit of introducing a gum-elastic tube, six inches long, through the wound into the bladder, to carry off the urine for the first two days, and fastening it in with tapes. This practice is still followed by some. It is, however, quite unnecessary; and at Guy’s we use the tube only in exceptional cases—that is, when severe haemorrhage ensues, the wound being plugged around it. Dupuy- tren employed the same kind of tube, to which was attached a circular piece of oil silk at its centre like an unribbed umbrella; sponge or charpie was introduced between the tube and silk when bleeding took place, after the upper end of the tube had been intro- duced through the wound into the bladder. Matthews has adapted an india-rubber bag around the tube, which can be introduced into the bladder empty, and then expanded with air and water. It answers the same purpose as Dupuytren’s canule a chemise, and is, probably, more efficient. In exceptional cases, when the bulb is cut into, it may be necessary to apply pressure with the finger on the pudic artery to arrest bleeding. The patient having been placed in a bed, a good draw sheet should be placed beneath his hips and a pillow behind his knees to keep them flexed, while the knees should not be tied together. A sedative may be em- ployed to give rest, but beyond this, little or no medical treatment is required. The diet should be nutritious but unstimulating, and wine and meat given as soon as the appetite demands. The bowels, if not acting naturally on the fifth or sixth day, should be cleared by an enema or mild aperient, such as castor oil, and the horizontal position should be maintained till the wound has closed. Key has remarked that in children partial incontinence is apt to follow when this rule has not been observed. Sources of difficulty in Lithotomy, and how to avoid them. The difficulties connected with the operation are too often due to carelessness and too great speed, consequently they are mostly of the surgeon’s own making. If, however, he feels the stone and hears its ring before operating, he is sure of its presence, and knows also that the staff is in the bladder, and that it has not passed through any false passage in the urethra or between the bladder and rectum. If, moreover, before cutting he assures himself by touching the staff that it has not been displaced he has a direct guide down to the calculus.LITHOTOMY. 117 If when cutting, after having exposed the groove of the staff, and then Care that proceeding to the second step of the operation he feels the two borders of the groove with the nail of his left index-finger, and with certainty staff. cuts between them into the groove, he will he still sure of his guide into the bladder, and not likely to fall into the not uncommon error of mistaking the side of the staff for the groove and thus going astray. If, again, when running his knife down the director into the bladder, he pushes it sufficiently far as to feel all resistance cease, and for urine to flow, he may be certain that the bladder has been opened. And if, on introducing his finger into the bladder, “ he never pushes the point of his fore-finger onwards unless he feels certain that he has it between the staff and the wound,” he is not likely to make a cavity in the cellular tissue outside the bladder with his finger, or to push the Not to bladder off the end of the staff; and, if he never removes the director or ^Y'flrigers in staff till his finger or gorget has been introduced into the bladder as a bladder, guide to his forceps, he is still free from error. In the last step, he has only to handle his forceps boldly, to grasp the Extract stone full}', and, in extracting it, always to draw downivards and back- stone wards, and he will complete his operation without a mishap. an(j " The external wound should always be free, the internal limi- downwards. ■ ted; moderate dilatation of the neck of the bladder being free from harm.

Martineau was very fond of the hlunt gorget in most cases, and I am tempted to think, that in adult subjects it might now be used more frequently with advantage. I have found the greatest benefit from its use in several cases. When the prostatic enlargement encroaches on the bladder, the vesi- cal lobe may be lacerated by the blades of the forceps and torn away; and prostatic adenoid tumours may likewise be enucleated. Key noticed this in 1837; Fergusson brought the subject forward at the Patho- logical Society in 1848 ; Cadge exhibited two specimens in 1862 ; and in 1878 I reported two others. I removed one in the fork of my forceps, an inch in diameter, on January 19th, 1875, when operating for stone upon a man, set. 67, with a mulberry calculus one inch and a half in diameter, and the man made an excellent recovery. The second was from a patient, set. 70, who was operated upon in February, 1876; the prostatic tumour being enucleated during the extraction of a large stone with the forceps, and the recovery was complete. When the stone is soft, friable and comes away piecemeal, it is wise to wash the bladder well out with a stream of tepid water; and, at times, when the stone is apparently held by the bladder in such a position as forbids its being caught by the forceps, a stream of water through the bladder may dislodge it and allow of its removal. Very large stones should be crushed through the perineal wound before their removal, and a short strong lithotrite is the best instru- ment for that purpose. In moderately large stones, when the wound in the neck of the bladder is not large enough, Liston’s advice should be followed, and an incision made on the opposite side of the neck of the bladder by passing a blunt-pointed bistoury into the wound, guided by the finger, and turning its edge towards the right tuber ischii. Martineau says that he likewise often enlarged the inner wound two or three times, to facilitate the escape of the stone. When a second stone forms in the bladder, and another operation is demanded, there is no reason why it should not be performed in the same position and manner as the first, and with equal success. I have recently at intervals of three andfifteenmonths had to cut a patient, set. 60, three times for stone, removing on tbe first occasion seven calculi, on the second two, and on the third two, with good results. The stones averaged on each occasion more than an inch in diameter. The patient did as well after the second and third opera- tions as after the first, and is now quite well. The Norwich statistics, as compiled by Mr. C. Williams, show that a third operation may be performed with like success. (‘Lancet’, May 18th, 1878). Lateral lithotomy has hitherto been described, and, without doubt, as a general operation is the best; nevertheless, other operations have been suggested and adopted. Among these the so-called median operation demands notice. It is the old Italian or Marian method, based upon the precept “ a small incision, much dilatation,” and has been revived by Allarton. It is performed as follows :—The operator first introduces an ordinary grooved staff into the bladder, and gives it to an assistant. He then passes his left forefinger into the rectum, with the palmar sur-LITHOTOMY. 119 face upwards as far as tlie apex of the prostate, and holds it there, as a guide to the next step of the operation. He then takes a long straight bistoury, and, with its edge upwards, introduces it about half an inch in front of the anus in the median line, down to the membranous por- tion of the urethra or apex of the prostate, into the groove of the staff, and presses it towards the bladder for about half an inch. He then cuts upwards, dividing the membranous portion of the urethra freely, and the soft parts of the peril)tcum, making an external wound about an inch and a half long. Through this wound he next introduces a long ball- pointed probe along the groove of the staff into the bladder, then withdrawing the staff. Upon this probe the finger is passed into the bladder with a rotatory movement, the prostatic portion of the urethra and neck of the bladder being dilated, the forceps are then inserted into the bladder and the stone removed. Where the stone is large, Allarton employs Weiss’s three-bladed female dilator, or Arnott’s hydraulic dilator. Upon the whole, however, modern experience does not give much Remarks on support to the operation. It may be done with safety when the j|><- stone is small; but when large, there must of necessity be too much „perat,,on. laceration of the neck of the bladder and prostate to render the opera- tion equal to the lateral. In children, the dilating process is dangerous, and apt to be at- tended by a tearing away of the neck of the bladder from its perineal attachment. In adult patients where lithotrity is inapplicable and the stone not large, it may be employed, particularly when any loss of blood is to be guarded against; for it is probably the case that there is less loss of blood in adults by this operation than in lateral lithotomy; although in children, there is no difference between the two operations in this respect. The experience of Guy’s surgeons is certainly not favourable to the operation, and that of Norwich in no way tends to give it any support, the mortality of the median being nearly twice as great as the lateral operation ; indeed it may be stated, that as an operation, it is losing ground. Dolbeau’s operation must be mentioned as a modification of the Dolbeau’s median. A full description of it can be found in his work on ‘ La Litho- operation, tritie Perineale,’ 1872. In its first step where the membranous portion of the urethra is opened, it differs in no important respect from Allar- ton’s, but in the second, the neck of the bladder and parts external to it are dilated, while in the third, unless the stone be very small, it is broken before removal. The dilating process, an essential part of the operation, is effected by means of a very ingenious six-bladed dilator, the blades of which are so arranged as to separate without diverging, by means of two balls which move upon a central stem. The external parts down to the urethra are dilated first, then the membranous portion of the urethra, and lastly, the neck of the bladder; the passage into the bladder by these successive dilatations being of uniform calibre and with smooth walls. The stone is broken,°not crushed, by the “ cassepi&rre,” an instrumeut that opens in the bladder without divergence of its limbs. The fragments should then be removed with care and the bladder washed out.LITHOTOMY. 120 Bilateral section of the prostate. Civinle’s operation. Buchanan’s operation. Mode of performance. Recto-vesical operation. Dolbeau claims for this operation great advantages, which are not yet proved. The instruments, however, are very ingenious. Dupuytren’s bilateral section of the prostate for the removal of large stones, with the semilunar transverse perineal incision in front of the anus, meets with few supporters at the present day. He made his first incision with a scalpel down to the membranous portion of the urethra, and afterwards introduced into the groove of the staff a double-bladed curved lithotome which was pushed, closed down to the stone into the bladder along the staff. The blades were then opened transversely, and the instrument withdrawn. By these means the neck of the bladder and prostate were freely incised, the prostatic section having an oblique direction downwards. Civiale in 1836, suggested his medio-bilateral operation, “ being dis- satisfied with the bilateral, and shunning the lateral method on account of the anatomical objections.” Having introduced a staff with a me- dian groove, he made an incision in the median line an inch and a half long in front of the anus down to the membranous portion of the urethra. He made also a free opening into the urethra, and then introduced an instrument similar to Dupuytren’s lithotome,butstraight, along the groove of the staff into the bladder, opening the blades when the bladder had been entered, and dividing the neck of the bladder on its withdrawal. The finger was then introduced, staff removed, and for- ceps inserted, the stone being removed as in other operations. It differs little from Dupuytren’s, except in the form of perineal incision. Sir H. Thompson, who first described this operation in England, as well as Erichsen, have both successfully removed calculi by this operation. Dr. Andrew Buchanan’s operation with the rectangular staff, bent three inches from the point, and deeply grooved laterally with a posterior opening, is essentially a central operation. He suggested it in 1847. The staff is introduced into the bladder, and, guided by the finger in the rectum, the angle of the staff is made to correspond to the apex of the prostate. The operator, still retaining his finger in the rectum, inserts a long straight bistoury in front of the anus, with the blade horizontal and edge turning to the left down to the groove and angle of the staff, and pushing it towards the bladder to stop at the end of the staff. He then withdraws the knife, and as he does so, makes a curved incision through the soft parts around the left side of the rectum towards the tuber ischii, the wound being about an inch and a half long. Dr. Buchanan describes his operation as being half that of Dupuytren’s. When the stone is large, the right side of the prostate is cut, thus approaching it more nearly as a whole. The recto-vesical operation was at one time a very favourite one. The late Mr. Lloyd, of St. Bartholomew’s, was about the last English surgeon who freely practised it, whereas nowr it has been almost lost sight of. The operation consists in the introduction of the knife into the rectum, with the blade flat upon the palmar surface of the right index- finger, the turning of the edge of the knife upwards, and the perfora- tion of the bowel and urethra at the apex of the prostate down to the groove of the staff; the sphincter and soft parts being freely divided upwards in the median line of the pei'inaeum for about one inch on the withdrawal of the knife. The left forefinger is next inserted into the wound down to the groove of the staff, and the bistoury a<uiin introducod with its edge downwards and pushed into the bladder121 LITHOTOMY. along the groove, the neck of the bladder and prostate being freely divided when the stone is large. The finger is then passed into the bladder along the staff, the staff removed and forceps passed, the cal- culus being extracted in the usual way. As an ordinary operation, this is greatly inferior to the lateral. Konig’s statistics, as quoted by Poland, show it to be very unsuccessful. When the stone is very large, it may, however, be entertained. The high operation, or supra-pubic, is one of the oldest, and was Supra-pubic practised by Cheselden and Civiale. It was at one time supposed to operation, be the most direct and least dangerous operation, the only dangerous part involved in it being the peritoneum, which can readily be avoided. For large stones it may be entertained. The operation consists of three stages :— The first consists in exposing the anterior wall of the bladder by a Mode of vertical incision made in the median line above the pubes through performance, the parietes, with the patient on his back, his pelvis raised and bladder moderately distended with a 1 per cent, solution of carbolic acid or thymol of the temperature of the body. The second step is that of opening the bladder, and care should be observed that this opening is made in the median line and close to the symphysis. This is best done by transfixing the bladder where it is exposed, and opening it from below upwards, care being also observed that the wound in the abdominal parietes is carefully kept open with retractors. The third step is the removal of the stone by means of forceps. After the operation, the wound in the bladder should be brought together carefully with sutures, and the external wound closed above, a space being left below for drainage, and the case left to nature. The nriue should subsequently be drawn off at short intervals. The statistics of the operation are not quite satisfactory. Gross gives one death in four cases; Civiale, one in two; Humphry, of Cambridge, and Dulles, one in three. The latter author speaks highly of it (‘American Journal of Med. Science,’ July, 1875; April, 1878). He believes the operation to be deserving of more attention, and should receive a fairer trial than it has yet had. All these varieties of operations have been detailed, as exceptional cases of stone may be met with in which one or the other may be better than the lateral, but as a general operation, lateral lithotomy is the best, and of the modes of performing this operation, Key’s is the simplest and most successful. Causes of death after lithotomy. When patients die unrelieved with calculus, they generally do so from Causes of kidney disease, and in the majority of fatal cases of lithotomy, the death after same cause produces a like result. When kidney disease is not present lithot°m)’- any of the operations described for the removal of the stone, when per- formed with average skill, is likely to be successful. When kidney disease exists, any operation is likely to prove unsuccessful. These facts are fully illustrated in a paper I read in 1862 (Med. and Chir. Society) on the causes of death after lithotomy. The longer a stone remains in the bladder tbe greater are the proba- Prognosis, bihties of renal disease, and, consequently, the larger the stone the greater the risk.122 STONE IN THE FEMALE BLADDER. Hemorrhage Pelvic cellulitis and peritonitis. Acute cystitis. Uremia. Calculus in the female bladder. Symptoms. The duration of the symptoms and the size of the stone are conse- quently valuable aids in forming a prognosis. When death takes place from so-called shock, it is probably connected with organic renal disease. In a small proportion of cases, death takes place from haemorrhage ; such a result, however, when uncomplicated, being very exceptional. It does not probably occur once in a hundred cases. Pelvic cellulitis and peritonitis have usually been regarded as common causes of death. Pelvic cellulitis is very insidious, and often only positively made known when some peritoneal complications make their appearance. Its cause has generally been assigned to a too extensive incision of the neck of the bladder, but the careful investigation of a large number of fatal cases suggests the probability, that although a fatal complication, it is one which for the most part arises without uriuary infiltration and as a result of continuity with structures that have become inflamed from injury sustained during the operation, or, from the prolonged presence of the stone. It is also commonly associated with renal disease, and it is now well known, that under such circumstances, the inflammation of serous membranes is very com- mon. It is consequently an open question as to how far the renal disease or the operation is the cause of the pelvic cellulitis and peritonitis. Death from acute cystitis may occur, as it may from the hsemorrhagic diathesis, pyaemia, chloroform, or any accident. Uraemia, as a cause of death, is classed with renal disease. In children, incontinence of urine is apt to follow the operation, par- ticularly when the horizontal position has not been rigidly enforced during the healing process. It is, however, a rare effect. Wasting of a testis may likewise take place from some disease or wound of the vas deferens. I have, however, known this to occur but once. Cases of it have, however, been recorded by Teevan and others. STONE IN THE FEMALE BLADDER. Calculi are doubtless formed as frequent in the kidney of the female as in that of the male, and pass downwards into the bladder, although from the absence of the prostate as well as the shortness and dilatability of the female urethra, they rarely require surgical treat- ment. The records of surgery contain many instances in which large calculi have been passed by natural efforts from the female bladder without any very injurious effect resulting, and Mr. Clogg, of Looe, Cornwall, has recorded a case, in which a stone nearly four inches round was thus passed (‘ Brit. Med. Jour.,’ May 2,1874). But the experience of every surgeon will supply him with instances in which calculi of moderate dimensions have been readily passed, and I have a specimen of mul- berry stone, nearly an inch in diameter, which a young woman thus got rid of. In neglected cases of vesical calculi in women the stone may, however, excite ulceration of the bladder, or be discharged per vaginam. The symptoms of stone in the bladder of the female are very similar123 STONE IN THE BLADDER. to those in the male, such as irritability of bladder, pain during and after the act of micturition, intermittent flow of urine, and hsematuria, a bearing-down pain and incontinence of urine being common accom- paniments. In the female sex, uterine and vesical symptoms are so closely associated, that surgeons cannot be too much aware of the fact, since cases of stone in the bladder are frequently passed over as examples of uterine disease, when a vaginal examination would reveal the true state of affairs; a calculus can often be felt by the finger through the the vesico-vaginal septum, but where doubt exists, the sound will settle the point. The treatment of stone in women is far less complicated than in Treatment, men, on account of the anatomical formation of the parts, and the majority of calculi can be readily removed either by urethral dilatation and extraction or by lithotrity. The method by urethral dilatation is based on the natural one of By urethral expulsion, and is applicable in all cases of small calculi. In children, a stone three quarters of an inch in diameter, and in adults one inch, with the patient under the influence of chloroform may be fear- lessly removed from the bladder by rapid urethral dilatation and ex- traction. Indeed, 1 have removed calculi two inches in diameter by this means, without any injurious after-effect, but it is probably wise, not to make the attempt, the surgeon possessing in lithotrity an efficient aid or substitute. Slow dilatation of the urethra is almost certain to be followed by Rapid incontinence, while after rapid proceedings, it is rare to meet with this dilatation result. preferred. The operation may be performed as follows:—With the patient on Mode of her back under the influence of chloroform, Weiss’s three-pronged performance, dilator should be introduced and rapidly expanded sufficiently far to admit first the left index-finger of the operator, and then the forceps, when the stone, having been seized, can be rapidly removed. I have on several occasions employed the lithotrite for this purpose with the view of crushing the stone should any difficulties be experienced in its extraction, and therefore recommend the practice. On four occa- sions I have not dilated the urethra at all, but passed the lithotrite or forceps and extracted at once, and consider this plan is as good as any other, for every surgeon must be struck with the facility with which a finger or any moderate instrument can be introduced into the female bladder when the subject is under the influence of an anaesthetic. If any difficulty is felt in the extraction of the stone, or it prove larger than can be safely removed as a whole, it may be broken up and removed piecemeal. By these means I took away at one operation without any difficulty or bad result from a child only four years old, a calculus an inch and a half in diameter, and in the year 1869, I successfully removed with facility three calculi from three patients by these means. In female subjects there can be no such hesitation as to the wisdom of removing fragments after the crushing operation as there is in males. When the stone is too large for removal by rapid dilatation, or the bladder too contracted, inflamed, and ulcerated to allow of lithotrity, the very'iar°e'e stone should be removed per vaginam, the surgeon in this operation p again imitating a method sometimes resorted to by nature. To do this, ^';moval pcr124 FOREIGN BODIES IN THE BLADDER. Example. Summary of treatment. Foreign bodies in bladder in male and female. Example. a clean incision of sufficient length to admit the removal of the calculus has to be made into the bladder through the vaginal septum, guided by a director introduced through the urethra. The wound should subsequently be closed by means of stitches, as in vesico-vaginal fistula. I have removed, in this way, a stone two inches long, that formed a complete cast of the contracted bladder with good success. (Pig. 354.) Dr. Aveling and M. Vidal stronglyrecommend this operation, while Marion Sims thinks so well of it as to assert, “ that it is the only j ustifiable operation for stone in the female bladder,’’ and if by the word operation he means a cutting one he is certainly right, for where the urethra has been divided to allow of the removal of stone, incontin- ence is a common consequence. Urethral lithotomy is here mentioned only to be condemned, as any incision into the neck of the female bladder is liable, as has just been said, to be followed by incontinence of urine, half of the cases, as a rule, being so affected. By way of summary, therefore, it may be concluded :— That a stone of moderate size may readily be removed from the female bladder by immediate extraction, and one of larger dimensions by lithotrity and extraction, the patient being fully under the influence of an anaesthetic. That where from the size of the stone, immediate extraction is not advisable, or, from the condition of the bladder litho- trity cannot be performed, vaginal lithotomy is the best operation, while all slow dilatation of the urethra is to be avoided, and all urethral lithotomy condemned on account of the frequency of incontinence of urine as the result of such treatment. For further information and statistics, vide Dr. Aveling, ‘ Obst. Trans.,’ 1864; and paper by author, ‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1864. Foreign Bodies in the Bladder. These are occasionally met with both in the male and female subject. Broken catheters and bougies are probably the most common; but a tobacco pipe, pins, French chalk, slate-pencil, straw, a silver toothpick, penholder, &c., are in the Guy’s Museum recorded as foreign bodies that have been removed from the male bladder, and a bone bodkin-case, a cedar-pencil, and a stiletto from the female. Foreign bodies may, however, obtain access to the bladder through wounds, gunshot or otherwise, or through abscesses connected with bone. Brodie has related a case in which he removed a calculus from a young lady which contained “ a small portion of bone, and two im- perfectly formed human teeth,” doubtless the remains of a blighted ovum; and a second, in which a stone from the female bladder had a hazel nut as a nucleus. When a foreign body remains long in the bladder, it acts as an irritant, and usually becomes rapidly covered with phosphates, as Fig. 354, Calculus, Hal f natural size, removed from the female bladder through the vagina.125 FOREIGN BODIES IN THE BLADDER. has been already stated. In a specimen at the College of Surgeons a foreign body is the nucleus of a uric acid calculus. As soon as a foreign body is known to exist it ought to be removed.

I had a case some years ago in which a long hair-pin had been im- pacted in the penis and perinaeum with its points forwards, one end being felt at the base of the penis embedded in the tissues beneath the skin. Under chloroform, I pressed the point through the skin and gradually withdrew the pin, which came out nearly straight. A rapid recovery followed, without a bad symptom.

I was fortunate enough to catch it at its bulbous end and to with- draw it without much difficulty, a rapid recovery following.

Organic Generally chronic. A diminution in the calibre of the urethra, the result of organic changes within its walls, gives rise to stricture; any encroachment on the passage from without or within causes obstruction. Obstruction occurs when the urethra is narrowed from inflammatory engorgement of its mucous and submucous tissue (the inflammatory stricture of some authors), or from spasm of the urethral muscle's (spasmodic stricture) ; when an abscess or tumour outside the urethra, or any prostatic enlargement encroaches on the urethra, or any frac- ture of the pelvis presses upon it; and lastly, when a calculus or foreign body is impacted in the passage, or a urethral polypus blocks it up. Organic stricture is caused by the contraction of inflammatory de- stricture, and posit situated upon, within, or beneath the mucous membrane of the its causes. canal, or from the contraction of the cicatrix of a ruptured or injured urethra. The first form may be described as simple organic stricture. The second as traumatic or cicatricial stricture. The former is the more common, my notes showing 603 examples of the former to 43 of the latter in consecutive cases, or in the proportion of fourteen to one. In the majority of cases the contraction of an organic stricture is of a chronic nature, and in some may be readily traced to a more or less distinct chronic inflammation of the passage; but years will fre- quently pass before the obstruction to the flow of urine becomes of sufficient importance to arrest attention, and a sudden attack of retention of urine, induced by some act of irregularity or exposure to cold, will probably be the first symptom to draw the patient’s attention to his condition. The stricture may consist simply of a perforated membranous diaphragm stretched across the canal, of a narrow hand of inflam- matory product surrounding the passage, to which the terms “ whip- cord,” “ ring,” or “ annular” stricture is attached, and in rarer cases to bands of lymph stretching across the passage, and forming what are known as “ bridle strictures.” It may be general or partial, and when the latter, may have been caused either by some adhesion of the natural rugae of the urethra, or of some folds of its mucous lining. When the stricture is more extensive, there is hardly a limit to the extent of inflammatory deposit which may exist, from the narrow band already alluded to as forming the “annular” stricture, passing onwards to the broader hand which answers to Sir A. Cooper’s term of “ ribbon” stricture, to the still severer cases in which the urethra is found more or less contracted throughout its entire course. Between these ex- tremes, numberless varieties and degrees of mischief may be observed, the urethra presenting one single contraction, or several indepen- dent ones. John Hunter mentioned a case in which six strictures coexisted. Lastly, the urethra may unquestionably become “impermeable,” the pathological specimens in Guy’s Museum being sufficient to demonstrate the fact. Such a condition, however, cannot exist uncomplicated with other symptoms, since it is obvious that the mine must have some Varieties of stricture.

An obliteration of the urethra, the result of injury i.e. trau- matic stricture, is also met with. Locality of stricture. Locality of For the only definite facts relating to this subject I must refer stricture, and I do so with pleasure to the labours of Sir H. Thompson; for although other writers have given their “ impressions upon the. sub- ject and published isolated cases, it is to him that the profession is indebted for the analysis of 270 preparations contained in the various museums, by which inquiry alone this question could have been satis- factorily determined. He has most satisfactorily proved what is now generally received as true, that in by far the majority of cases of stricture, the juncture of the spongy and membranous portions of the urethra is its most frequent seat (Fig. 357), and that the inch situated Fig. 357. Stricture of the urethra, with dilatation of urethra behind stricture and hypertrophy of bladder. in front of this spot is the next position in point of frequency, while exceptional cases may be found in the prostatic end of the membranous portion, at the external orifice, or at the terminal two inches of the urethra, but no specimen existed in which a stricture has been observed in the prostatic portion. Looking over my own cases with a view to inquiring into the Statistics of causes of stricture, I find, omitting congenital narrowing of the ure- causes- thra, that chronic gonorrhoeal inflammation had existed in 273 out of the 646 instances, and that in 78 of these, injections had been employed in its cure; that direct injury was the assigned cause of 43; while • in 330 no definite cause could be obtained. With these facts it Gonorrlm-a seems, therefore, right to conclude “ That although gonorrhoea often as a cause, precedes a stricture, at least half the cases are found in subjects who have not suffered from such a disease; and that when gonorrhoea might be assigned as a cause, the use of injections for its cure does not appear to have had any positively injurious influence in producing a stricture.” I may add, that these results can be strictly relied on, as, when noting the cases, considerable care was taken to senrch out this fact. It may therefore unquestionably be asserted, that injections have not the inju- Injections as rious influence in exciting stricture which some authors have ascribed a cause- to them. Among the 330 cases in which no positive cause could be assigned, were three in which “gout” existed; and several in which the^con- traction of chancres might fairly be ascribed as the cause of the obstruction.STRICTURE OP THE URETHRA. 128 l’liosphatic diathesis as cause. Symptoms of stricture. Retention. Altered stream. Retention may be due to spasm of muscles. Frequency o retention in organic stricture. Irritable bladder. Rectum affected. Urine altered. I have been unable to discover that tbe so-called pbosphatic dia- thesis has any influence in exciting the formation of an organic stric- ture, or any other urethral disease, although this is a point upon which Sir B. Brodie has largely dwelt; but there can be no doubt, that any morbid condition of the urine has considerable power in exciting a spasmodic contraction of the muscular walls of the urethra more par- ticularly when an organic stricture exists, and of inducing retention of the urine. Symptoms.—In a large proportion of the cases of simple organic stricture, an attack of retention of urine is the first thing which attracts the attention of the patient, which may have followed some indiscretion in diet, excess of drinking, or exposure to cold. It is then, perhaps, for the first time, that the patient can bring to his recollection the fact, that other less marked but not less certain symptoms, had existed previously for some time. It may be that a chronic gleet had been present for many months, or that some urethral pain or difficulty had attended the act of micturition, that the stream of urine had been somewhat narrowed, divided, twisted, or of a screw shape; or that micturition had been more frequent or prolonged; yet these symptoms by themselves had failed to make sufficient impression upon the mind of the sufferer as to lead him to suspect the existence of a stricture. It must not be thought, however, that the retention is usually caused by the gradual contraction of the stricture, though in excep- tional cases such a condition may exist, yet it is tolerably certain that in the majority, the retention is due to some spasmodic action of the urethral muscles at the seat of stricture, for very slight causes appear capable of exciting spasmodic action of the canal in a diseased urethra, and consequently giving rise to retention; spasmodic and organic stricture being generally combined. Indeed out of 483 cases of stricture consecutively admitted into Guy’s, 129, or more than a fourth, were suffering from retention. When the stricture is not discovered under these circumstances, it will, if not detected early, soon give rise to other and more characteristic symptoms. The stream of urine will gradually contract so that it will at last cease to exist, the urine passing only in drops. The bladder will become so irritable that the patient will have to rise frequently in the night to micturate, and the effort will be attended with pain; a small quantity of urine, moreover, will probably also be passed; symptoms affecting the rectum will soon appear, and the straining during the act of micturition will be associated with tenesmus; these symptoms at times being so severe as to necessitate, whenever natural relief is sought, the use of the stool instead of the chamber vessel. Prolapsus recti, or piles, also frequently complicate the case; while incontinence of urine may follow. Under these circumstances, it is clear, that the bladder is never emptied, although some small quantity of urine may be passed at each act of micturition. The retained urine, undergoing partial decom- position, acts as an irritant, and becomes cloudy and ammoniacal, depositing more or less mucus and phosphates. The urine collecting, gives rise to distension of the bladder, which, pressing on the rectum, excites tenesmus and prolapsus, and, interfering with the return of the venous blood, to piles. As the distension increases, the bladder loses its power of contraction, and consequently expands till it overflows—the129 STRICTURE OP THE URETHRA. overfioic of urine giving rise to incontinence which is a direct result of Incontinence, chronic retention. A physical examination of the abdomen of a patient under these circumstances will reveal the distended viscus as a central globular swelling, giving a dull sound on percussion. During these changes, others no less important are going on at the Conditions seat of stricture; the urethra behind the stricture dilates—this dilatation gten'*"^rc being mechanical and the direct result of the ineffectual efforts of the bladder to overcome the obstruction (Fig. 357). As the pressure con- tinues, inflammation of the urethra and parts around appears, the tissues as they expand become indurated, and after a time, ulcerate from the continued irritation. A few drops of urine then percolate into the cel- Abscess, lular tissue behind the stricture, and, setting up suppuration, form a urinary abscess, which to the finger will appear as a deep-seated perineal swelling. Where the abscess is slow in its formation, it will be indolent and Fistula. painless, but if rapid, very painful, and when opened or left to natural processes it will almost to a certainty be followed by a perineal urinary fistula. If, however, the abscess and the urethral stricture be left unrelieved, and the bladder with the abdominal muscles still continue to act and ineffectually to overcome the urethral obstruction, the urine by being forced into the dilated urethra behind the stricture and into the perineal abscess communicating with it, will sooner or later, unless the stricture be relieved, cause rupture of the abscess into the cellular tissue of the parts around, and as a result give rise to extravasation Extravasa- of urine. tion- If this giving way of the parts appears during the efforts of the patient to overcome the stricture, or the spasmodic action of the bladder and abdominal muscles, a sudden relief from the previous agony and the sensation that something has given way may for a time lull the apprehensions of the patient, and mislead him into the idea that all is well, hut the swelling of the perineum, scrotum, penis, and supra-pubic region, which must soon follow, with the absence of any flow of urine through the natural channel, will reveal to the professional eye the true nature of the accident, and prove that the urethra has given wny behind the stricture, and extravasation of urine has taken place. Instruments for the Detection of a Stricture. For the detection of a stricture as well as for its dilatation, metallic Catheters catheters, elastic catheters or filiform bougies may be employed. stricture*1 °r The metallic catheter I prefer is that figured 342-3. The curve " Ure' being short, the end bulbous and a size larger than the shank, this form of catheters is very perfect for mere examination purposes. The elastic instruments are upon the French model and are made of the same material throughout, a groove in the top answering as a substi- tute for the ivory head which is never known to keep its place, and when a catheter has to be fastened into the bladder, the benefit of this arrangement is at once proved. These catheters are made verv small (Fig. 358), even to the half size. For dilating a stricture they should always be preferred. The filiform bougies are made of the same material as the elastic catheter or of catgut or whalebone. I prefer the first and last, ns they are made very fine and smooth, with or without olive tips; some are VOL. II. y130 STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. General symptoms. Rigors.

They can often be insinuated through a narrow stricture when a catheter cannot be introduced, and are consequently of great value for dilating purposes. As guides into the bladder they are also of equal use, and particularly for internal or external urethrotomy. When these small bougies are used the urethra should be previously filled with oil. Fig. 358. During the development of a stricture, and more particularly when the stricture has become a real cause of obstruction, a patient’s general condition is rarely good, and what are generally known as dyspeptic symptoms commonly exist; as a consequence, the patient often loses flesh, looks careworn and ill, the digestive organs failing to do their duty as in health. As the disease progresses, a constant feeling of chilliness is very common, and rigors are not unusual; these symptoms being at times intermittent, and are often regarded as being due to “ ague.” Whilst a perineal abscess is forming, they are commonly present. When they are uncomplicated, however, with such a local cause and are still frequent, there is good reason to believe that they indicate some renal complication; for it cannot be too strongly impressed upon the surgeon’s mind, that no strictnre can long exist without producing secondarily important changes in the bladder and kidneys. Results of Stricture. When a stricture is neglected, renal disease is certain to follow, and when death takes place as a consequence of stricture, it will be from kidney disease if it has not been suddenly brought about by one of the complications of stricture, such as retention or extravasation of urine. Thus, out of 100 deaths from stricture analysed by Dr. Goodhart (‘Guy’s Rep.,’ vol. xix, series iii), which took place at Guy’s Hospital, in nineteen years the kidneys were suppurating in 41; wasted or inflamed in 18; diseased in a less degree or cystic in 7 ; and healthy in 34, or about one third. Organic strictures are not, however, all of the same character. The simple stricture is the most usual, and beyond the mechanical effects of its existence has no special feature. The irritable stricture is comparatively rare, and is characterised by excessive sensibility on being touched by a catheter, with a disposition to bleed. It is also prone to be associated with chilliness and even rigors. The contractile stricture may belong to either of the two former groups; its pecu- liarity consisting in its tendency to recontract after its dilatation. The cicatricial or traumatic stricture has characters of its owrn, and of these, its obstinacy is the most marked. It is important to bear these divisions of organic stricture constantly in mind, for the successful treatment of a case will often turn upon them recognition.131 STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. Treatment.—Before a surgeon can say with certainty that a Treatment of stricture exists, a urethral examination is a necessity, and this is an 8tncture- operation in which as many difficulties are met with by the inexpe- rienced as in those far more complicated; indeed, without some skill and confidence, the attempt to pass a full-sized catheter down a healthy urethra constantly fails. To pass a catheter, it is usually wise to place the patient in the Mode ot recumbent position, with the shoulders slightly raised and the knees separated, the surgeon observing that he is lying quite straight, with the abdomen exposed to the navel, this point being the best guide to the line of the urethra. A large metallic instrument (No. 7 or 8 being the best) should be selected for the examination, and made moderately warm by being dipped in warm water or rubbed by the hand and tho- roughly well oiled. The operator should stand on the left side of the patient, and raising the penis with his left hand introduce the end of the catheter into its urethral orifice, keeping its point during the intro- Position of duction of the first three or four inches well to the lower surface of auroc0u- the urethra, in order to avoid the lacunm of the urethra that exist in the roof of the passage. The handle of the instrument at this step of the operation, may be directed over the left thigh of the patient, I or, what is preferable, maintained over the median line of the body in the direction of the umbilicus. With the left hand he may then gently draw the penis up the instrument which he with the right Manipulation allows by its own weight to slip down the passage, simply directing it with a light hand. When its end has reached the bulbous portion of the urethra the handle of the catheter must then be gently depressed in the central line of the body, and if no obstruction exists, the bladder will he entered; the point of the instrument during this movement being kept well along the upper surface of the urethra. In a healthy urethra, indeed, the surgeon has little more than to guide a metallic instrument into the bladder, the weight of the catheter being alone nearly sufficient to allow it to pass down the passage. Half the errors committed in catheterism arise from a non-appreciation of this fact; the desire to pass the catheter originating efforts that inter- fere with the entry of the instrument into the bladder under proper guidance. When a stricture exists the catheter will be arrested in its course; where and, under these circumstances, it should be withdrawn an inch or so stricture and passed on again, with the handle slightly altered in direction. If exia,s- the resistance is still felt the instrument should be withdrawn and one of a smaller size employed, and on this failing to glide by the obstruc- tion a yet smaller one, and so on till the stricture is entered. The seat of stricture or strictures, as well as the nature of the con- traction, will be made out by this process. If much pain attend the examination the surgeon has employed either too much force or an irri- table stricture exists, and if bleeding follows, this latter probability is strengthened, particularly if no violence has been employed. Catheter- Avoid force, ism, indeed, ought never to be attended with violence, and if gentle measures do not succeed, no other should be attempted. In passing a catheter, some prefer the patient to be in the erect Catheterism position, but I cannot recommend it; there is more chance of inflict- in erect ing injury in this position by the patient moving, and the surgeon has Position- not so complete a control over his instrument or patient as when he isSTRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. 132 recumbent. When there is a stricture the erect position is certainly wrong. The mode known as the “tour de maitre” has only to be named to be condemned; though in the hands of a skilled surgeon it may be done with impunity. The plan consists in introducing the catheter with the handle presenting downwards and the convexity of its curve upwards, passing it along the urethra down to the bulb, and then, onwards into the bladder, by describing a half circle towards the umbilicus, the handle of the instrumentwhen it has reached the median line of the body above being gradually depressed, and the end of the instrument in this turn made to enter the bladder. Treatment of Stricture. Pathology of stricture. Principles of treatment. Continuous or inter- mittent dilatation. Mode of carrying out continuous. The treatment of stricture must be based on the pathology of the disease; and mild means should always be preferred to forcible or cutting measures. The pathology of stricture is simple, and consists either in the deposition of inflammatory products in the mucous and submucous tissue with their subsequent contraction; or, in the contraction of a cicatrix, the result of an injury. The principle of treatment is also simple, for it is, 'primarily, to dilate the contracted canal, and secondarily, to obtain the absorp- tion or breaking-up of the effused inflammatory products. The more simple the means by which these ends can be secured the better. Where the first end has been obtained without the second, temporary benefit may have been effected, but no more. Where both ends can be gained by simple means, the treatment must be pronounced good. In ordinary cases of organic stricture, there is little doubt that these ends are to be secured by dilatation of the stricture ; and that by such local treatment alone, the majority of cases of organic stricture may be successfully overcome. Now, this treatment by dilatation may be continuous or intermittent. The former method is to be preferred, and should be carried out as follows; it is certainly tbe most rapid and effectual tbe surgeon has at his disposal, although it necessitates about a fortnight’s rest. The size of the stricture having been gauged, an elastic conical catheter with a bulbous end is to be taken and well oiled, and as large a one as can be passed through the stricture introduced. Should the English catheter be preferred, it ought to be made soft and flexible by being dipped in warm water or by friction with the finger, and used without the stylet. The penis of the recumbent patient must then be raised by the left hand and drawn forward as well as slightly down- ward, so as to make the urethra as straight as possible. The catheter should then be introduced, and passed gently down the passage. If obstruction be felt, the catheter may be slightly withdrawn and then pressed forwards, the largest instrument the stricture will admit with- out force being introduced, which having passed the stricture and entered the bladder, is to be fastened in (Fig. 359), the end of the catheter up to its eye alone resting in the bladder. The orifice of the catheter may either be plugged with a peg of wood or the end capped by a piece of india-rubber tubing, the free endSTRICTURE OF THE URETHRA.. 133 being dropped into a urinal, or tied in a knot to prevent escape of urine. After twenty-four hours if the catheter moves freely in the stric- ture it may be removed and a larger size introduced, the surgeon being careful not to be tempted to introduce one that fits the stricture too firmly. On the third and following days, the same practice may be followed, and in about ten days a complete dilatation of the stricture will probably have been perfected. If the catheter does not move freely in the stricture, it must be left a few hours longer. When the presence of the instrument in the bladder causes irritation, which is not remedied by such alkalies as the citrate or tartrate of potash with buchu and hyoscyamus, it is wise to have the catheter removed some few hours before a larger size is introduced ,• thereby giving the bladder rest. When it is impossible for the patient to maintain rest, a catheter may be passed in the evening, retained all night, and removed in the morning. At other times where the symptoms are more severe, some slight intermission of the treat- ment may be advisable, the passage of the catheter alone being practised. After the stricture has been fully dilated, the daily passage of an instrument for a few days subsequently is all that is required, the interval between the introduction of the catheter being gradually lengthened. The patient need not always be confined to bed during this treat- ment; but lie on a sofa or sit quietly in a reclining chair. When movement, however, causes irritation of the bladder, it must be forbidden. In severe and neglected strictures this plan is one that ought always to be followed when possible, as it is sound in its principle, safe in its practice, and as expeditious as is consistent with the object ; aimed at. The intermittent form of dilatation is required in less severe cases, or where rest cannot be obtained; and can be carried out by the intro- duction of an instrument on one day, and after the lapse of one or two more, its re-introduction, followed by the employment of a larger size, and so on, till complete dilatation of the stricture has been effected. It is the second best plan the surgeon has at his command, and although more tedious than the former, in the end successful; patients so treated, however, require doubtless the more frequent introduction of a catheter to maintain the urethra in its dilated condition than others treated by the former plan. For this method of treatment metallic in- struments are better than elastic. When a stricture is so contracted that a catheter cannot be passed i even alter very careful manipulation, the attempt should be given up ! and alkalies given. When the urethra is irritable, opium, enforced • rest, and the hip bath are of use; and after the lapse of a day or more, i success may follow another attempt. When the stricture is reached' by the catheter, gentle pressure upon it may be employed; indeed, Fig. 359. Mode of fastening catheter in the bladder.

Dilatation performed. pressure may be kept up for two or three minutes, the parts often yielding under its influence and allowing the instrument to pass. If this end be obtained, let the surgeon be satisfied and leave the catheter in, whether silver or elastic, for should he remove it, he will in all probability fail to pass a second. If the instrument be silver, an elastic one should be substituted when it is removed. When a catheter is grasped and “ held ” in the urethra, the operator may be tolerably sure that he has entered the stricture, and if the end be moveable he may be equally sure that he is in a false passage. When the catheter has been held and passed forwards into the bladder, all is well, when it slips suddenly into a moveable space, the urethra has probably been perforated. Under these circumstances, when a false passage probably exists, it is wise to give up local treatment for a few days to allow the parts to heal. A stricture should be dilated up to its fullest extent. It is important to bear in mind, that after the full dilatation of a stricture, contraction will again talce place after a time, if the passage be not kept open; but the introduction of a catheter once in every two, three, four, or more months according to circumstances, is generally sufficient to prevent such a result taking place. What in modern language is called “the rapid or immediate treatment of stricture” is in reality its ruptui'e or splitting—it being in all probability a rare thing for a stricture to be suddenly, fully, and rapidly dilated without being lacerated. The plan known by this name has cei'tainly a taking title, and in practice, has apparent advantages which, if supported by experience, woixld establish its claims on the attention of surgeons. In our day, it is known as that of Holt, but Holt’s instruments are mere modifications of M. Perreve’s made in 1847, and the same sort of practice has been adopted by Mr. T. Wakley, Dr. Hutton, of Dublin, Maisonneuve, Buchanan, and others. Holt describes his instrument “as consisting of two grooved blades, fixed in a divided handle, and containing between them a wire welded to their points, and on this wire a tube (which when introduced between the blades corresponds to the natural calibre of the urethra) is quickly passed, and thus ruptux-es or splits the obstruction.” The stricture having been split, the dilator should be rotated to separate further the sides of the rent, and then withdrawn; a catheter corresponding to the number of the tube being substituted for the purpose of removing the urine. This method, however, no more effects a permanent cure of a stricture than the plan of dilatation already referred to, since every hospital surgeon has been called upon to treat cases of stricture that had been subjected to the plan and then relapsed. Indeed, there is reason to believe, that after “ the rapid method” an early x*elapse is mox'e common than aftei’ other's, and that the cicatrices of these split structures contract faster than the original. Bad, and even fatal effects, moreover-, are more common after the splitting operation than after gradual dilatatiou. The plan of treatment by dilatation I have laid down is absolutely safe, and never is followed by a fatal result; but this caxxnot be said after the splitting of the structure, although facts are wanted to establish the px’opox'tion of fatal to the successful cases. To narrow, l'iug or annular, subpubic or penile strictures, Holt’sSTRICTURE OR THE URETHRA. 135 method is probably well adapted; but for indurated, ribbon, tunnel or complicated strictures, it is dangerous and unsuitable. When a stricture is associated with a vesical calculus and it is a stricture matter of necessity, to cure the one before lithotomy is employed, the with vesical immediate method may be used; but it ought to be understood, that a calculus, greater amount of danger attends its practice than follows the more ordinary method. The best instrument for this plan of treatment is that made by Weiss for Mr. B. W. Richardson, of Dublin. (Fig. 360.) Ejg. 360. Richardson’s dilator. Yet all strictures cannot be treated by dilatation, for “ cases occur occasionally which are so exquisitely sensitive that the passage of a catheter, however skilfully performed, is followed by such severe con- stitutional and local disturbance as to produce more harm than good, and in which it is clear some other method of cure must be employed, whilst there are others which are relieved by means of the catheter, and even fully dilated, but which have a tendency to re-contract im- mediately upon the omission of the treatment. In the former case the treatment aggravates instead of relieves the symptoms; in the latter it must be continued for life to preserve an open passage. Under such circumstances some other plan of treatment must be adopted;” and I believe now, as when the above words were written, “the most beneficial to be the external division of the stricture from the perinseum; External and it is to the late Professor Syme that we are here especially indebted division of for having so ably recalled our attention to the treatment of such troublesome and painful cases” (‘Guy’s Reports,’ 1858). perimeum. The surgeon must not, however, in all cases of irritable stricture come When to the conclusion, that Syme’s operation is required, as it is only in nPPlica,lle- exceptional examples that it is needed. For in some, the irritability rapidly disappears under the use of the catheter, and in others rest, alkalies, and opium have a most beneficial influence. If these fail, the cutting operation may be performed. Recently the laminaria stalks have been employed for dilating stric- Laminaria tore, but for perineal strictures they are dangerous, and are apt to break. tcnts- For strictures at the orifice of the urethra, from the contraction of cicatrices they are most valuable, but for all other forms they are ill adapted. A laminaria tent swells to at least twice its dia- meter, and may be introduced into the urethra dry and left there, a small shield being fixed to one end to prevent its slipping into the passage. Caustics are not, at the present day, much employed in the treatment Caustics, of stricture; indeed, few use them. The practice in theory is neither sound, nor in its results certain, indeed it is probably inju- rious, since it is impossible to apply such a caustic as the potassa fusa to the seat of stricture alone, and, when tissues are destroyed by its influence, they will subsequently cicatrise and contract, and thus add to the mischief. The practice is not one in any way that can be recom- mended.URETHROTOMY. 136 Internal urethrotomy. Instruments. External urethrotomy. Syme’s operation. Fig. 3G1. Urethrotomy is a comprehensive term, and includes the internal division of a stricture from the urethra as well as the external through the periuseum. Internal urethrotomy has now many advocates, and in hard old strictures it is preferable to their rupture; for strictures also at the orifice of the urethra and within the penis, it is a safe and valuable practice. In the hands of some surgeons it has been much practised advantageously, and Mr. Lund, of Manchester, has lately advocated it. Many instruments have been invented for the purpose, and Stafford’s instrument, made in 1827, is well known. Fergusson employed a long grooved director, which he passed through the stricture, and a vex-y narrow-bladed knife, which can be buried in the groove. Many ingenious instru- ments have been invented, but the best is that which divides the strictures from behind forwards on its withdrawal, such as that represented in Fig. 361. It is one that I have had made on Trelat’s pi’inciple, per- forated at its end for a guide bougie. In strictures of the orifice a bistoury may be used. After the division of the strictui’e, it was a common custom to pass a large catheter into the bladder and leave it in, but M. Gouley has fairly shown that such a practice is not required. In orificial strictures after their division, the laminaria tent is the best to use with a shield. Maisonneuve employed a filiform gum-elastic bougie as a guide through the stricture, as well as a grooved steel director which is screwed to the bougie and pushed into the bladder. He then divided the strictm’e by means of a triangular-shaped urethrotome passed along the groove, a large catheter being passed into the bladder when the stricture had been divided. Subcutaneous perineal urethi’otomy is on its trial, but my own experience of it has not been favourable. External urethrotomy is a valuable operation in se- lected cases, and includes three very different measures; one, in which the stricture is divided through the peri- nmum upon a grooved director passed through the stricture (external division or Syme’s Operation). The second, in which the urethra is opened in front of the stricture and a grooved probe passed through it into the bladder previous to its division (Wheelhouse’s opera- tion). And the third, in which the perinseum is laid open without a urethral guide—the stricture being im- pervious—and to this the term perineal section ought to be confined (Cock’s operation). Syme’s Operation as already stated, is valuable in the highly irritable as Urethrotome, perforated at end for guide bougie.137 wheelhouse’s operation. well as contractile stricture, in cases which Syme described as strictures that “ continue to present symptoms after being dilated,” and that “are indomitable by the ordinary means of treatment.” It is, moreover, usually successful. The operation is by no means one of difficulty. A grooved staff as large as can he passed through the stricture is first introduced, the patient having been placed upon his back as if about to be cu( for stone. The surgeon should then with perfect precision introduce his knife into the centre of the perinseum, and at one stroke, cut down upon the groove situated at the lower border of the staff; and using this as his guide, the perineal portion of the urethra in which the stricture is situated can he readily and freely divided. There are but two important points to be observed in this the second step of the operation; the first is to be certain that the knife touches the groove of the staff, and secondly that the whole of the diseased or strietured portion of the urethra is freely divided. Having succeeded in this, the essential part of the operation, and after a grooved probe or director has been introduced into the bladder through the perineal wound, the sound may he removed, when either a full-sized elastic cathe- ter can he readily introduced through the penis into the bladder and fixed in; or Syme’s catheter (Fig. 362) may he introduced through the perineal wound for twenty-four hours. Fio. 362. The patient should then he sent to bed, and a mild opiate given such as ten grains of Dover’s powder, if much general or local vesical irritability exists. The catheter may be left in for several days if it fail to cause pain, but if the bladder resents its presence it may be removed; indeed, recent experience has led me to think that the presence of a catheter is scarcely required, although more experience is called for before the omission of its use can be confidently recom- mended. After the wound has closed, the occasional introduction of a catheter is essential, and I cordially agree with Professor Syme in thinking “ prudence requires that every patient who has had a stricture divided should learn to introduce bougies, since by doing so, at intervals of a week or a fortnight, he will be perfectly secure from future ti ouble. I he division of a stricture no more effects a permanent cure than its dilatation or rupture, and occasional dilatation is essen- tial to maintain its patency. Wheelhouse’s Operation. Mr. C. G. Wheelhouse, of Leeds, however, has introduced an opera- tion for impermeable stricture which I believe deserves attention. Points to be attended to. After- treatment. Occasional use of eatiieters necessary.WHEELHOUSE’S OPERATION. 138 * Operation described. He states that in his hands and in those of his colleagues it has been most successful. The instruments required for its performance are as follows: “ Lithotomy bandages; a special staff, fully grooved through the greater part, but not through the whole, of its extent, the last half inch of the groove being “stopped,” and terminating in a rounded button-like end (Fig. 363); an ordinary scalpel; two pairs of straight- Fig. 863. Grooved staff, with button-like end. bladed forceps, nibbed at the points; ordinary artery forceps and ligatures; sponge; a well-grooved and finely probe-pointed director; Fig. 364. Teale’s probe-gorget. Teale’s probe-gorget (Fig. 364); a straight probe-pointed bistoury; a short silver catheter (No. 10 or 11 gauge), with elastic tube attached. The patient is placed in lithotomy position, with the pelvis a little elevated, so as to permit the light to fall well upon it, and into the wound to be made. The staff is to be introduced with the groove looking towards the surface, and brought gently into contact with the stricture. It should not be pressed much against the stricture, for fear of tearing the tissues of the urethra, and causing it to leave the canal, which would mar the whole after-proceedings, which depend upon the urethra being opened a quarter of an inch in front of the stricture. Whilst an assistant holds the staff in this position, an incision is made into the perinseum, extending from opposite the point of reflection of the superficial perinseal fascia to the anterior edge of the sphincter ani. The tissues of the perineum are to be steadily divided until the urethra is reached. This is now to be opened in the groove of the staff, not upon its point, so as certainly to secure a quarter of an inch of healthy tube immediately in front of the stricture. As soon as the urethra is opened, and the groove in the staff fully exposed, the edges of the healthy urethra are to be seized on each side by the straight-bladed nibbed forceps, and held apart. The staff is then to be gently withdrawn, until the button- point appears in the wound. It is then to be turned round, so that the groove may look to the pubes, and the button may be hooked into the upper angle of the opened urethra, which is then held stretched open at three points thus (Fig. 365), and the operator looks into it imme- diately in front of the stricture. Whilst thus held open, the probe- pointed director is inserted into the urethra; and the operator, if he cannot see the opening of the stricture, which is often possible, gene-139 EXTERNAL URETHROTOMY. rally succeeds in very quickly finding it, and passes the point onwards through the stricture towards the bladder. The stricture is sometimes hidden amongst a crop of granulations or warty growths, m the midst Wheelliouse’s operation of opening urethra. of which the probe-point easily finds the true passage. This director having been passed on into the bladder (its entrance into which is clearly demonstrated by the freedom of its movements), its groove is turned downwards, the whole length of the stricture is carefully and deliberately divided on its under surface, and the passage is thus cleared. The director is still held in the same position, and the straight probe-pointed bistoury is run along the groove, to insure complete division of all bands or other obstructions. These being thoroughly cleared, the old difficulty of directing the point of a catheter through the divided stricture and onwards into the bladder is to be overcome. To effect this, the point of the probe-gorget is introduced into the groove in the director, and, guided by it, is passed onwards into the bladder, dilating the divided stricture, and forming a metallic floor, along which the point of the catheter cannot fail to pass securely into the bladder. The entry of the gorget into the latter viscus is signalised by an immediate gush of urine along it. The short catheter is now passed from the meatus down into the wound; is made to pass once or twice through the divided urethra, where it can be seen in the wound, to render certain the fact that no obstructing bands have been left undivided; and is then, guided by the probe-dilator, passed easily and certainly along the posterior part of the urethra into the bladder. The gorget is now withdrawn; the catheter fastened in the urethra, and allowed to remain for three or four days; the elastic tube convey- ing the urine away to a vessel under or by the side of the bed. After three or four days the catheter is removed, and is then passed daily, or every second or third day, according to circumstances, until the wouud in the perinseum is healed; and, after the parts have become consolidated, it requires, of course, to be passed still from time to time to prevent recontraction.”URETHROTOMY. 110 Perineal section, when necessary. Cock’s operation. Mode of performance of external urethrotomy without a staff. Perineal Section or Cock’s Operation is a more difficult and dangerous operation than Syme’s, and is called for, moreover, in far more severe cases when the urethra is impervious and no guide to the urethra exists beyond that which the surgeon’s knowledge of the anatomy of the parts affords. It should also be re- membered that, as a rule, the normal anatomy has been nearly destroyed, for impervious strictures requiring urethrotomy are usually chronic, as well as complicated with extravasation, suppuration, or urinary fistulaj. The operation I shall describe is that one suggested by Mr. Cock, and known by his name; “ the objects aimed at in the operation can be accomplished, while I doubt if those of any other have ever been fulfilled. However complicated may he the derangement of the ptri- nseum, and however extensive the obstruction of the urethra, one portion of the canal behind the stricture is always healthy and often dilated, and is accessible to the knife of the surgeon. 1 mean that portion of the urethra which emerges from the apex of the prostate, a part which is never the subject of stricture, and whose exact ana- tomical position may be brought under the recognition of the finger of the operator. Thus, when we cannot introduce a catheter by the ordinary method, and even when we cannot tap the bladder through the rectum, it still remains to us to tap the urethra as it emerges from the prostate, and thus to effect the desired communication.” The operation which Mr. Cock has described as “tapping the urethra at the apex of the prostate, unassisted by a guide staff,” is performed in the following manner, and illustrated in Fig. 366. I have seen Mr. Fig. ofiG. Mr. Cock’s operation of tapping the urethra at the apex of the prostate. Cock frequently perform it, have done it myself on many occasions, and have no hesitation in strongly recommending it as the operation for external urethrotomy without a staff. I give it in Cock’s words, taken from ‘Guy’s Hospital lteports,’ 1866:—“The only instruments required are a broad double-edged knife with a very sharp point, a141 cock’s operation. large silver'probe-pointed director with a handle, and a canula or female catheter, modified so that it can be retained in the bladder (Syme’s perineal catheter is the best). “ The patient is to be placed in the usual position for lithotomy; and it is of the utmost importance that the body and pelvis should be straight, so that the median line may be accurately preserved. The left forefinger of the operator is then introduced into the rectum, the bearings of the prostate are carefully examined and ascertained, and the tip of the finger is lodged on the apex of the gland; the knife is then plunged steadily but boldly into the median line of the perinseum, and carried on in a direction towards the tip of the left forefinger, which lies in the rectum. (Fig. 366.) At the same time, by an up- ward and downward movement, the vertical incision may be carried in the median line to any extent that is considered desirable. The lower extremity of the wound should come to within half an inch of the anus. “ The knife should never be withdrawn in its progress towards the apex of the prostate; but its onward course must be steadily maintained until its point can be felt in close proximity to the tip of the left forefinger. When the operator has fully assured himself as to the relative position of his finger, the apex of the prostate and the point of his knife, the latter is to be advanced with a motion somewhat obliquely either to the right or the left, and it can hardly fail to pierce the urethra. If, in this step of the operation, the anterior extremity of the prostate should be somewhat incised, it is a matter of no consequence. “ In this operation it is of the utmost importance that the knife be Description not removed from the wound, and that no deviation be made from its of Cock’s original direction until the object is accomplished. If the knife be cJ^miuuil prematurely removed, it will probably, when reinserted, make a fresh incision and complicate the desired result. It will be seen that the wound, when complicated, represents a triangle; the base being the external vertical incision through the perinmum, while the apex, and consequently the point of the knife, impinges on the apex of the prostate. This shape of the wound facilitates the next step of the operation. “The knife is now withdrawn,but the left forefinger is still retained in the rectum. The probe-pointed director is carried through the wound, and guided by the left forefinger, enters the urethra, and is passed into the bladder. The finger is now withdrawn from the rec- tum, the left hand grasps the director, and along the groove of this instrument the canula is slid until it enters the bladder. “ The operation is now complete, and it only remains to secure the canula in its place with four pieces of tape, which are fastened to a girth round-the loins. “ A direct communication with the bladder has now been obtained and the relief to the patient will be immediate; unless the kidneys have become irremediably disorganized, we may confidently anticipate a favourable result; and the restoration of the urinary organs will be more or less complete, in proportion as the obstructed portion of the urethra is more or less amenable to the ordinary judicious treatment of stricture. “ The canula may generally be retained in the bladder for a few days,142 PEIUNEAL SECTION. Continuation of Cock’s description. and if the state of the urine renders ablution necessary the viscus may be frequently washed out. The canula may then be removed, cleansed, and reintroduced. A flexible catheter is sometimes more desirable and congenial to the feelings of the patient than a metallic canula. “ If the previous destruction has not been very great, and if the case progresses favourably, the swelling of the perinaeum and scrotum gradually subsides, the induration disappears, and the urinary sinuses become obliterated. The urethra may then be examined in the ordi- nary way, to test its permeability, and one may be agreeably surprised to find that the sound or catheter readily passes through the former stricture until it strikes against the canula. An attempt may then be made to introduce a flexible catheter into the bladder, and its passage may, if necessary, be facilitated by passing a director through the perinaeum into the bladder, and guiding the catheter along its groove. The urethra, once restored to its normal condition and calibre, the artificial opening through the perinaeum soon heals up, and, barring the liability of stricture to return if not attended to, the cure may be said to be complete. “ We must not, however, always expect so favourable a result. I have operated in several cases where the obstruction of the canal was complete, and impermeability permanent.” “ In such cases the patient is condemned to pass his water through the artificial opening in the periiueum, unless a new passage should be bored to unite the upper and lower portions of the patient’s urethra— an operation which I have seldom or never known to be successful.” “ The necessity of micturating through the perinaeum may seem to be a considerable hardship, but with a little arrangement the incon- venience is not very great; and be it remembered that the man’s micturition is merely assimilated to that of the other sex. “ To keep the artificial passage in a permeable state it is generally necessary to pass a flexible bougie through the opening occasionally, and to retain it in sit'd for a few hours. The patient very soon learns to do this for himself. “ I have now under my frequent observation two men, on one of whom I operated twenty-five years ago, on the other twenty; and both are thankful for their condition. “I have not found this operation, with its result, in a permanent factitious urethra, at all interferes with the sexual function, although it is, of course, a complete bar to procreation.” I have described fully this admirable operation in the words of its originator, and believe it to be the only form of perineal section that ought to be performed in an impervious urethra. It is not suffi- ciently known. In exceptional cases the surgeon may examine the urethra itself with the view to find a passage through it; and for this purpose, use as a guide to its distal end, a grooved staff introduced through the penis down to the obstruction; the two sides of the urethra being held well apart by forceps, or as suggested by Avery a loop of silk introduced through each edge of the divided urethra. If the surgeon be fortunate enough to slip a fine grooved director through, the stricture will be readily divided. Under these circumstances a catheter should be passed through the penis into the bladder, and the one which had been introduced through the perinaeum withdrawn. ICOMPLICATIONS OF STRICTURE. 143 need hardly say, however, that it is very rare for the surgeon to he able to trace the urethral passage through the stricture. Complications of Stricture. I have thus far dwelt upon permeable and impermeable organic Complica- stricture and its treatment, but have made only passing reference to its complications. I propose now to consider these points more fully, in- cluding perineal abscess, extravasation of urine, and perineal fistula, all of which are the direct results of stricture, and of local or diffused urinary extravasation. Extravasation of urine is a complication which will almost necessa- rily follow a neglected stricture, and the pathological process by which it is produced has been already described. It is one of the means which nature adopts to find an outlet for urine when the natural pas- sage has become so contracted as to forbid its flow, and a complication of great danger. It requires in its treatment, moreover, great decision on the part of the surgeon; the effect of retained urine upon any tissue of the body, except those naturally adapted for its contact, being gene- rally followed by sloughing. The early detection, therefore, of the be- ginning of an extravasation is important, and requires a few practical remarks. If a patient, the subject of a stricture, appears before a surgeon suf- Perineal fering from more or less severe febrile symptoms, a pnrched skin, dry tongue, and a rapid irritable pulse, with or without an occasional rigor, Symptoms, attention should always bej directed to the question of extravasation and a careful examination mnde of the perinmum and the parts around, whether there exist any local symptoms sufficient to have attracted the notice of the patient or not, when a circumscribed and almost solid mass will probably be discovered in the region of the bulb, which on firm pressure will be painful. The patient will frequently state that this existed for some weeks and cannot be the cause of all his symptoms. The surgeon, however, must not be misled, since this circumscribed mass is in effect a urinary abscess, the result of a local and limited extrava- sation, and the symptoms will only disappear when its contents have been evacuated. What treatment, then, should be pursued ? If the urethra be ex- Treatment, amined, the stricture will almost to a certainty be found much con- tracted, and the stream of urine very small. Some discharge from the urethra may perhaps be observed, a little of the pus contained within the abscess behind the stricture making its way by the natural pas- sage. If an instrument be made to pass the stricture, it may then only enter the dilated, ulcerated, aud suppurating cavity of the abscess situated behind, and it will be a matter of difficulty to find the vesical end of the urethra, and, as a consequence, the instrument will be passed onwards into the bladder in only exceptional cases. The abscess, however, must be opened and its contents evacuated ; Abscess to be for if not, it will to a certainty increase, and being bound down by laid open- the perineal fascia, pass backwards aud spread mischief around the neck of the bladder, and, in the cellular tissue of the pelvis, to the serious injury of the sufferer.

Division of stricture. Extravasa- tion of urine. Symptoms. Local conditions. I am well aware some are satisfied to open the abscess in the peri- useuin, and leave the stricture to be subsequently treated by dilatation or other means; yet such a measure is but temporising, and the soundest and most correct practice is to open the abscess, and at the same time to divide the stricture. This is readily done by passing a grooved staff through the urethra into the abscess, if not into the bladder, and freely dividing all the tissues by a scalpel introduced through the perinseum. If the orifice of the vesical end of the urethra can be detected with a probe, a large catheter should be passed and left in, hut this point is not of essential importance, as by the operation the surgeon is certain that the stricture has been divided, all pus freely evacuated, the possibility of further extravasation taking place prevented, and a free outlet for the urine at the same time been obtained. By adopting this practice much time is saved, the stricture being treated and probably cured by the same means that are absolutely essential for the treatment of the complication. When, however, perineal abscesses occur unconnected with stricture, they should be opened early to prevent their breaking into the urethra and degenerating into urinary fistula. Syme’s operation under these circumstances is not required. The complication of extravasation of urine, however, does not always appear in the form we have been just describing as a local and con- fined extravasation or a urinary abscess, since it not rarely shows itself as an extravasation of a severer nature; as one more sudden and marked in its symptoms and more fatal in its effects, requiring also at the hands of the surgeon active and energetic treatment. It occurs as the result of a sudden rupture of the urethra, or of the walls of an abscess communicating with it, the rupture taking place sud- denly during some effort of a patient, the subject of a narrow and contracted stricture to relieve his distended and overcharged bladder. The symptoms by which the complication is manifested are very marked. The patient will probably relate that during some sudden expulsive effort to pass his urine, he felt something give way, and that this sensation was attended with relief to the symptoms caused by the retention of urine. He will soon discover, however, that the relief which he experienced was not the result of a flow of urine from the natural passage; and, from the rapid enlargement of the perinseum, scrotum, and penis, will he convinced that something wrong has taken place. This swelling will be attended by a burning pain in the parts thus gradually enlarging, and increased at each effort made to relieve the distended bladder—the absence of pain on the first onset of the extra- vasation may delude the patient into a false idea of relief and safety. The surgeon, if now called to see the patient, will find him labouring under retention of urine, with the perinseum, penis, and scrotum more or less swollen and cedematous from urinary infiltration; the extravasated fluid, perhaps, having made or making its way upwards over the abdominal parietes even to the thorax. If the symptoms have existed long, a peculiar inflammation and gangrene of the integuments will make its appearance, and all the constitutional symptoms described as typhoid will certainly be present. Under these circumstances the surgeon, in his treatment, has three Treatment.145 EXTRAVASATION OF URINE. objects to keep in mind; first, to free the tissues, already infiltrated, of their extravasated urine, and thus prevent their total destruc- tion ; the second, to secure a free and ready outlet for the urine from the bladder, and thus relieve the retention and prevent an extension of mischief; and the third, which is no less important, to cure the stric- ture, and thereby remove the cause on which the complication originally depended. The first object is readily secured by free incisions made through the integument into the infiltrated cellular tissue, the second may perhaps be fortunately secured by the passage of a catheter, which when it fails, the object may be obtained by puncturing the bladder through the rectum ; but this latter practice is only a partial remedy, and not scien- tific ; it relieves immediate symptoms, but nothing more, leaving the stricture, the “ fous et origo rnali,” unnoticed and untreated. The right treatment, therefore, is the one which will relieve the retention, give free vent to the infiltrated urine and treat the stricture, that is, which can of itself fulfil the three required conditions to which attention has been drawn; and this is found in either the external division of the stric- ture, or in the perineal section. By either operation, the obstruction to the flow of urine is removed and the stricture divided, an outlet is obtained for the urine which has been infiltrated, and a free vent given for subsequent micturition. Free incisions, therefore, ought to be made into the parts infiltrated with urine, as well as the perineal incision ex- tensive and deep enough to lay bare and open freely the urethra, doing this, if possible, upon a grooved staff, forced through the stricture, and when this end cannot be attained, by the operation which has been already described in another page. A small grooved staff may, however, be passed in by far the majority of cases, the employment of some force being perfectly justifiable to make it pass through the strictural portion. Fig. 367. Urinary fistulae. These may be the result of a urinary abscess bursting in the perinamm or scrotum, or the consequence of a more diffused urinary extravasation, the fistulae, under these latter circumstances, appearing in the perinaeum', VOL.

Fistula after lithotomy. Fistula opening into rectum. scrotum, groin, tliighs, pubes, or nates (Fig. 367). They are generally the direct consequence of some urethral obstruction. Occasionally, however, they follow an accidental wound in the perinaeum or urethra, or some such operation as lithotomy. When the fistulse are simple tracts communicating with a urethra behind a stricture, and the tissues through which they pass are healthy, they need not be regarded with any anxiety, as, in all possibility, they will rapidly heal so soon as the urine flows readily the natural way after the dilatation of the stricture. When, however, the fistulas pass through indurated and diseased tissues and are associated with a contracted if not impermeable urethra, or are the result of some urinary extravasation and sloughing of the parts, the same success is not always secured. It is true that in a large number of cases when the stricture is dilated and cured the fistulm will close, but in exceptional cases they refuse to heal, and require the local stimulation of some such escharotic as the nitrate of silver, liquor ammonite, tincture of cantliarides, the galvanic or actual cautery, to stimulate the indolent passage and assist its contrac- tion. It should be remembered, also, that in all these cases it is the entrance of the urine into the fistulae which prevents their contraction and closure, and that any means by which such an occurrence can be prevented will be followed by recovery. To allow the patient to pass his urine is most injurious. To pass a plugged catheter into the urethra and leave it in will not suffice, as daily experience proves that urine soon flows by the side of the catheter and enters the fistula, the intro- duction of a vulcanite inelastic catheter into the bladder with its end open, is, however, a good practice, the urine flowing away as secreted. The best plan is, to have a catheter passed whenever the bladder re- quires to be emptied, and where the surgeon has dilated the stricture to its full size, as well as instructed the patient to pass an elastic catheter into the bladder, there are very few instances of urinary fistula that require further treatment. When difficulty is experienced in dilating the stricture, Syme’s operation may be performed, the surgeon when he can, laying open the fistula at the same time. The urinary fistula following lithotomy is best dealt with by the galvanic cautery and catheterism. In these cases, however, the sur- geon should always investigate the case sufficiently to assure himself of the absence of a second stone, or of a foreign body within the wound, for I have known in one case a sponge, that had been applied to arrest bleeding, left in the wound and prevent repair. In another a second calculus was overlooked, and prevented recovery, the fistula healed when the stone had been expelled by natural efforts through the fistulous perineal opening. I have likewise seen two cases where some calculous formations took place in the wound and thus kept it open. Urinary fistula the result of some abscess communicating with the rectum will generally heal as soon as the urine is prevented from en- tering the passage. The use of the catheter will sometimes effect this; at others, position will suffice, Sir H. Thompson gives a case in which recovery followed the practice of micturating in the prone position for a month. But any means that for a time prevents the passage of urine into the fistula will probably suffice to allow of its contraction. When this does not succeed, the passage may be stimulated by the gal-147 CICATRICIAL STRICTURE. vanic or other cautery, and, in exceptional cases, a plastic operation may be called for. The urinary fistula; associated with loss of tissue, whether in the Fistula with penis, scrotum, or perinamm, require the greatest amount of ingenuity loss of tissue, in the surgeon, as, besides the constriction of the normal channel some plastic operation is often necessary. On Cicatricial or Traumatic Stricture. The difference in the cause, the difficulties in the treatment, and Traumatic the permanency in the nature of a so-called traumatic stricture, have stricture, led me to separate the cases thus denominated from that larger class which we have been just considering, the result of local inflammations, and from my notes of forty-three consecutive examples of this kind, in i all of which a distinct history could be obtained of some definite History and accident affecting the perinteum, the blow or fall was immediately fol- causes, lowed by haemorrhage from the urethra, with or without other symptoms, and, at a later date, by difficulty in micturition. As a rule, these accidents take place in boyhood or in young adult life, though no age is free from the dangers of such an injury, and the kick of a man or horse on the perinaeum, a fall upon a pointed instru- ment, or across a bar, beam, or rail; an injury from a saddle when riding, a blow from a rope, and sloughing of the perinaeum after a violent contusion, are the principal causes to which the stricture has been assigned in the cases before me. In one and all there was clear evidence at the time of the injury that the urethra was more or less involved, as hsematuria in almost every case immediately followed, while difficulty in micturition appeared subsequently at variable intervals. In some few cases, several years had passed away before the attention of the patient was called to the smallness of his stream of urine, when some sudden attack of retention was the first symptom which attracted notice; but in the majority of cases, the difficulty of micturition appeared rapidly after the receipt of the primary injury, and went on slowly but surely to increase. The pathology of these cases is not difficult to understand. The ure- Pathology, thra, by the injury, is either partially or wholly ruptured, the wound being transverse; union takes place, and subsequently contraction of the cicatricial tissue, with a narrowing of the urethra and the formation of a traumatic stricture follow. It is this pathological fact which enables us to explain the obstinacy of the symptoms and the difficulty in the treatment. Complications.—Traumatic stricture is as liable as any other organic Complica- stricture to be followed by like complications, since these complications tions- are the result of the obstruction to the urethra, and it is of little con- sequence in what way that obstruction may primarily have been caused. Among my forty-three examples of traumatic stricture, twenty-seven were admitted simply on account of their contracted stream and difficulty in micturition; in eight, retention of urine was the immediate cause; in three, extravasation of urine; and in five urinary fistula complicated the cases. Treatment.—There are no cases of complicated or non-complicated Treat organic stricture more obstinate in their treatment than the so-called traumatic, and the nature of the obstruction being cicatricial is quite sufficient to account for this fact, since it is well known that all148 CAUSES OF DEATH FROM STRICTURE. Its obstinacy. Dilatation Perineal section. Statistics of results in treatment. Causes of death from stricture. cicatrices have a constant and almost perpetual tendency to contract. A traumatic stricture, the result of a contracting cicatrix, is conse- quently in its nature essentially a contractile stricture, and its treatment is, therefore, very troublesome. When treated by dilatation, it will re- contract, and even if treated by perineal section or external division, it is far more likely to return than any form of inflammatory stricture. All forms of treatment are consequently uncertain and unsatisfactory. If dilatation of the urethra is once secured, the introduction of a cath- eter at short intervals is most essential, or otherwise, the canal is certain to re-contract; and, if it is doubtful whether any case of simple inflam- matory stricture is ever really cured, it may unquestionably be asserted that a traumatic stricture will exist for life, and that it will require constant and repeated treatment to preserve even a moderate patency of the narrowed passage. The principles of treatment in both varieties, however, are the same, although the practice may not he so successful. If the urethra be permeable, the treatment by dilatation should be primarily employed and persevered in for some time if success is to be secured. If the stricture is so narrow and indurated as to refuse dila- tation and a grooved staff can be passed through, the operation of external division is the soundest practice, and gives the surest hopes of immediate and future benefit. If the stricture be impermeable, and from its narrowness require immediate treatment; or should its complications, either of extrava- sation or urinary fistula, demand attention, the perineal section must be carried out in the same manner as in the cases previously referred to. If extravasation of urine be present as a secondary result of this traumatic stricture, the same principles and practice which have been advocated in the treatment of simple organic stricture are equally ap- plicable ; as are also the recommendations which have been made for the treatment of periueal fistula. The permanent success, however, of the practice in these traumatic cases is not nearly so great as in the inflammatory, although the practice in both is really the same. It is hardly necessary to illustrate these facts, as the experience of all surgeons will bear them out. To show the greater severity of these cases and the difficulties of their treatment by dilatation, it may be stated, that out of the forty- three examples of traumatic stricture which have been tabulated, in six, or 14 per cent, of the whole number, the operation of perineal section or of external division was absolutely required; whereas, amongst the cases of simple organic stricture, only 6 per cent, re- quired such operative interference—the simple treatment by dilatation answering every other purpose. The Causes of Death from Stricture. There are few local diseases which, if neglected, have a more fatal tendency than urethral stricture; and certainly there are none in which the progress towards evil can be so accurately and clearly traced. If the portion of the urethra situated behind the stricture is the part which primarily experiences the evil influence of the obstruction, the bladder becomes subsequently involved, and last, but not least the ureters and kidneys. The importance of the kidneys in the animal149 TREATMENT OF STRICTURE. economy ns excretory organs receives thus a fresh demonstration from the fatal effects of disease in their structure. To assert that renal disease is the sole cause of death from stricture would not, perhaps, be strictly true; nevertheless, it is the principal one, and if these glands are not involved, stricture and its complica- tions are not fatal. Simple uncomplicated stricture is not a fatal disease, few cases ter- minating in death. Stricture and retention of urine is a more serious combination, and stricture with extravasation of urine is still more fatal. It would thus appear that it is only when stricture has existed for a lengthened period and become complicated, that its fatal influence becomes apparent—the increase in the mortality of the eases increasing with the severity of the complication. The duration of the stricture has necessarily a serious influence in producing a fatal result; the longer the obstruction exists, the greater the probability, if not certainty, of the production of renal affection. In 26 fatal cases, the notes of which are before me, the average duration of the stricture was seventeen years; iu 5, symptoms had existed under ten years, and in 10, for upwards of twenty years. When stricture, therefore, has existed for a long period, and more particularly when it has been neglected, it may he inferred with cer- tainty that some disease of the kidneys has been produced, and that the slightest injury or accession of mischief is likely to terminate iu ; death; for I imagine that every subject of renal disease stands, as it were, continually on the edge of a precipice, and that the slightest adverse wind may send him down. The death of so many i cases after operations, whether upon the urinary organs or other parts, may be thus explained. No patient with renal disease is able to resist the slightest tax upon his powers, for his vital energy sinks irrecover- ably upon the receipt of the most trifliug injury. By way of summary of the treatment of stricture the following conclusions may be drawn :— 1. At least ninety-five out of every hundred cases of stricture are readily and safely dilated by means of catheters, and every stricture might be so treated^!' recognised before auy complications appeared. 2. Of permeable strictures, it is only in the obstinately irritable and contractile forms that any other treatment is called for; and in these, external division, by the plan recommended by Syme, is probably 1 the best operation; though rapid, dilatation, splitting, or internal division of the stricture may be justifiable under exceptional con- ditions. 3. Strictures complicated] with urinary abscess or extravasation, in which pei’ineal incisions are called for, should be treated by external division or by Syme’s operation, when a staff can be passed through the stricture; by perineal section, Wheelhouse’s or Cock’s operation, when no such guide can be employed. 4. In strictures complicated with urinary fistula, the stricture itself should be treated, its full dilatation being usually followed by the I contraction of the fistulas. When this result does not take place, it is essential that all urine be prevented passing into the fistulas, and the best means to ensure this is, by the passage of the catheter whenever i relief is required. Renal disease. Influence of duration ot stricture. Summary of treatment of stricture.150 RUPTURED URETHRA. 5. The external division of the stricture is an excellent operation in obstinate cases of permeable, contractile, and irritable strictures; in all cases of extravasation of urine in which perineal incisions are called for, and also, in long indurated strictures complicated with urinary fistulas. 6. Perineal section, Wheelhouse’s or Cock’s operation, is good in all cases of impermeable stricture or obliterated urethra, complicated or not with urinary abscess or fistula, in which a free outlet for the escape of urine is essential. 7. Internal urethrotomy, except iu penile or in the obstinately irritable or contractile strictures, is not often required, and the treat- ment by caustics is dangerous. 8. Cicatricial strictures should be treated as others; but they are far more obstinate, and require more frequently external ure- throtomy. On Ruptured Urethra. Rupture of urethra. Mode of oucurreuce. Symptoms. Treatment. Catheterism. The secondary effects of an injury to, or a rupture of, the urethra have already been considered under the heading of traumatic stricture; and it has been shown, that in at least 6-65 per cent, of the cases of organic stricture, an injury was the assigned cause. It has also been shown that the worst and most intractable cases of stricture, as well as the majority of examples of obliterated urethra are of this kind. I propose now to consider the subject of ruptured or injured urethra with its immediate effects and treatment. In the majority of instances the injury is caused by some direct violence applied to the perinseum, such as a fall astride a post, plank, fence, or chair, a blow or kick on the perineum. In not a few instances, the injury has been produced by the passage of a cart wheel across the pelvis, though it may be somewhat difficult to understand how such a result can be produced by this cause, unless some fracture of the pubic portion of the pelvis coexists; but explain it how we may, in practice we meet with cases of ruptured urethra following the passage of a wheel across the pelvis, and unconnected with any other distinct evidence of fracture. The characteristic symptom of a rupture or laceration of the urethra is the passage of blood, which appears usually as an immediate result of the injury, which may be little or profuse in quantity, although it seldom endangers life, and, as a rule, subsides without treatment. If the injury has not been severe, it is just possible that this is the only symptom by which the laceration can be recognised; and if some time has elapsed between its receipt and the calls of nature to relieve the bladder, micturition may be completed with little or no difficulty, and convalescence re-established. It is not often, however, that the subject of a lacerated or ruptured urethra escapes so easily, for in the majority of cases, retention or extravasation of urine is the result, and for the relief of this the advice of the surgeon is generally at once sought. When called to attend a patient who has been the subject of an injury to the urethra suffering from simple retention, the first object is to attempt the passage of a catheter; and, if the urethra be not completely torn away and there is not much blood locally effused,151 RETENTION OF URINE. there is a strong probability that he will succeed. Having accom- plished this, the instrument should be fastened in and the urine allowed to flow away as secreted, being conducted at once by means of a tube into a vessel placed close at hand ; for, if the catheter be plugged, urine is sure to find its way by it's side into the perineum ; consequently a gum elastic or vulcanite instrument, with a strong stylet, should be employed. If the attempt at catheterism then fail, some other means must be employed to provide an outlet for the urine, as extravasation, with all its danger, will necessarily follow. Under these circum- stances an incision into the perineum on a grooved staff is unques- Perineal tionably the soundest practice to adopt; as by this means the extra-incision, vasated blood and urine find a ready outlet, and the bladder when it contracts, a vent for its contents—the danger of extravasation of urine being prevented. When the perineum has been laid open and the two ends of the Treatment of divided urethra can be made out, they may be brought together by a the ruptured suture; and, if the orifice of the vesical end of the ruptured urethra can be found with a grooved probe, ,a catheter should be passed, the instrument having been first introduced through the penis, and subse- quently guided upon the grooved probe into the bladder. If difficulty is experienced in finding the orifice, there need be no alarm, as it is quite clear that the urine will readily find its way externally through the artificial wound; nevertheless, an early attempt to pass the catheter should certainly be made, as it is most important that the con- tinuity of the urethra should be restored as early as possible. When a catheter has been introduced, it must be left, since it is important that the patency of the canal should be maintained during the whole period of its repair, and its subsequent contraction in a measure neutralised. The frequent passage of an instrument after the repair has taken place is an important point to be observed, this practice being the best guarantee that a cicatricial stricture cannot ensue. In the case of a man I treated seventeen years before for retention following a ruptured urethra by a perineal incision, there has not since been any difficulty in micturition. RETENTION OF URINE. When a patient is unable to pass his urine, he is said to be the sub- Retention of ject of retention, which may be due to the presence of organic or urine, cicatricial stricture, spasm of the urethra, urethral obstruction Causes, from inflammation of the urethra or prostate, urethral calculus, and many other causes. I have already stated, that retention existed in 129 out of 608 cases of organic stricture admitted into Guy’s during statistics seven years; and in 5 out of 43 cases of traumatic stricture. It was also present in 80 other cases, the result of varied causes unassociated with stricture. Spasmodic stricture was the assigned cause in half i.e., it was found in subjects in whom no permanent narrowing of the canal existed. In almost all, excess of drinking, with or without exposure to wet and cold were the exciting causes, and no complication aggravated the cases. One was in a boy, set. 10, who paid the penalty of a drink- ing bout by suffering the pain of a retention. Catheterism relieved152 RETENTION OF URINE. Spasmodic stricture. Causes. Treatment.

Retention in a child is generally from stone impacted in the urethra; in an adult, from stricture; and in an old man, from prostatic disease. Spasmodic Stricture as a cause of Retention. The existence of a true spasmodic stricture is no longer a subject of doubt. That the seat of the stricture is the membranous portion of the urethra, which is encircled by muscles, is also now generally acknow- ledged; and, that the usual exciting causes are exposure to wet or cold, and excess in drinking, many cases before me clearly prove. Anything, however, which can induce an altered or acid state of the urine is likely to be followed by this complication, gouty and rheumatic patients being particularly liable to such attacks. The treatment of such cases is not difficult; the simple passage of a large metallic catheter being the most expeditious and certain practice. The instrument should be well warmed and freely oiled, and then passed slowly, so as not to excite alarm or increase the spasm of the muscles. In skilful hands its introduction is not an operation of difficulty. If, however, the operator be foiled in his endeavours, he must be cautious not to employ force, which is never required and never justifiable. Chloroform should then be administered, and with a patient fully under its influence, all obstruction ceases, while the instrument will pass into the bladder. If there be an objection to the use of the anaesthetic, the old remedy of a hot hath cannot be too highly extolled; few patients suffering from simple retention failing to micturate when thus immersed; and the introduction of a catheter, moreover, is much facilitated. A full opiate is also an invaluable remedy, relieving the involuntary contraction of the bladder which is so painful in cases of retention, and thus re- moving one of the most constant causes of spasmodic stricture. The value of opium in these cases, according to some, cannot be upheld too strongly, indeed they assert that there is no case of retention of urine which will not yield to its benign influence, allowing either a natural relief or the introduction of a catheter. I am not disposed to go quite so far in this opinion, although the evidence of experience is generally in its favour, and, in cases of retention, it acts sometimes as a charm. The inhalation of chloroform I believe to be a preferable remedy—its action being more rapid and certain. If failure follow the application of these, other measures must be adopted; and without doubt the simplest, safest, and most expeditious practice is puncturing the bladder through the rectum. In a simple spasmodic stricture, however, such a necessity can scarcely arise. Inflammatory Stricture as a cause of Retention. It has been already shown, that in spasmodic stricture, exposure to wet or cold, and an altered condition of the urine produced either from excess of drinking, gout, or rheumatism are the chief exciting causes of an attack of retention; and if this be true, there can be no diffi- culty in understanding that a like result may be bi'ought about, and is more liable to be experienced, if the urethra itself should be the seat of an inflammatory notion. Retention of urine occasionally comes beforeRETENTION OF URINE. 153 our notice as a result and concomitant of gonorrhoea. The causes of the retention are evidently compound, viz. spasmodic stricture added to the mechanical obstruction produced by the oedema of an acute inflam- mation combining to produce the result. The treatment required to afford relief must he based upon the Treatment, appreciation of these two conditions which have combined to cause the effect. The retention is in a measure mechanical, and must be met by mechanical treatment; but it is also functional, and, as a conse- quence, must be so considered. The symptoms being urgent, time is, therefore, a great object; and if called to a case, there are few surgeons who would not at once attempt to pass a catheter. Let the surgeon choose an instrument of medium size.

If these means fail, a hot bath and a full opiate are the soundest Opiates, remedies. They relieve the local turgescence of the passage, and also the obstruction, and with it the associated spasm. In some instances the introduction of a piece of ice into the rectum serves a like pur- pose. The use of chloroform in these cases cannot be recommended, as it merely relieves the spasm but does not alter the condition upon which the spasm depends, viz., the inflammation. When these means fail, which is not commonly the case, some operative measure may be required, which will be dwelt upon in another page. Retention of urine following a blow in the perineeum.—Under this Retention heading it is not my intention to allude to cases of ruptured urethra, from ljl°" in as this condition has already been considered. But cases of retention Pcrimeum- occasionally come under notice which follow a simple contusion in the perinamm. I possess three such records—two in children aged three and seven respectively, and one in an adult aged twenty-nine. In none of these cases could haemorrhage or other symptom of rup- tured urethra be made out. The retention followed the contusion, and was caused by some spasmodic condition of the passage excited by the injury. In all the cases, the simple passage of a catheter was the only treatment, and, with the relief of the symptoms convalescence followed. Retention of urine from the pressure of an abscess in the perineeum Retention must be mentioned, as cases of retention from such a cause occasionally from come under notice, while abscess about the rectum is not uufrequently Pressure °f associated with such a difficulty. It should be treated by opening the '*>SCC3S' abscess. Paralysis of the bladder from any cause situated either in the Retention organ itself or associated with spinal disease, is a common cause of fr°m retention, and the same complication may be found with fever or any Pj!r?'/s*s of other constitutional condition in which the vital powers of the patieut adder- have been much reduced, and the nervous system has, as a conse- quence, become unable to answer to its accustomed stimulus. Re- tention of urine is also met with as a symptom of peritonitis, local or general, from traumatic stricture, or, as a result of some’ other abdominal disease. To prevent any error being perpetrated, however, it is enough for the surgeon to remember, tlint this complication may be produced by the causes enumerated.RETENTION OP URINE. 151. Incontinence of urine oiteu present, Retention from enlarged prostate. Treatment. Retention due to an elongated prepuce. It is not to treat retention of urine, however, that the surgeon is usually called to such cases. An incontinence of urine is generally the form of malady which attracts notice, and from this the surgeon rightly infers that a case of severe retention of urine is before him, the incontinence being merely the overflow of an already overdis- tended and engorged bladder. The symptom of incontinence is a very positive one, and should never mislead any practitioner. It is almost always a concomitant and result of retention, and should be so regarded, at any rate until the surgeon has convinced himself, by a careful examination, that the bladder is not distended. Eetention of Urine as a symptom of Enlarged Prostate, and in the Aged. It has been a common opinion held by all surgeons for many generations, that an enlarged prostate is a very general con- dition of old age, and retention of urine, as a consequence and symptom of this affection is of frequent occurrence. The inves- tigations of recent pathologists have shown, however, that such an opinion is by no means correct; for although an enlargement of the prostate, either as an hypertrophy, or from the development of independent prostatic glandular tumours may take place, and, when it does, it is most commonly met with in old people, yet such a condition is by no means to he considered as a senile change. When retention of urine takes place in old people in whom no stric- ture exists, it is too frequently ascribed to this chronic enlargement of the prostate, and as it is really a rare thing to find such a condition in the bodies of those that die, it is fair to believe, that this retention is due to other causes, such as atony of the bladder, which may be re- lieved by the introduction of a large catheter. This operation should always be undertaken with great care, as an injury to the prostate or bladder in old people is of considerable consequence. An elastic in- strument with a full curve, in the hands of those who are not in the constant habit of using instruments is to be preferred, and this may be passed slowly down to the neck of the bladder. It is at this point that the difficulty in its introduction is always experienced; but if the index-finger of the left hand be introduced into the rectum and the end of the instrument tilted upwards by the slightest pressure with the right hand, the catheter, as a rule, will be readily passed onward, and relief secured. Retention of urine may also be produced by an abscess situated in the prostate gland, and the retention is only relieved when the abscess has been opened. This treatment, therefore, is that which should be followed. Eetention of Urine as a result of an Elongated and Adherent Prepuce. It is a somewhat inexplicable fact that surgical writers have, with rare exceptions, omitted to notice that an elongated prepuce and adhesion of the glans penis to its mucous membrane covering, is capable of producing retention of urine with every symptom of vesical irrita- tion ; yet few surgeons can have had much experience at any hospital or dispensary, particularly in out-patient practice, without seeing many such examples. I could quote cases in which an adherent prepuce had been the cause both of retention and of incontinence of urine, and in which it had produced symptoms of irritable bladder and every155 RETENTION OF URINE. other symptom of vesical calculus, even lisematuria, prolapsus recti, or Vanetyof constant priapism. _ caused by All, or nearly all these cases take place in early life, and 1 never adherent see a case of vesical irritation in a male child without first examining prepuce, the condition of the penis. I have been in the habit of pointing out this fact to students for some years, and have advised them to follow the practice suggested under the conviction, that in at least two thirds of the cases suffering from urinary irritation which pass under observa- tion, an adherent and elongated prepuce is the sole cause. Circum- Treatment, cision and the careful separation of the prepuce from the glans penis, with the removal of the confined secretion of Tyson’s glands, is the only remedy, which is at once simple and complete. Retention of urine as a symptom of ruptured urethra has already received attention in another page. On Retention of Urine from Organic or Cicatricial Stricture. Among the many contingencies to which a patient suffering from Retention organic stricture is continually exposed, none cause more agony and du® t0 alarm, or demand more prompt and decisive action on the part of the stricture, surgeon, than retention of urine. The retention may be the result of a slowly contracting organic stricture; but it will probably be produced by some sudden accession of spasm of the muscles of the passage, and thus be compound in its nature, a spasmodic being grafted upon an organic stricture. The symptoms, however, are necessarily urgent, and it becomes an im- portant question as to what practice should be pursued. With this object, it will he of interest to inquire, first of all, what practice has been proved of value ? and, as a means to the solution of the difficulty Treatment. I can show, that out of 129 consecutive examples of retention from simple organic stricture, 109 were successfully treated by means of catheterism, warm baths, and opium. In 20 cases only, or 15-8 per cent., were any other operative measures called into requisition, and in all of these 20 examples, the bladder was punctured per rectum with complete success. Out of 8 cases also of retention of urine produced by the gradual In traumatic contraction of a traumatic stricture, 5 were treated by means of cathe- stricture, terism, and 3 by puncture of the bladder. The proportion of cases requiring such an operation, being much greater in traumatic stric- tures than in the preceding class of simple organic stricture; the cause of this difference being very apparent. If a surgeon is called to a patient suffering from retention of urine produced by either a simple spasmodic or an inflammatory stricture, it has already been explained that relief can be obtained by the cautious introduction of a catheter, aided, if required, by the use of the warm r H t bath or a full dose of opium, and, in certain cases, by the inhalation of tlietensm- chloroform. If these means fail, as experience proves mav be the case either from some peculiarity of the stricture, or the manner in which the treatment has been carried out, other measures will necessarily be called into requisition; and it has been already stated, that the best and most expeditious practice is to puncture the bladder through the rectum. Puncture per It is true that this practice is rarely needed in simple spasmodic or in rectum, inflammatory stricture, for the means already suggested are, in the majority of cases, amply sufficient to secure relief; nevertheless in156 RETENTION OF URINE. Aspirator in retention. Statistics. Mode of proceeding in a case of retention. ■When ordinary means fail. Puncture of l>iadder per rectum. Its value. exceptional instances, this operation is of great value. It must be remembered, also that the practice is only required when simpler means have failed. Since the introduction of the “ aspirator,” many surgeons have employed it with success in cases of retention, but relief by such a measure does not commend itself to my mind, being merely a tem- porising operation, and requiring frequent repetition in the same case; it has no such influence for good upon the cause of the retention as the operation of puncturing the bladder through the rectum. But in exceptional cases of retention of urine it may be a justifiable proceeding. In the treatment of retention of urine with simple organic or trau- matic stricture, the same principles of practice should be applied as have been recommended in the former class of cases; and in a large proportion of instances it has been already shown that success by such treatment may be secured ; since, out of 137 cases of retention admitted into Guy’s, operative measures were required in only 23, and the simple introduction of a catheter with the aid of warm baths and the internal administration of opium, proved sufficient to carry out all the objects required in 114. If the surgeon is called, therefore, to a case of retention of urine with organic stricture, the introduction of a catheter is the primary means to be employed. If the history iuforms him that the retention is the result of a gradually contracting passage, a medium-sized instrument should be selected, and on this failing, a second attempt with a smaller one may be fol- lowed by success. Force, however, must not to be employed, and too much time should not be expended in making the attempt. If success is to follow the operation, it will readily be obtained; perseverance and repeated endeavours to pass an instrument, as a rule, do harm. If the symptoms are not very urgent and some delay may be allowed, the warm bath and a full opiate, such as two or even three grains of opium maybe employed; and, under their combined influence, it will be only in exceptional cases that relief will not subsequently be secured. If the symptoms of retention, however, are very urgent, and the agonies of the sufferer demand immediate relief; or, if the means which have been just described have been found wanting after a fair trial, there is little doubt that the most scientific and certain practice is the puncturing of the bladder through the rectum; for all expe- rience has correctly endorsed the opinion expressed by Mr. Cock when he recalled the attention of the profession to this operation in his valuable paper published in 1852 (vol. xxxv of the ‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.’), “ that the bladder may be reached with the smallest amount of pain, with the least risk of present or future danger, and with the greatest prospect of ulterior good, by puncture through the rectum.” The records I possess of the cases of this operation, positively prove the truth of this opinion, and it is gratifying to find that, in these days, the majority of surgeons recognise the value of the practice. t . The operation is as simple as it is safe, and as efficient as it is scien- tific. As a means of relieving a patient from the agony of retention of urine which has been proved to be irremediable by the rational use ofTAPPING THE BLADDER. ] 57 catheters, it stands unrivalled. By its adoption all forcible cathe- terism with its dangers is avoided. Perineal section and its diffi- culties as a remedy for retention, are done away with, and the operation for puncturing the bladder above the pubes may nearly be forgotten. Puncturing the bladder through the rectum embodies in itself all the advantages of these means without any of their evils; and on practical grounds commends itself for our adoption. I would add, therefore, as a final conclusion :—“ That in all cases of Conclusion, retention of urine from stricture in which relief cannot be given by means of rational aud not forcible catheterism, and in which the use of the warm bath and opium have failed, the operation of puncturing the bladder through the rectum should be performed.” On Puncture of the Bladder per Rectum. In all cases of retention of urine in which relief cannot be afforded O'1 ll'e ^ f by the introduction of a catheter, and the nature of the obstruction is puncture ot not such as to require the operation of urethrotomy, puncturing the the bladder bladder through the rectum is the right operation to perform, as by it Per rectum- relief can be given with rapidity, certainty, and safety. In former times, the bladder used to be punctured with a full-sized trocar and canula from the perinamm, but such a clumsy operation is not now recognised among surgical proceedings, though with the aspirator, the same proceeding has been often undertaken. At the present day, some surgeons prefer tapping the bladder above the pubes, but in safety and efficiency the operation is not to be compared with that which I now recommend, for, in the words of its modern advocate, Mr. Cock, “The operation is safe, easy of accomplishment, and-without Cock’s danger as to its consequences. In cases of retention which resist remarks, ordinary treatment it is greatly to be preferred to the long-continued attempts at catheterism, which, whether successful or not, must be in- finitely more injurious to the urinary organs than the simple and almost painless operation of tapping.” “ I consider,” writes Cock, “ that the benefit of the operation con- sists, not merely in the immediate relief given to the patient, but also in the opportunity which it affords, by the retention of the canula in the bladder through an indefinite period, of diverting the flow of urine from its ordinary channel, and thus giving quiet, freedom from pain, and the natural means of restoration to the maimed, irritable, or dis- eased urethra. I conceive also that the bladder might be tapped with advantage in cases of obstinate stricture, in which retention of urine does not actually exist.” These views, published by Mr. Cock in 1852, ‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ and ‘ Guy’s Reports,’ 1866, I cordially endorse. The practice of Guy’s Hos- pital for the last twenty years, to my knowledge, has only confirmed their accuracy, and, the more I see of the operation, the more I like it. The objections raised against it are theoretical and not practical, for Objections abscesses between tbe bladder aud rectum, persistent fistulous openings, are injury to the seminal vesicles, and wounds of the peritoneum, do not tlle01'etic,d. commonly occur. They are said to have done so in exceptional instances but such must, indeed, be very rare.

The only requisite is a moderately full bladder, a feature almost always present under the circumstances which call for the operation. An enlarged prostate is no real obstacle to its performance, since it may be perforated with impunity. Mode of The operation. The best instruments are those suggested by Mr. performance. Cock. The long curved trocar and canula as originally employed, are inefficient instruments; indeed, many of the objections to the operation are, probably, traceable to their use. Cock’s instruments consist of a canula, six and a half inches long, a blunt pilot trocar, and a sharp trocar; a second tube, with an expanding end to keep the canula in position ; and a third to maintain the second in position. (Fig. 368.)TAPPING THE BLADDER. 159 upwards to feel for the prostate (Fig. 368), and, if possible, for the bulging base of the tense bladder beyond. Some little pressure above the pubes may help in this attempt. The pulpy point of the index- finger is then to be held in the median line just below the spot at which the puncture is to he made. The surgeon then with his right hand is to take from his assistant the canula, well oiled and fitted with the blunt pilot trocar, and to introduce it into the rectum upon his left index-finger, passing it well up to the point selected for puncture. He should then steady the canula and hold it firmly in position with the thumb and three outer fingers of his left hand, aud withdraw the blunt trocar. The sharp trocar can then be introduced through the canula, and, having reached its end, the handle with the canula is to be depressed and driven home, in a direction upwards and forwards, in a line towards the umbilicus (dotted line, Fig. 368). The bladder in this way will be entered, the free end of the instrument moving freely, and all resistance ceasing. The trocar should then be withdrawn, and the canula pressed well home. Before the bladder is completely emptied, it is well to insert the two inner canulse, and fasten the whole in by means of tapes, two passed in front and two behind the thighs, to a girth round the waist. The canula may then be plugged with a peg to retain the urine, or with a hollow plug inserted into a piece of india-rubber tubing, through which the water may drain away. As soon as the urethral passage has become pervious to the catheter, but not before, the canula should be withdrawn; this condition taking place usually within a week from the introduction of the catheter. The stricture may then he treated on rational principles by dilatation. It is very remarkable how, at times, a stricture which has thus been left alone and unirritated by catheterism or ineffectual natural efforts at micturition, gives way under such treatment, and a thoroughly im- pervious indurated urethra becomes pervious and amenable to simple measures. The wound into the bladder closes rapidly after the removal of the canula, even after many weeks; and, in a case of my own no urinary fistula followed the presence of the canula for seven weeks. In retention of urine from enlarged prostate such an operation as this is rarely called for; yet at times it is necessary. I have had Sometimes recourse to it on three occasions where the neck of the bladder and required for prostate gland had been seriously injured from rough catheterism, and cnla^‘:'1 with such good success that I shall never hesitate to repeat it when any difficulty exists in entering the bladder, or, in subsequently keeping an instrument in the bladder. In two of the cases mentioned, the irritability of the bladder was so great as to resent the presence of an instrument, and the pain and difficulty in its passage were so severe as to be nearly unendurable. In both these cases the operation was fol- lowed by speedy and permanent relief. The bladder recovered its healthy condition after the parts had had rest for a few days, the urethra allowing of catheterism without distress, and convalescence was soon established. The surgeon, then, may perform this operation without fear in all cases of retention where any difficulty in catheterism exists. I know of no operation attended with equal good, that is so safe, satisfactory, or free from danger. In all cases of supposed retention of urine, the surgeon should guard160 AFFECTIONS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS.

Extravasation of Urine in Children and Retention from Impacted Urethral Calculus. Impacted urethral calculus. Extravasa- It has been already explained how retention and extravasation of urine in the adult may be produced by the mechanical obstruction of a urethral stricture. It remains to show how, in children, the same effects ensue from a mechanical obstruction of a very different kind. I allude to the obstruction caused by a urethral calculus. A vesical calculus when small and ejected from the bladder may become lodged or impacted in any portion of the urethra, and, as a consequence, give rise to every degree of difficulty of micturition, even to a retention of urine and extravasation. And although in adult life I have seen complete retention, I have never seen extravasation occur as a result of impacted urethral calculus. In infancy and childhood, however, almost all the examples of extravasation of urine that have passed under my observation have been the product of such a cause; I have seen it in an infant fourteen months old, and in many others older. When a case of retention in a child comes under notice, and there is no phimosis, paraphimosis, or adherent prepuce by which this symptom may be produced, a strong probability exists that a urethral calculus is the cause. Indeed extravasation of urine in childhood is almost inva- riably the result of an impacted calculus, the impaction commonly taking place in the perinseum, the stone rarely passing into the penis. Treatment.—If the calculus can be removed by forceps carefully used, this practice is the right one to adopt; it is, however, rarely successful, and, where these means fail, the stone must be excised. When extravasation has taken place, the urethra must be opened in the perinmum by a free incision upon a grooved staff. The stone is sometimes lost in the sloughing tissues. By way of summary of the causes of retention it may be stated that to the causes retention in a male child is usually due to a urethral calculus, phimosis, of retention. paraphimosis, adherent prepuce, or the mechanical obstruction caused by a piece of string, &c.

There is probably no part of the body which varies more in its con- formation than the penis, or one in which any congenital defect is more likely to be inherited. The elongated and contracted prepuce isPHIMOSIS. 161 particularly hereditary, and all the male branches of a family may be the subjects of it. I have known this to he the case in many instances, and, in one family, five sons suffered from it, as well as their father. Phimosis, or a condition of prepuce which, either from narrowness Phimosis, of the preputial orifice, or adhesion, cannot be retracted behind the glans, is, therefore, a congenital affection, but as often as not an ac- quired one—the result of inflammatory thickening and contraction subsequent to a preputial chancre, or other affection. So long as the prepuce is only long and the glans can be uncovered for purposes of cleanliness, and during erection, operative interference is not called for, though it is well to impress upon nurses the necessity of paying attention to the infant’s penis, and of cleaning it daily; since a want of such attention is frequently the source of urinary trouble and penile irritation. When neglected, the secretion of Tyson’s glands collects behind the corona, and acts as an irritant; the prepuce and glans penis constantly becoming adherent, and setting up bladder irritation simulating the symptoms of stone {vide page 149). In some neglected cases, an acute inflammation is induced, followed by cedeina inflamma- of the prepuce and the secretion of pus, which suspicious minds have tory too often interpreted as gonorrhoea, much to the injury of nursemaids Pllimosis- and others in whose charge the child rested. This disease is essentially a balanitis, and easily cured by cleanliness. In the adult, a long and narrow prepuce is injurious, as being a bar to proper cleanliness, and interfering with coitus or rendering it painful. It is also probably an exciting cause of cancer of the organ, where a disposition to such an affection exists. In boyhood, it probably by setting up an irritation in the parts induces a habit which ends in masturba- tion. It often gives rise, moreover, to incontinence and may produce retention of urine. Dr Lewis Sayre, of New York, has also pointed out in his work on ‘ Orthopedic Surgery,’ 1876, that as a direct result of this condition of the prepuce, talipes, paralysis, and other ner- vous affections may take place, the talipes being due to muscular contraction of the lower extremities owing to reflex nerve irri- tation ; and paralysis, as a consequence of nervous exhaustion caused by the undue genital excitement which is often associated with this condition. Tbeatment.—When the narrowing is not great, the daily retraction of the prepuce over the glans for purposes of cleanliness is gene- rally sufficient to dilate the orifice, care being taken to replace it subsequently. Dr. Cruise’s plan of dilating the orifice mechanically is not satisfactory; I have given it a trial and rejected it. The suggestion also of making two partial lateral sections of the mucous membrane has in my hands met with the same fate. Neither of these methods is so successful as to warrant its being recommended. When phimosis exists, congenital or otherwise, it is, as a rule, best VOL. ii. "i i162 PHIMOSIS. treated by circumcision. In exceptional cases, where a narrowing of the prepuce is more marked than an elongation, the prepuce may be slit up (Fig. 369), but in children circumcision is the better operation. In some instances, however, where the penis is very short, the fault resting more in the penis itself than its skin covering, circumcision should not be performed, for I have known, under these circumstances, the operation to fail, even when well done j in such cases the prepuce should rather be slit up to the corona and its mucous covering turned well back and fixed to the skin. Slitting plan. In minor cases thz slitting plan should be carried out; the skin and its mucous lining being divided in the middle line either by the intro- duction of a bistoury guided by a director beneath the prepuce, or by means of a pair of sharp scissors. The surgeon must be careful in doing this, to divide the mucous membrane right hack to the corona. In the adult he should then turn the two flaps backwards, and fasten the mucous to the skin flap by means of some fine sutures. In the infant there is no necessity to stitch. When the prepuce requires divi- sion to expose a sore or some warty growth, the above plan should be selected. Circumcision Circumcision, is an operation that requires great nicety, for it fails if sufficient skin is not taken away and the mucous covering of the glans is not fully divided up to the corona, and it does not turn out well when too much skin is removed. The following is the plan I have for years adopted and taught, and have never known to fail if properly carried out:— Mode of The first point is to decide how much skin is to be removed, operating. which can satisfactorily be determined by applying a pair of long dressing forceps to the penis, which should be allowed to rest in its natural position, on a level with its corona, and closing them as soon as the glans penis has been allowed to slip backward. The integu- ment in front of the forceps may then be amputated with a scalpel (Fig. 370.) The forceps should now be taken away and the mucous covering of the glans be divided in the middle line, well up to the corona (as in the slitting operation) and turned backwards, the two flaps being stitched to the skin by fine su- tures. In adults, a fine uninterrupted suture is probably the best; in in- fants, a strip of dry lint wrapped round the parts is all that is necessary. The glans penis in both these operations should be completely sepa- rated from its mucous covering, all secretion removed, and the fraenum divided when short. Tig. 370.163 PARAPHIMOSIS. By adopting these suggestions the student has a definite guide to aid him in the removal of the skin; whereas if the end of the fore- skin be drawn out as usually recommended, he has none. Paraphimosis is said to exist when a tight prepuce which has been Paraphi- retracted behind the glans cannot be replaced, and as a consequence a nlos*s- strangulation of the glans, and mucous lining of the prepuce with oedema takes place, and at a later period ulceration in the line of stran- gulation, and even sloughing. In children, it follows the accidental retraction of a narrow prepuce, and in adults, the mechanical retraction of the prepuce during coitus, and the neglect to reduce it. It may be associated or not with some venereal complication. Treatment.—The object of the surgeon should be to reduce the Treatment, glans behind the narrow prepuce by which it is strangulated; and, failing this by simple means, he must divide the constricting preputial orifice so as to effect this end. To carry out the first object, which can be done, as a rule, in recent cases both in children and adults before the oedema is great, chloro- form should be given and the patient placed on' his back. The surgeon should then take the penis between the index and the middle Mode of fingers of his two interlocked hands, and while thus pulling the pre- reduction, puce forwards forcibly press the glans backwards with his two thumbs, the pressure of the thumbs, and counter-pressure with traction of the interlocked fingers so displacing the fluid from the oedematous tissues as to allow of the reduction of the paraphimosis. When the oedema is very great, a few needle or lancet punctures facilitate the opera- tion. Au india-rubher band applied as an Esmarch’s bandage will sometimes answer. When the affection has been of some days’ stand- ing and ulceration exists, and, when failure has followed all attempts Fig. 371.

This is best done bv a cut, half an inch long made with a scalpel in a vertical direction over164 AMPUTATION OF THE PENIS. Warty growths. Treatment. Cancer of penis. Treatment. Removal by galvanic cautery. the constriction, the thumb of the left hand forcibly depressing the glans penis. (Fig. 371.) The prepuce at times yields audibly and the wound gapes ; the whole constricting medium should also be divided. Water dressing, or, some lead lotion should be applied to the parts subsequently to assist recovery. After the paraphimosis has been reduced and the cedema subsided, it is wise in the ease of children to circumcise, and in the adult the same practice is frequently desirable. In all cases of oedema of the penis in children, the surgeon must remember, that it may be due to mechanical strangulation by string. Warty growths are very common on the penis, and they may be found fringing the orifice of the prepuce, and the urethra, or growing from any part of the mucous membrane between these two points; indeed, they may grow from within the urethra as well as from the outside shin of the prepuce. They have in the bulk of cases, a venereal origin, that is, they have been caught by contagion, for warts are contagious; but they, at times, occur without any such cause in men who have long prepuces, and who are not sufficiently careful in local cleanliness. When they are numerous, their excision is the only suc- cessful treatment, nitrate of silver being applied to their bases, but in less severe examples, the dry oxide of zinc, freshly powdered savine and calomel, are good local applications, the warts rapidly withering under their influence. Cancer of the Penis. In the middle-aged and old, it is sometimes difficult if not impos- sible, to distinguish simple warty from cancerous growths; although the greater obstinacy of the cancerous and their disposition to bleed are probably the best points of distinction. When there is ulceration the disease is probably cancer. If the cancer be left to take its course, the glans penis and prepuce become infil- trated and the warts discharges fetid ichorous secretion, break down and ulcerate; the inguinal glands become involved, and death takes place from exhaustion. At times the whole organ is destroyed and the scrotum involved. Cancer of the penis is generally of the epithelial variety, true carci- noma being comparatively rare. Treatment.—In all clear cases of this disease, unless the inguinal or lumbar glands are extensively involved, amputation is the only sound practice to follow, and, in the doubtful, it is the wisest. When the prepuce alone is involved, the excision of the growth may be sufficient, but nothing less than amputation is of any use when the glans is affected. Under all circumstances, the surgeon should cut quite free of the disease, for the tissues about it are probably more or less infiltrated with cancerous products. I have a patient alive and well now (1878), whose penis I cut off for cancer eleven years ago, and a second, from whom I excised a cancerous mass from the prepuce, twelve years ago. Amputation of the Penis. Since the galvanic cautery has been in use, I have employed nothing else for amputation of the penis. The platinum wire should be passed round the penis and made tight with the ecraseur screw. Connection with the battery must then be made, and the wire screwed slowlyINJURIES OF THE PENIS. 365 Fig. 372. home, for, if the tissues are divided too rapidly, haemorrhage will take place. The heat should not be too intense. Under ordinary circum- stances, the operation is absolutely bloodless, and the subsequent pain slight. After the penis has been removed, it is wise to slit the urethra open for about half an inch, turn its two edges outwards, and fasten them with sutures. This step may be done at the time of the operation or during the first week, and is necessary to prevent the con- traction of the urethral orifice that may otherwise ensue. When the cautery is not to be had, the knife should be used, and the old opera- Amputation tiou consisted in the removal of the organ by one clean sweep of the wlttl bistoury, an assistant having steadied and compressed the base of the organ by a band of tape. The modern im- proved operation, which, I believe, was sug- gested by Hilton, consists in the introduc- tion of a narrow bistoury between the spongy and cavernous bodies, and after dividing the latter, the spongy body with the urethra must be cut through about half an inch more forward. The object of this is to make the urethra stand out from the stunted organ, and thus facilitate mic- turition. It is without doubt the best mode of amputating a penis with the knife. To prevent any tendency in the urethra to contract, it may be slit open or stitched back to the preputial skin. Fig. 372 illustrates the stump after such an ampu- tation.

It is not uncommonly the subject of the prepuce, what has been described as elephantiasis, although when the penis is Hypertrophy involved, the scrotum is usually similarly affected. I have, however, of prepuce, seen one case in a man aged thirty-five, where the penis was thus alone affected. The organ was immense, and frightful to look at. When in repose, it measured eight inches round and six long. The man came to me with a gonorrhoea; admitting, however, that he had never been able to have true coitus since the disease had existed, which was about four or five years. The disease is a chronic hypertrophy of the skin and cellular tissues. Nothing hut the excision of the redundant integument is beneficial. Stump of penis after operation. Injuries to Penis.

Thus some years ago, I was consulted by a gentleman whose penis, when turgid, arched laterally, the cavernous body of one side having atrophied and become a mere gristly mass. This condition had followed an injury received in coitus many years before. Some great induration had existed for months in the cavernous body that had subsequently atrophied. More recently, I have seen a married man, about 60, who a year before “ missed his mark ” in coitus, and hurt his penis; an induration fol- lowed, and at the present time where this existed there is a deficiency of tissue, and when the penis becomes turgid it is never straight, but bent laterally. A singular case of injury to the penis was seen at Guy’s in 1867 in • the practice of Mr. Hilton. It was in a man aet. 50, who when nineteen, had had his penis bitten by a stallion; after the accident some little bleeding occurred, and a fleshy cylindrical body, an inch and a quarter long and one third of an inch in dia- meter, projected from the urethral orifice. It was evi- dently the corpus spongiosum which had been divided by the horse behind the glans penis and had become everted. When the patient was admitted, the corpus spongiosum urethrae terminated abruptly about one inch behind the glans penis, and the urine flowed by the side of the protrusion. (Fig. 373.) Malformations of the Urino-genital Organs. These malformations of the urino-genital organs are more common in the male than in the female subject, and show themselves in many degrees of severity. Thus, when the upper surface of the urinary passage from the orifice of the urethra to the fuudus of the bladder is deficient, a case of extroversion of the bladder or ectopion vesica is said to exist; when the urethra alone is deficient at its upper part, epis- padias is the term employed. Some authors apply the latter also to the more complete condition. With this imperfect condition, a sepa- ration of the pubic bones frequently exists, as well as some malforma- tion of the scrotum, this sac being often bifid though containing the testicles in proper position. At times a hernia complicates the case. When no testes are present and the scrotum is bifid, the question as to sex often arises, for in the female the vagina is frequently absent, or so small as more nearly to represent a urethra than a vagina. In extroversion of the bladder, the posterior wall of the bladder appears as a red mucous mass below the umbilicus which is lost in the upper border of the deformity. At the lower part of its surface, the orifices of the ureters may be often seen as small nipple-like projec- tions; and in some instances, these orifices are lost in the pelvic chink, although they may be brought into view by depressing the fissured penis or what represents the penis, for this will probably appear only Fig. 373. Corpus spongiosum projecting from urethra after injury.167 AFFECTIONS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS as an expanded glans penis and a pendulous prepuce. The cleft urethra, as it becomes lost in the pelvic fissure, can be made visible by pulling the parts down. (Fig. 374.) In the female subject, the exposed urethra will be seen between the two labia. When the vagina is present, it will open at its upper border, and appear continuous with the lower labia. (Fig. 3/5.) At times, though very rarely, the epispadias involves only the urethra. I have seen but five cases of this peculiarity, and in all the exposed mucous surface of the urethra passed backwards towards the pubes into a fissure, which was covered in by a thin transverse fold of skin, from Fro. 374. 375- beneath which, urine flowed. The scrotum was large but bifid, and contained the testes (* Guy’s Hosp. Rep.,’ 1868). Treatment.—The chief annoyance connected with this deformity Treatment, being due to the constant dribbling of the urine, Messrs. Simon and Lloyd were induced to carry out an ingenious operation by which the urine might be carried into the rectum and the fissure subsequently closed, but the attempt failed and has not been re- peated. For particulars the reader may refer to the * Lancet ’ (1851 and 1852). Holmes has suggested a modification of Simon’s plan, and it is probably in this direction that some good may even- tually he found. In a case of epispadias, in a boy, recently under my care (Sept., 1875), in which the whole of the urethra down to the neck of the bladder was fissured, and in which consequently there was incontinence of urine, I tapped the urethra in the perineum in front of the prostate, and established an artificial urethral opening. By these means the urine passed through the perineum instead of above the pubes, and con- sequently could be caught and retained in a urinal, greatly to the patient’s comfort. Other surgeons, however, have devised means by which the exposed mucous covering of the bladder may be covered in, thereby adding to the comfort of the patient; and of these Wood, of King’s College, has been the most successful. He has operated in ten such cases. I Eclopion vesicle in mule. in female.MALFORMATIONS OF PENIS. 168 Hypospadias. Treatment. and Holmes in five. I have operated only in two. Pour of Wood’s suc- ceeded completely; three of Holmes’s; and one of mine, the others being partially successful. The operation consists in bringing up flaps of skin from either side of the fissure and covering it in, fastening them together by sutures. For full details, vide ‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. lii, and Holmes’s ‘ Surg. Dis. of Child.,’ 1868. In one case I destroyed the mucous membrane with the cautery, and thus turned it into a cicatrix, avoiding the ureters. Hypospadias is a term applied to any deficiency of the under surface of the urethra, and in the larger number of cases, the urethral orifice is placed below the glans at a spot corresponding to the preputial frsenum. In some, a depression exists in the glans penis corresponding to the natural outlet with several small depressions between the urethral orifice and the cup-like depression at the extremity of the glans; while in others, one or more foramina are present, situated below the true opening of the urethra through which urine escapes. The urethral opening in these cases is often small and re- quires enlarging. In more extreme cases the urethral orifice appears at the base of the penis, when the deformity is commonly associated with a bifid scrotum; under these circumstances, when the testes are absent, the question of sex is raised. In a case of this kind that I saw in 1867, the sexual passion was so strong that the man came to me to ask for cas- tration, as he was unable to copulate on account of the stunted con- dition of his penis, and the way in which it was held down by a band which caused it to arch downwards under excitement. The man at the time had testitis from ungratified passion. The operative measures that have been employed for the relief of this deformity have hitherto not been very successful, although re- cently (‘Med. Times and Gaz.,’ Jan. 30,1875) Fig. 376. Mr. John Wood has recorded two cases of the balanic or penian varieties in which relief was given, and M. Duplay has pub- lished full details of his method of dealing with the more advanced form of malforma- tion, called the perineo-scrotal (Paris, 1874), Pig. 376, A. I think so well of Duplay’s operation that I will describe it. It has for its object, first, to separate the penis from the scrotum and destroy its arching, in order to allow erection and coi- tion ; and, secondly, to construct a new urethra from the abnormal perineal opening to the glans penis. To carry out the first indication, a free division of the fibrous bands connecting the Periueo-scrotal hypospadias, penis with the scrotum has to be made; and when this can be effected by a subcutaneous wound as adopted by Bouisson, so much the better. Duplay, however, incises transversely the tissues from without inwards, dividing, if necessary, the envelopes and septum of the corpora cavernosa; this incision leaves a lozenge-shaped wound (Pig. 376, b), the edges of which may be brought together by sutures (Fig- 376, c). After this169 MALFORMATIONS OF PENIS. operation, the penis is to be kept constantly stretched to guard against subsequent retraction, and six months later, the second part of the operation should be carried out. The construction of a new urethra is a difficult matter, and must be carried out in stages. Duplay’s method is divided into three.—1st. The restoration of the urinary meatus ; 2nd, the creation of the new urethra from the meatus down to the hypospadic perineal opening; and 3rd, the reunion of the two portions of the urethra. The first stage may be done at the same time as the correction of Duplay’s the arching of the penis, and consists in simply paring the edges of operation, the glans penis and bringing them together by sutures round a catheter (Fig. 376, c). It is almost always successful. The second stage is to be ef- fected in the following manner:— The penis being held up, two longitudinal incisions are made on its inferior surface parallel to the median line, and extending from the glans penis to the peri- neal urethral opening, these inci- sions being bounded by two trans- verse ones (Fig. 376, d). Two I quadrilateral flaps are thus formed (a b, a' b'), which should be large enough when turned back to cover a catheter that has been previ- ously introduced into the urethra. The cutaneous surface of these flaps should next be turned to- wards the catheter and the raw surface exposed to view. The skin of the penis in con- tinuation of the transverse inci- sions is then by a little dissec- tion made to furnish two new flaps (c d, c' d’) for covering the raw exposed surface of the first flaps. « Lastly, the lower edge of the glans penis is vivified in the part which corresponds to the new channel. The flaps must now be united, their superior edges being stitched to the vivified glans and the two flaps on each side of the urethra, the superficial and deep, brought together with metallic or other sutures. (Fig. 376, e.) The third stage of the operation consists in the reunion of the two portions of urethra, and should be effected by paring the edges of the hypospadic orifice and bringing them together by sutures 'deep and superficial. After the operation the urine must be drawn off by means of a catheter, and the union of the parts is usually completed after three or four days. Fig. 376.

Puberty is the best period probably for the performance of this operation. Occlusion of the urethra from some membrane or band sometimes exists, which if not broken down in intra-uterine life leads to dilatation of the bladder, sacculation of the ureters, distension of the pelvis of the kidney, and destruction of its secreting structure (vide cases by Morris ‘ Med. Chir. Trans.,’ 1876). ON LOCAL VENEREAL DISEASE. Urethritis, gonorrhoea, or clap, are terms applied to cases of inflam- mation of the urethra of every degree of intensity, and the product of a great variety of causes. In some, the affection is the consequence of the direct irritation of an instrument passed into or left in the urethra, while in others, it follows excessive sexual intercourse, or ordinary sexual intercourse with chaste or unchaste women who are out of health and suffering from acridity of the vaginal secretion. It is the direct pro- duct most commonly of contagion from the specific or other pus of an inflamed mucous membrane, Simon (‘ Holmes’s System,’ vol. i) having shown that “ there is ample room to question the popular impression that only specific inflammations are communicable; much reason for suspecting it, on the contrary, to be a generic and essential property of inflammation, that its actions are always in their kind, to some extent, contagious, pus from an acute inflammation producing its kind on inoculation.” Lee states (‘ Holmes’s System,’ vol. v, ed. 2) the causes of urethritis to be the application of a gonorrhoeal discharge to the sexual organs. Certain irritating substances applied to the mucous membranes, e.g. menstrual fluid, leucorrhceal discharges, &c., and other irritants, such as the injection of a solution of ammonia, and some constitutional cause, such as gout or rheumatism. It is well to bear in mind also Ricord’s observation, “ that gonorrhoea often arises from intercourse with women who themselves have not the diseaseand Diday’s, “ that from the very fact of a woman having a discharge, no matter what its origin, she is liable to give a discharge to a man. Complaints closely resembling gonorrhoea sometimes appear in persons the subjects of stricture, after sexual intercourse, a debauch, or other excitement. The disease may be acute and come on within a few hours of connec- tion, or, it may fail to show itself for five or ten days, and, in a general way, the sooner the symptoms appear after the contagion the acuter the disease. It may be subacute or chronic. It generally commences by an itching about tbe orifice of the urethra, the mucous membrane of which will probably appear swollen and in- jected ; there will be the sensation of heat on micturition, and, after the lapse of a few hours, some muco-purulent fluid will be squeezed out of the urethra. In acute diseases, the urethral discharge will soon become abun- dant, and yellow, green, or blood-stained pus will flow from a highly injected and swollen urethra; the whole glans and penis will become red, swollen, and painful; micturition will also probably be difficult, painful, and scalding, the passage being obstructed by the swelling of the mucous membrane. Chordee, or painful erections, as the disease ad- vances, will appear, and later on perineal pain, if not suppuration. The groins, testicles, and perineum, too, become the seat of more or less ten-GONORRHOEA. 171 derness ; and constitutional symptoms show themselves varying with the degree of the inflammatory action, in some subjects the febrile condi- tion being well marked, but in most absent. After the lapse of ten or fourteen days these acute symptoms partially subside, the discharge Chronic, becomes thinner and more muco-purulent, the external signs of in- flammation less marked, the pain on micturition less severe ; the perineal, inguinal, or scrotal pain probably will have disappeared, and a thin muco-purulent urethral discharge with a slight sensation of heat on micturition alone remaining. When these symptoms are allowed unchecked to run their course they will gradually pass into the condition known as that of gleet, Gleet, in which a thin muco-purulent urethral discharge exists, unattended by any local or general source of pain. Gleet, however, may be the result of some stricture or local urethral disease, such as an ulcer. The ordinary seat of the affection is the mucous membrane of the Seat ot urethra, the orifices of the lacunte being chiefly involved. The fossa disease navicularis and parts around, and the mucous membrane of the bulb are the most common seats; the dissections of Sir A. Cooper, Ricord, Thompson, and others, having proved this. At times, however, gonor- rhoeal inflammation may, as Wallace pointed out (‘ On Venereal Dis- ease’), involve at the same time the whole of the urethra, the bladder, the testicles, the glans, and the prepuce, in the male; and in the female, the nymphse, clitoris, vagina, &c., the disease, as it creeps along to the posterior part of the urinary passage, decreasing in intensity in the anterior. In severe cases the inflammation may extend to the sub- mucous tissue, and run on to thickening, and even to suppuration. Urethritis, the result of some mechanical irritation of the urethra, • is rarely acute, and it, as a rule, subsides as soon as the cause has been removed. Urethritis, the consequence of some gonorrhoeal contagion, is almost always acute, and having once been started is not readily arrested. Gleet, whether the consequence of an acute or subacute inflammation, when of some standing, is almost always due to some urethral con- traction or stricture. In the female, gonorrhoea is to be recognised as a yellow purulent Gonorrhoea vaginal discharge accompanied by heat, pain, and signs of acute in- in ttlc female, flammation. The less purulent it is, and the more the discharge is made up of mucus and epithelium scales, the greater is the probability of the disease being due to vaginal irritation other than gonorrhoeal, that is, to leucorrhcea; and, when the discharge is made up of masses of glutinous, semi-transparent, albuminoid material like the white of egg, the more certain is it that the discharge is uterine and comes from the glands in the neck of the uterus. It must be remembered, however, that in both sexes, as long as any purulent or semi-purulent fluid is poured out by the mucous membrane of the genital passage (even the slightest gleet), violent urethritis, or inflammation of the vagina, may arise in another subject by contagion, aud there is good reason to believe, that sexual excitement is an impor- tant element in aiding the propagation by contagion. Mr. J. Morgan of Dublin believes, that the vaginal discharges of constitutionally In- fected women are the cause of the majority of sores in men. Treatment.—Gonorrhoea or urethritis is a local disease and may be Treatment, treated locally with success. When it is the result of local irritationGONORRHCEA. 172 Salines. Copaiba. Sandal wood. Strong injections condemned. In chronic stage. On injections. from the passage of an instrument, no treatment is called for, the discharge ceasing naturally as soon as its cause has been removed, but when from gonorrhoeal contagion, such a result is not met with. In a very acute clap when the urethra and penis are swollen from vascular turgescence, free purgation with salines is the best practice, and, in plethoric patients, the addition of antimony in quarter-grain doses to excite nausea is most valuable. In less severe cases, copaiba may be given in doses of twenty drops or half a drachm three times a day with advantage, but this drug should not be continued for more than three days. If it is to do good it will show its influence within that time, and a longer continuance of the drug is useless and deleterious. The yellow oil of sandal wood may also be employed in the same dose and under like circumstances, and at times, it acts most beneficially even when the copaiba has failed, but is iu no way certain in its action. Astringent injections are always of value when they can be used frequently and efficiently, but strong injections are to be condemned. They may cure the disease suddenly, hut more commonly they fail, and set up inflammation of the bladder and other mischief, by adding to the irritation. The best injection in all stages of the disease is tannin in the pro- portion of three to six grains to the ounce, and next to this is alum in the proportion of two or three grains to the ounce, or the chloride of zinc, one grain to the ounce. A solution of salicylic acid is also good, 5ss of the acid being dissolved in six ounces of water with a scruple of borax. To be of use injections should be used from four to six times in the twenty-four hours. An ordinary glass syringe will answer every purpose if the glans penis he well held, but there are special syringes which are supposed to have some advantages. During this treatment, the use of such alkalies as the citrate or tartrate of potash in twenty-grain doses, or ten grains of the bicarbonate may be given, good food being allowed, but little or no stimulant. In the chronic stage, 1 have found great benefit from the introduc- tion into the urethra of a large catheter covered with the glycerine of tannic acid; and, at times, the Suppositorium Acidi Tannici rolled into sticks and passed into the urethra, acts most beneficially. The best way to give copaiba is as a bolus mixed with calcined magnesia, and wrapped in wafer paper, or, as a mixture with gum and peppermint water. The capsules are uncertain in their action. Copaiba is well known to produce in some patients a severe rose urti- carious eruption. Cubebs are less to be relied on than copaiba. In using injections, the object is to make an impression upon the mucous membrane by their astringent effects, and to keep it up. Weak astringents frequently employed are far more valuable than strong used at longer intervals. When so used they are as useful in gonorrhoeal inflammations of the urethra as in that of the eye. When a man can devote himself to the cure of his clap, and throw into his urethra a weak astringent every hour, he will often check it within two or three days, in the same way as a gonorrhoeal inflammation of the eye may be controlled under similar treatment. The nitrate of silver injection is an uncertain, and, at times, a dangerous remedy, adding often to the disease instead of diminishing it. In all cases of long-continued clap or gleet in the male, the presence of a stricture173 GONORRHCEA. should be suspected. It may often be made out by the passage of a Bougie, full sized bougie a boule, when an ordinary catheter fails to detect it. The gleet should only be satisfactorily treated by the cure of the stric- ture, that is, its full dilatation. Tonics, particularly iron, are valuable adjuncts to the treatment. Tonics. All connection must be forbidden for some time after the apparent cure of a clap, for any sexual excitement is likely to be followed by a relapse. Drinking and smoking to excess are injurious. In women, a clap is readily cured by the frequent use of astrin- Treatment in gent injections of tannin, alum, or zinc, 5ss to a pint; the passage the female, into the upper part of the vagina of the tannic acid suppository is also excellent treatment. In the use of both these means the patient should lie down with her hips raised, and the astringent should be allowed to remain in the passage. To inject it sitting or standing is a useless, although too common a practice. Complications.—In male subjects, inflammation of the epididymis is Complica- the most common complication, the disease, doubtless, spreading in a tions. direct way from the urethra through the vas deferens and cord to the epididymis. In some cases, it stops at the cord; in others, it goes on Epididymitis, to affect the testicle itself. It is often associated with hydrocele, and from this fact some surgeons have been led to believe, that inflam- mation of the testicle itself is a common consequence of a clap. The treatment of this affection will be considered in a future page. In the female, inflammation of the ovary is said to occur, and even pelvic peritonitis. Abscesses in the cellular tissue external to the urethra, penile or Abscess, perineal, are often met with in acute gonorrhoea and should be opened early. Chordee, or painful erection caused by the stretching of the corpora Chordee. cavernosa into which inflammatory products have been infiltrated is a common consequence, and a very painful one. Full doses of opium (gr. j), or ten grains of henbane, and a like dose of camphor, are reliable remedies. Ricord used a suppository of ten grains of camphor and one grain of the extract of opium; I have sometimes thought, the morphia suppository the most useful. Belladonna also smeared over the urethra gives relief at times. Retention of urine may likewise occur from the mechanical closure Retention of of the urethra through its swelling, from spasm of the urethra, or urine- from both causes. The warm bath and opium are the best remedies for the complication, a catheter being passed only when an absolute necessity exists. Inflammation of the prostate is likewise a complication, as is also Inflamma- jnjlammation of the bladder.

In neglected cases these glands may suppurate. Fomentations and tonics are the necessary treatment. The absorbents of the penis are at times inflamed and suppurate. Balanitis.—When the glans penis and prepuce are involved in the Balanitis, inflammation, and this inflammation is attended yvith profuse discharge, balanitis or external gonorrhoea is said to be present. This affection may be due to want of cleanliness as much as to gonorrhoeal contact.174 HERPES PREPUTIALIS. May be syphilitic. Warts. Treatment of warts. Gonorrhoeal rheumatism. Generally in chronic stage of gonorrhoea. Parts liable to attack. Treatment of rheumatism. Herpes preputialis. When the prepuce becomes cedematous and is long, phimosis takes place; when narrow and retracted behind the glands so as to be irreducible, •paraphimosis. This balanitis should he treated locally by astringents, such as the acetate of lead or the nitrate of silver lotion, v—vj grs. to the ounce, painted on the inflamed part, the phimosis and paraphimosis being treated on general principles. It should be remembered too that a balanitis associated with a rawness or erosion of the glans or prepuce may be due to a syphi- litic inoculation. As a consequence of balanitis, warts are very common which may cover the mucous membrane of the glans and prepuce, or invade the urethra itself. They may grow to a great size, putting on much the appearance of a cancerous penis. I have seen them perforate the prepuce of a penis when phimosis was present. They can only be treated by removal. When extensive, their excision is the best plan, the operation being performed with the patient ansestheticised, the nitrate of silver or perchloride of iron, or the gal- vanic cautery being freely applied to the base of the warty growths. In less severe cases, the warts will often wither if kept dry with the oxide of zinc or the fresh powder of savin. All warts are not, however, gonorrhoeal, but may arise without any such cause even in clean subjects. They are, nevertheless, contagious. In women, they are often found up the vagina, but more frequently at its orifice. Gonorrhoeal rheumatism so called, is an undoubted complication of the disease, explain it as we may. At the end of an attack of clap patients without doubt are often attacked with severe pain and tender- ness of one or more joints, attended with effusion and constitutional disturbance. It may occur with every fresh attack of clap, and I have recorded a case in my hook on the joints, in which it recurred sixteen times after sixteen different attacks of gonorrhoea. Some authors look upon this affection as a species of pyaemia due to the absorption of some morbid matter from the inflamed urethra, hut evidence is still wanting to prove the truth of the theory. It rarely appears during the acute stage of the affection, mostly in the chronic, but arrest of the dis- charge cannot he associated with its appearance. The knees and ankles are the joints mostly involved, yet those of the upper extremities are so at times. The fair-haired and what are called strumous subjects are said to he more prone to the disease, but I cannot say I have observed this. At times the rheumatic pains are more confined to the tendons and muscles; the heels and soles of the feet are also frequent seats. The late Dr. Babington used to say that this form was found only in those who had taken copaiba. Treatment.—In the acute stage, fomentations locally, with or with- out poppy-head decoction, or the extract of opium and the internal use of Dover’s powder, with alkalies, are the best means to adopt. In the more chronic stage the iodide and bromide of potassium with opium appear to have some influence over the disease. It is, however, at all times obstinate. Herpes preputialis. This is a simple affection, which maybe mistaken for chancre,and is175 CHANCRE. known by the appearance of a crop of vesicles around the corona of the glans, or upon the external or internal surface of the prepuce. It is generally attended by much local irritation and local evidence of inflammation, the vesicles when they burst often discharging freely. The affection runs its course in a few days, when the parts heal. A zinc lotion of three or four grains to the ounce expedites recovery, or, a solution of nitrate of silver gr. v to the ounce. The number of vesicles and their grouping is generally sufficient to enable the surgeon to diagnose this affection from a venereal disease. Chancre may be defined to be a sore the result of venereal contact, and On chancre, in a general way, is found upon the penis of the male and genitals Definition, of the female, but it may be seen upon other parts of the body, such as the pubes, thighs, lips, tongue, nipples, fingers, &c. &c., in fact wherever the secretion from a syphilitic subject may be applied to a raw surface. In by far the larger number of cases, this disease begins and ends as Generally a local affection; in a smaller it is a local inoculation of a constitu- local. tional disease, and is followed by syphilis. The sore is not syphilis, although it is the direct means of communicating syphilis, no more than the inoculation of smallpox is smallpox, although the inoculation may be the means of giving smallpox. So long as the disease is local it is comparatively unimportant, When local is however extensive and troublesome it may be in healing. But when- usually i ever it is the local inoculation of a constitutional affection such as ummP01t!UI'- syphilis, it is of grave importance, however apparently trivial may be the local sore. It becomes, therefore, a vital question to make out from the local Is a sore a appearances and conditions of the sore, whether it is likely to prove a' constitutional local disease only, or to be followed by constitutional symptoms, and 0ue ? to a certain extent this diagnosis may be made; that is, a surgeon may Karly from the external appearance of a chancre go so far as to say that in diagnosis all probability, this one will not be followed by syphilis, and that one di®cult- will; but he can do no more, as to dogmatise upon the point and to speak with certainty is beyond his power. The chancre which will not in all probability be followed by The soft and syphilis is the soft suppurating sore. The chancre that will in all the hard sore, probability be followed by syphilis is the hard non-suppurating sore. John Hunter thus described the indurated chancre:—“ The sore is Hunter’s somewhat of a circular form, excavated, without granulations, with chancre, matter adhering to the surface, and with a thickened edge and base. The hardness and thickening are very circumscribed, not diffusing themselves gradually and imperceptibly into the surrounding parts, but terminating abruptly.” In this description we read the type of the hard infecting chancre, the chancre of the inoculation of syphilis wherever found. Hunter adds, however, that “a chancre has com- monly a thickened base; and, although the common inflammation spreads much further, yet the specific inflammation is confined to this Hard chancre base.” An infecting chancre may, too, appear only as a crack, ex- not generally coriation, or indurated tubercle, without abrasion, attended with a suppurating bubo.176 CHANCRE. Soft chancre. Generally with a suppurating bubo. Lee’s observations. The three forms of syphilitic sore. Conclusion. Fringing sores. This form of chancre is commonly associated with some induration not suppuration of the first row of the inguinal glands, the multiple indolent bubo. Its secretion consists of epithelial debris, of globules of lymph more or less perfectly formed or disintegrating, and of serum, not pus, and not auto-inoculable. In debilitated and unhealthy sub- jects, adds Lee, infecting sores will suppurate as any non-specific lesion would do, and in such cases it is sometimes very difficult to dis- tinguish the secretion produced by the local disease from that which depends upon constitutional peculiarity. The soft suppurating chancre is often multiple, has an excavated surface with neatly shaped and cut edges as if the wound had been punched out. It has an irregular and worm-eaten surface secreting abundance of pus. It is prone to spread rapidly and to become pba- gedsenic. It has usually a soft base, but if otherwise, it will have what Ricord has described a phlegmonous hardness, and not a defined one, as in the syphilitic chancre. It is commonly associated with a sup- purating bubo, and secretes pus, which “ has the property of always reproducing its specific action when applied to another part of the same body, or when inoculated upon another person.”—H. Lee. The experiments of Fournier, Rollet, and Lee’s observations, led the latter surgeon to “ conclude that if a venereal sore yields a secre- tion capable of being inoculated so as to produce the specific pustule, the evidence, so far as it goes, is in favour of its being a local disease, and of its not requiring constitutional treatment. If, on the contrary, a disease which we believe to be primary syphilis yields a secretion which is not auto-inoculable, then the evidence is against the local character of the affection and indicates a constitutional mode of treatment.” In this we read the type of the simple local venereal sore. In a clinical point of view, however, this great distinction between the two forms of chancre is not always definable; and consequently an intermediate class of cases in which syphilis occurs has to be recognised, approaching in their clinical features more the soft sore. There are, therefore, three forms of syphilitic sore, which the Government Committee on Syphilis has thus well described :— One characterised by induration throughout its entire course; One, soft in its early stage, and becoming subsequently indurated; and one soft throughout the whole course, but which, unlike the simple local sore, is followed by constitutional disease. Hard sores do not of necessity give rise to syphilis, whilst soft sores may. And it is an undoubted fact, that the question of induration or non-induration is greatly determined by the position of the sore; chancres upon the female genitals, simple or syphilitic, and chancres upon the glans penis, being rarely hard. The point, therefore, resolves itself into this—that the indurated chancre with a fair amount of probability, although not certainty, may be the precursor of syphilis, and not a merely local disease. The soft or non-indurated sore, in exceptional cases, may be due to a syphilitic inoculation, and be followed by the constitutional symptoms, although in the majority of cases, it is a purely local affection. A crop of soft sores fringing the prepuce, or surrounding the corona, is, in all probability, a simple and non-syphilitic disease.CHANCRE. 177 A spreading chancre with a suppurating bubo, is probably a local affection. A small single chancre indurated from the beginning, is the most suspicious of syphilis although even in this, there is no certainty of its being so. In fact, it is not possible to speak with any certainty as to a chancre being syphilitic or otherwise. Syphilis is a constitu- tional disease which can only be recognised by its constitutional symptoms, and not by the point of its inoculation. With respect to the period of incubation of a simple or syphilitic chancre no definite time can be given, since it varies from a few hours to a week; but the multiple suppurating simple chancres, as a rule, appear more rapidly after infection than any other, and the syphilitic chancre often does not appear for a week at least, sometimes two or three, after infection. Dr. Bumstead, of New York, says—“ that an interval of at least ten days will be found to have existed between infection and the appearance of the sore.” (Edition of ‘ Cullerier’s Atlas of Venereal Disease,’ 1868.) A chancre, like any ordinary sore, may present different appear- ances at different times. It may be at its origin vesicular, papular, pustular, or an excoriation, and pass through the ulcerating, granu- lating, and cicatrising stages ; in some cases the ulcerating stage will be a long one, while in another it may be so brief as hardly to be recognised. The action of the sore may vary with the condition of the patient, as well as with the condition of the part upon which it is placed, and it will be influenced probably by the nature or stage of the infecting sore from which the disease has been communicated. A chancre, like an ordinary sore when there is much local action and little constitutional power may become irritable, inflamed, or phage- dionic, more particularly when drink, irregular living, and debauchery have so enervated the system, as to render the patient unable to withstand the effects of any local irritation. These various actions may attack the chancre at any period of its progress. When a chancre is sloughing or phagedaenic from the first, and has originated from an inoculation of syphilitic matter, there is every reason to believe that the sloughing process may have a beneficial tendency, since the very intensity of the local effects of the poison may be the means of preventing its absorption, and thus, the outbreak of syphilis. When, however, the sloughing action appears during the ulcerating or later period of the chancre’s progress, it will have no such useful influence; for when syphilis is inoculated through a chancre, it is during its vesicular, papular, or pustular condition, prior to its ulcerative stage, and no action of the sore that appears after this period can have any effect in checking the diffusion of the poison. “ If the inflammation spreads fast,” writes Hunter, “it shows a constitution more than naturally disposed to inflammation; if the pain is great it shows a great disposition to irritation ; it also sometimes happens that they very early begin to form sloughs. When this is the case they have a strong tendency to mortification.” “ These three conditions of a sore,” adds Aston Key, commenting upon the above, “ distinct in their cause and in their operation from the syphilitic action, are ad- verted to, as pointing out the distinction that is to be drawn between the irritable, inflamed, and the sloughing chancre, and afford a guide VOL.

The uncertainty that most surgeons entertain as to the nature of a chancre, from the knowledge that any sore upon the penis ranging from a simple excoriation to an indurated chancre may be the inocu- lation of syphilis, renders it desirable and expedient that all sores should be destroyed at the very earliest period, and when this is effec- tually done before the ulcerative stage has set in, or during the vesi- cular, papular, or pustular, there is good reason to believe that syphilis may often be prevented. When, however, the sore exists as an ulcer, this abortive practice is useless, indeed, in the majority of cases, it makes a small sore large, retards recovery, and in no way prevents syphilitic symptoms appear- ing where the chancre had had a syphilitic origin. But, taking all together, not one chancre out of four has a syphilitic origin. For the destruction of a chancre on its first appearance, nitrate of silver, nitric acid, potassa fusa, or chloride of zinc may be employed, the base of the sore being well destroyed. When this is not done, the chancre should be treated on ordinary principles; to the inflamed, lead lotion, with or without opium, may be applied; to the sloughing, opium with tonics, internally, are indicated; to the indolent, nitric acid lotion or black wash are the best stimu- lants ; while to ordinary sores, water dressing should be used. A chancre requires no special treatment as a chancre, beyond its primary destruction from motives of expediency, or from reasons of weight to destroy a supposed syphilitic inoculation. The common practice of applying black wash to all sores on the penis is not needed; and to cauterise all chancres at every stage of their existence as soon as they come under notice is unnecessary. But when the powers of the patient are feeble, tonics are called for, and any special conditions are to be treated as common sense indicates. Medicines useful for syphilis should only be given when other evi- dence of syphilis exists beyond that afforded by the local inoculation. To treat all chancres alike, as if due to syphilis, is uncalled for and unscientific ; by doing so many patients are sacrificed to a theory greatly to their detriment. Complications of Chancre. Phimosis is one of the most common, and is found in at least a fourth of all forms of chancre and at all stages of their progress, although with the sloughing sore, it is probably the most frequent. In the fringing preputial chancres, however, it is a common complication. It is an accidental accompaniment of a chancre, and is due to the in- flammatory infiltration of the prepuce. When not severe, it is not a condition of much importance, if local cleanliness be attended to, for as the chancres heal, the inflammatory oedema will subside and the parts assume their natural condition. When, however, oedema is present, and a blood-stained discharge mixed with the debris of broken-up tissues escapes from beneath the prepuce, and doubt consequently is felt as to the nature, position, and character of the chancre; when evidence exists that the parts beneath are undergoing a destructive process which demands direct local treatment, the prepuce must be slit up, the surgeon taking179 ON LOCAL VENEREAL TREATMENT. care to do this effectually; since through a want of due attention to this point, the glans penis may be destroyed or the prepuce perforated. When the sore has been exposed, it ought to be treated on ordinary prin- ciples. When a simple purulent discharge comes from the orifice of the prepuce, the constant use of water and simple lead or other injec- tion will probably suffice. Phimosis without inflammatory oedema rarely calls for treatment. Phagedsena. Venereal like other sores may slough, the suppurating chancre be- phagedena, ing more prone to take on this action than the non-suppurating and indurated. When a sore sloughs from the first, it will probably prove to be non-infecting, and even if syphilitic in its origin, it may lose its syphilitic nature, the sore when the sloughing action has ceased, be- coming a simple one. This action is at times so intense that the penis varies in rapidly swells, inflames, and becomes gangrenous after infection, the intensity, whole organ at times sloughing off; while at others, the action will be more partial. In exceptional instances, the mortification is of the dry kind. In May be of the Peninsular War, when the British troops were in Portugal, dry kind, this sloughing of the penis from inflammation was so severe that Inspector Fergusson (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. iv) wrote :—“ It is pro- bable more men have sustained the most melancholy of all mutilations ! during the four years at war in Portugal through this disease, which , was called the ‘ black lion,’ than the registers of all the hospitals in England could produce in the last century.” He attributed the severity of this affection to the free sexual intercourse of persons of Causes, different nations. How far this phagedama depends upon some peculiar power of the infecting poison, or upon the constitution of the individual patient is difficult to determine, although the latter probably has the greater influence, since when any such depressing agency as that caused by drink, excess of venery, or illness is present, phagedama is more likely to occur than under other circumstances. Treatment.—In the treatment of all cases of phagedama, opium, Treatment of tonics, and good living are the three essentials; while mercury and the pkagedama. iodide of potassium are inadmissible. Locally, the part must be kept cleau by frequent ablution, and to this end, the prepuce often requires to be slit up. Lotions of nitric acid, one drachm to five ounces of water; of carbolic acid, one part to thirty; of sulphate of copper, five or ten grains to the ounce; of potassio-tartrate of iron, from ten to twenty grains to the ounce are also useful, and opium in solution is often a good addition. When the disease spreads, local mercurial fumigation is said to be of value; but change of air is most beneficial. Adenopathy or bubo is a common complication of the simple as well Bubo, as of the infecting chancre; that is, it is found in the local venereal sore as well as in the inoculation of true syphilis, but in the former the gland as a rule suppurates, while in the latter it rarely does so, at any rate as a consequence of the local sore. “ Lymphatic absorption,” writes Lee, “ from a suppurating syphi- Lee’s views litic sore (simple) necessarily produces a suppurating bubo; any attempt to prevent such an affection from suppurating is entirely180 ON LOCAL VENEREAL DISEASES. In infecting chancres. Diagnostic value of bubo. Simple adenitis In simple futile. The disease within the lymphatic system is the same, and runs a similar course as that upon the surface of the body.” The bubo associated with the simple non-infecting sore is the direct result of the absorption of the specific pus, the matter in the interior of the gland retaining its specific characters, whilst that outside the gland is ordinary non-specific pus. As the disease advances, however, the two fluids mix, and the whole acquires the characters of the specific fluid, the surface of the sore about the glands becoming in this way inoculated. In the infecting and syphilitic chancre, the enlargement of the glands is usually indolent, and unconnected with suppuration. It appears within the first or second week of the inoculation, and many glands are usually involved, forming hard, indolent, painless swellings. In exceptional cases, however, where the sore is a source of local irrita- tion, suppuration of the glands may take place—the suppurating bubo in the course of the constitutional symptoms being no rare event. The presence or absence of suppuration in the inguinal glands is not therefore evidence of any positive value as to the existence or non- existence of a syphilitic affection. It may, however, be stated that a local sore on the penis associated with an adenopathy, which passes rapidly on to suppuration, is in all probability a local and not a syphi- litic affection, while a local sore with a simple induration of the glands is in all probability a syphilitic inoculation. In every form, therefore, of chancre, though more frequently in the local sore, simple adenitis or sympathetic bubo may be met with as a result of local irritation, which differs in no respect from the adenitis of any other local organ. One or more glands may be in- volved in the action, and suppuration may be acute, subacute, or chronic. In the simple local sore it is usually acute. As a rule, too, the sore formed by the venereal bubo, unlike that resulting from simple adenitis, instead of healing kindly, often takes on very much May ulcerate, the appearance of the local disease; the edges ulcerate, the opening enlarges, and a large sore is formed; indeed, from this action, the serpiginous sore, to which allusion will be made, often takes its origin. At times the bubo puts on a pbagedamic action and spreads fearfully. In rare cases, the glands are said to enlarge without any local lesion, this chronic enlargement being followed by syphilis. I have, how- ever, never seen a marked instance of this, and in reputed cases, have suspected the former existence of some overlooked local sore or fissure. Mr. Cock does not recognise the affection. Treatment.—There is nothing to be gained by suppuration of the ino-uinal glands, for even when associated with syphilis, the poison is not eliminated by such means, and when due to some simple local source of irritation is only an additional cause of annoyance. To endeavour to prevent suppuration is, consequently, a wise course, which can best be done by rest and the local application of co < in the form of ice in a bag, or lotions of lead, muriate of ammonia, or spirit. When suppuration is threatening or cannot be retarded, vvarm fomentations are the best, and as soon as pus has formed a tree inci sion should be made, followed by warm-water dressing or a poultice. A vertical incision, as a rule, is the best, but when the abscess is lar,re the opening should be made in the long axis. The application Bubo d'emblee. Treatmeht of bubo. Incision.HYDROCELE. 1S1 of leeches or iodine to a bubo that threatens to suppurate seems a useless practice. In the indolent bubo, or rather where indurated glands exist, local treatment is useless; though care should be observed that no local source of irritation is added to that of the sore, and no excess of exercise taken by which the inflammation may be increased. When the cellular tissue around the glands is infiltrated with inflam- matory products as indicated by its brawniness, &c., the value of local pressure by means of a pad and the spica bandage (Fig. 278) is un- pressure, questioned; while tonics, rest, and other constitutional treatment are beneficial. The local application of some mercurial ointment at times Locai appears to be of use, and a small blister, a strong solution of iodine or application, of nitrate of silver, is of value in hastening either the absorption of the inflammatory products or their suppuration. As soon as suppura- tion appears, the abscess should be opened. When a hard gland is left at the bottom of a suppurating wound, the American practice of apply- ing such a caustic as the potassa fnsa to its centre, to cause its death and subsequent sloughing, or Golding-Bird’s electrolytic caustic, oc- casionally is of great use, this practice being as useful in syphilitic glandular enlargements as in others. In some instances, the removal of the gland by the scalpel may be expedient. Sinuses must, if possible, Sinus-s lo be always be laid open. Wd "pen.

Opium, tonics, and other internal remedies must not be omitted. HYDROCELE OF THE CORD AND OF THE TESTICLE. Hydrocele or a collection of serous fluid in close connection with the Definition testicle or spermatic cord, is a term which lias been applied to two classes of cases which differ in their progress as well as in their pathology, and agree only in the one marked and prominent symptom to which the term hydrocele is applicable. For clinical purposes, however, the word has certain advantages, and, with this view, may still be employed. Accepting the term, therefore, as signifying a collection of fluid in close contact with the testicle or spermatic cord, two great divisions of the subject at once suggest themselves, namely, the vaginal Varieties. hydrocele or the collection of fluid into some portion of the tunica vaginalis either of the cord or testicle, and the encysted hydrocele which is an expanded and newly formed cyst, as a rule, in connection with the epididymis, and but rarely with the body of the testis. On the formation of the serous sac.—It is well known to all who On the have studied physiology that the testicle in its descent from the formation of loin during foetal life draws with it into the scrotum two layers serous sae- of peritoneum with its attendant nerves and vessels, and that all pass through the internal and external abdominal rings in front of the cord into the scrotum. The posterior layer of peritoneum being in close connection with the fibrous capsule of the body of the testicle—the tunica albuginea—and the anterior in connection with the purse or scrotum. In a perfectly normal condition, it is generally supposed that at birth or shortly after, the two surfaces of this serous membrane close and become adherent, theHYDROCELE. 182 Hypothesis of anatomical conditions.

I, Pathology of hydrocele. canal which was at one time present ceasing to exist from the inter- nal abdominal ring to the upper portion of the testicle; while in the scrotum, the two serous surfaces remain permanently free for the pur- pose of allowing easy and ready mobility of the testicle in its scrotal covering. Mr. Birkett, however, has demonstrated that the prolonga- tion of the serous membrane down the inguinal canal into the scrotal sac often remains patent for a longer period than has generally been supposed, indeed in some cases it continues more or less as a pervious canal during the whole of life. It is owing to this fact that in a large proportion of the examples of oblique inguinal hernia, the bowel descends into the open vaginal process of the peritoneum which passes down with the testicle. In connection with this subject, the following anatomical facts may with some confidence be accepted :— That the opening into the peritoneal cavity at the internal ring is frequently open at birth and during the whole of adult life. That the vaginal process of the peritoneum may remain as a more or less open canal during childhood, and even up to old age; and that this tube may extend partially or wholly through the inguinal canal, and even into the scrotal vaginal sac. That this naturally formed peritoneal tube and sac may be closed at the internal or external abdominal rings, or at any intermediate spot between these points, or at its junction with the testis. As a consequence from these facts it is tolerably clear that a col- lection of serous fluid may take place in any part of this prolonged serous channel, and that a hydrocele of the cord or testis of different kinds may be produced. We thus find during infant and early life, from a want of closure of this tube at the internal ring or at some lower part of its course, that a serous exudation may take place into the cord or the scrotal portion of this peritoneal sac, and, that under the former circum- stances a congenital hydrocele of the cord, and under the latter, con- genital hydrocele of the testicle is said to exist. When the tubular portion of the canal is closed above, and the testicular part is open, a simple vaginal hydrocele exists ; and, when the tubular portion of the canal is not closed below, the hydrocele may extend more or less up the canal even as far as the internal ring. In another class of cases, the serous fluid may be confined between the internal and external rings, giving rise to the so-called diffused hydrocele of the cord; and, when it occupies a still more restricted space, it is usually described as an encysted hydrocele of the same part. The pathology of all these different conditions remains, too, the same, the different position of the fluid being accidentally determined by the extent and lines of adhesion, or the closure of the peritoneal testicular prolongations. A reference to Figs. 261-2-3, given to illustrate the subject of hernia, p. 642, vol. i, will assist the student in understanding these points. The Pathology of Hydrocele. It may with considerable confidence be asserted that, as a general rule, the secretion of the serous fluid which gives rise to the ordi- nary vaginal hydrocele is due to an inflammatory affection of the tunica vaginalis ; because in certain cases, flocculiof pure lymph may be183 HYDROCELE. seen floating in the secretion, while in others spontaneous coagulation of the same may be observed. The thickening of the tunica vaginalis, moreover, which so frequently takes place in chronic cases, the presence of membranous bands and septa in the cavity of the serous sac, and the fact that this form of hydrocele may be produced by extension of the inflammatory action from the epididymis or the body of the testicle, point likewise to the same conclusion. It is not, however, so clear that an inflammatory action has any in- fluence in the production of the serous effusion in the congenital form of hydrocele,‘in which a communication still exists between the ab- dominal peritoneal cavity and the scrotal serous sac; indeed, it would rather appear as if the exudation was of a passive nature and merely an excess of the natural secretion of the serous membrane, since in many of these cases the fluid rapidly disappears under tonic treatment, being re-absorbed as the powers of the patient improve, and vice versd. The fluid of a vaginal hydrocele is invariably albuminous, as the Fluid of secretion of all serous membranes contains albumen in solution, and hydrocele, under the influence of an inflammatory action, this is markedly in- creased ; hence, the amount of albumen in the fluid of a hydrocele is determined by the nature and violence of the inflammatory action. In some cases of the vaginal, as of the congenital variety, we thus find it as a thin, serous, and saline fluid of a clear colour, slightly tenacious and albuminous, the fluid differing in no single point from the natural serous fluid of the peritoneal cavity, while in others, it is of a more tenacious character, varying from a pale amber to a deep straw colour. In some examples, the fluid will be stained with blood, in others it will hold cholesterine in suspension, at times being perfectly opaque and syrupy from the presence of such matters. It, is, however, in the old and chronic cases alone that these last conditions are to be observed. In the acute vaginal hydrocele, more or less fibrin will be found either In acute in solution, or in the form of false membrane or adhesions between the Ciise9- two surfaces of the serous nembrane; and, in the chronic, the walls of In chronic the cyst will be found to have undergone great changes; the thin caseB- clear membrane having become thick and opaque, owing to the organiza- tion of the inflammatory product which had been poured out into its tissue, and in certain cases containing cartilaginous or ossific deposits, while on its surface, it will present a firm fibrous appearance. In rare cases, suppuration lias been observed to occur in the tunia vagi- nalis, but this result is beyond my experience, except as the effect of some external irritation or plan of treatment which had been adopted for its cure. Uncomplicated hydrocele, or a simple effusion into the tunica vagi- nalis, unassociated with any disease of the testis or epididymis, is generally a painless and insidious affection ; it attracts attention mainly by its size, and demands treatment chiefly from the mechanical incon- venience it causes. It is generally of slow progress, and, as a rule will be found to have existed for many months before seen by the surgeon, the patient seeking advice only when the organ has become cumbersome, and from its weight, has excited some pain and dragging in the lumbar region.HYDROCELE. 184 Diagnosis or mode of examination. Position of testicle. Translu- cencv. Shape, &e Statistics of hydrocele. The Clinical Examination of a Hydrocele of Testicle. On examining a testicle the seat of this disease, the enlargement will be found free and readily moveable, and to occupy the position of that organ which it includes. On inquiring into the history oftbe case, it will he ascertained that the swelling appeared primarily in connec- tion with the testis, and gradually encroached upon the upper portion of the scrotum towards the external ring, while on careful examination, the cord will generally be felt clear and distinct above the tumour. In exceptional cases, however, the fluid xvill be found to pass upwards through the external as far as the internal ring, it being tolerably clear in such examples that the peritoneal testicular process lias closed only at one point, and that is at its internal abdominal opening (Fig. 261). On taking the tumour in the hand it will be found to be light, and on passing the fingers over its surface it will be felt smooth and uniform. Fluctuation will also readily be detected on the slightest and most delicate palpation. The position of the testicle should then be looked for and made out; its natural site being somewhat posterior, and in large tumours, towards the upper part. But it must be borne in mind that in certain examples, that is, in cases in which, the organ is mal- placed, the testicle may be in front of or below the tumour. The best test of its presence is afforded by manipulation; the peculiar testicular pain felt on the application of pressure affording a certain indication. The question of translucency should next demand attention, for when present it is of peculiar importance, and indicative of the vaginal hydrocele. It must be remembered, however, that such a symptom is not constant, since it is neither present in cases of hydrocele in which the fluid is thick, bloody, or opaque, nor when the walls of the vaginal tumour have become thickened by fibrinous deposit. It should be added, that for this translucency to be well observed, the integuments of the scrotum should be firmly stretched over the scrotal enlargement. The tumour is generally described as being of a regular and pyri- form shape, but this condition is very variable, since the shape of the swelling depends upon the openness of the tubular peritoneal membrane of the cord and the connection which exists between the surfaces of the tunica vaginalis testis and tunica vaginalis scroti. When the canal has closed and withered down to the hody of the testis, the swelling will be more or less globular; and the higher the point of closure of the vaginal peritoneal sac towards the internal ring, the more pyra- midal will the watery swelling necessarily become. If adhesions exist between the two layers of serous membrane at the lower portion of the testis, the hydrocele will appear to be at the upper part; and, when the natural contraction between the tunica vaginalis of the cord and of the testicle is not completed (Fig. 263), an irregular or even hour-glass contraction may make its appearance—the outline of a hydrocele depending much upon the anatomical conditions of the part in which it is situated, and the pathological changes which may have resulted from the affection. The true pyriform swelling is best seen in children, when the fluid will be found frequently to pass well up the cord, although in adults it is not uncommon. Hydrocele occurs at all ages, but it is somewhat common at birth and middle age, and in a large proportion of cases appears, as a one- sided affection, and seems to affect the right or left testis indiscrimi-185 HYDROCELE. nately. Curling informs us that of 115 cases, 65 occurred on the right, 44 on the left side, and 6 were double ; while out of 117, my own cases, consecutively observed in which these facts were noted, 41 occurred on the right side, 62 on the left, and 14 were double, results coin- ciding with the opinions of Velpeau, Gerdy, and others. By way of summary it may he said, a chronic vaginal hydrocele General appears as a painless enlargement of the testicle, of slow and unequal growth, and of variable size, with a smooth and uniform sur- face, and more or less tense and fluctuating feel. It is invariably moveable within the scrotum, and, as a rule, appears to he distinct from any abdominal connections. The presence of the testis within the swelling can generally be made out by the testicular pain, which is produced by pressure at its posterior and upper portion, if the tumour be large, and at its lower if small; or by the absence of translucency at one spot—the tumour, as a rule, transmitting light when its scrotal coverings have been well stretched. It has a tendency to remain tranquil for many years, and by age simply increases in size. It occasionally grows to enormous dimensions, when the penis may become buried within the swelling; but never proves dangerous to life. It causes pain and requires treatment mainly from mechanical causes. Hydrocele of the Cord.—It has been already briefly explained how a Hydrorele of hydrocele of the cord may be produced, and under what circumstances cord> it may appeal- as a diffused or a so-called encysted tumour. It has likewise been shown, how these two conditions are but modifications of diagnosis, the same disease, the difluseness or isolation of the affections being determined by the adhesion, or more or less complete closure of the vaginal process of peritoneum as it passes downwards into the scrotum. Thus, a congenital hydrocele of the cord will be present, when, from a Congenital, want of closure at the abdominal orifice of the vaginal peritoneal pro- cess, serous fluid can gravitate downwards as far as the external ring, where the canal is obliterated; and a diffused hydrocele of the cord will be said to exist when, either at an early or late period of life, serous Diffused, fluid collects in the vaginal process closed at the internal ring and between it and the external ring or upper portion of the testis; while in a third class of cases an encysted hydrocele of the cord may appear as a Encvstcd. small isolated bag of serous fluid moveable with the cord and connected with it, situated between any of these points, its circumscribed nature having been determined by a more complete closure of the vaginal Pathology, peritoneal process, and the limited space into which the effusion has taken place. Under all these conditions, however, the pathology of the affection Symptoms, is the same, and the symptoms indicating its presence vary only ac- cording to the size and tension of the sac which contains the fluid. In the congenital form in which a communication exists with the peri- toneal cavity, the hydrocele will fluctuate and have a smooth and uniform outline, but it can never be tense. It will also disappear more or less readily by pressure, or by elevating the testicle on the patient assuming the recumbent position, when the fluid will gravitate into the abdominal cavity, with a rapidity which varies according to the size of the peritoneal communication. In the diffused hydrocele of the cord, this disappearance of the swell- ing by rest or pressure will not take place, for in such, the opening ofSingle cyst may simulate morliid growth.

The tumour will thus appear as a baggy or tense elastic swelling in the inguinal canal which it will more or less fill. It will give to the hand a sensation of fluctuation, and, in certain instances, may appear translucent, it will moreover, on any traction of the testicle, be found moveable, and painful in proportion to the Fig- 377- amount of tension of the cyst or of the inflammatory action. In the more localised or apparently cystic hydrocele of the cord, the same symptoms will present themselves. The tumour will be more isolated, probably more moveable and more tense, and it will be readily acted on also by any traction on the testis. It may occur as a single cyst or as many cysts, but each will present the same symptoms. When a single, tense, move- able cyst exists, it may be mis- taken for a distinct morbid growth ; but the diagnosis of the case ought not to be difficult when care is observed. Fig. 377 well illustrates the ordinary appearance of the affection. Treatment of the vaginal hydrocele of the testis.—In the congenital hydrocele of young life, surgical treatment should be very simple, for the disease as a rule readily disappears with age and in- creasing strength. A little cold lotion applied to the part, such as a solution of the hydrochlorate of ammonia and tonic medicine, is frequently sufficient to effect a cure ; for, as I have already stated, the effusion into the vaginal sac in these instances seems to be often of a passive nature. The hydrocele found in infancy is not, however, always of the congenital form; as a hydrocele may exist in an infant in which there is no communication with the peritoneal abdominal cavity through the neck of the vaginal process, and, under these circumstances, a dif- ferent treatment may be required. Cold lotions and tonics may be of use, and certainly should be primarily employed; yet in many instances, the treatment will fail to cure the case. Acupuncture may be then employed, and the fluid allowed to escape into the cellular tissue around the sac, when it may be altogether removed by absorption; but this treatment is not as a rule satisfactory, it being exceptional for a per- manent recovery to be secured by such means, and I am disposed to think it better practice to draw off the fluid by means of a fine trocar and canula, and to excite some fresh action in the membrane lining the tunica vaginalis by stirring it up with the end of the canula. This practice has been very successful in my experience. The treatment of vaginal hydrocele in t he adult. In early examples, when the hydrocele is still small, and consequently of little inconvenience, it is well, perhaps, to leave it alone, for unless it causes anxiety to the patient, or proves troublesome or inconvenient187 HYDROCELE. from its size, there is no necessity for interference. In very old people it is as well not to interfere, unless a strong necessity exists, as sloughing of the scrotum, suppuration of the sac, and other bad results, occasionally occur in these cases from slight causes. It must be added, that the feelings of the patient as to the amount of pain and inconvenience are the best guide to interference, very slight enlarge- ment causing as much pain in some patients as a greater increase in others. If, then, some treatment he demanded, simple tapping should be performed as a primary measure, the fluid being drawn off by means of a moderate-sized trocar and canula. In doing this, some care is necessary, although the operation is really simple, as difficulties are often made by the operator, while dangers result from want of caution. On the Tapping of a Hydrocele. As a point of primary importance, the true position of the testicle On the should be defined. In the majority of cases it will be found at the pos- operation of terior part of the tumour and towards its lower part, unless the hydro- h^-clrocele. cele he very large. At times, however, as has been observed, it will be found in front from a congenital malposition,as well as in certain other cases which are difficult to explain. The true position of the gland can generally be made out by manipulation, and further by the want of translucency in the tumour at the part it occupies. Having made out to a fair certainty the position of the testis, the tumour should be taken in the left hand and grasped firmly at its neck—the surgeon taking cave at the same time to stretch the integument well over the cyst, and to render its wall tense and unyielding (Fig. 378). The trocar with well-fitting canula (having been previously well oiled) should then be taken in the right hand, and the Fig. 378. : index-finger placed about three quarters of an inch from the extre- 'i mity of the canula, while the front of the thumb rests on its flange. The object of this position of the finger is to prevent the instrument 1 going in too far with a rush, and thereby endangering the testicle; and that of the thumb to press home the canula as the trocar is being withdrawn. The tumour should be punctured at its lower part, care being taken to avoid any large vein, and the fluid allowed to run out. Having completely emptied the cyst, the punctured integument should i be firmly held and nipped up with the thumb aud finger of the left188 HYDROCELE. May excite inflammation in certain cases.

Treatment of diffused form. hand, and the canula withdrawn, a little cold air or the irritation of the finger generally causing sufficient contraction of the dartos to close the wound and preventing haemorrhage or any further escape of the remain- ing fluid. A piece of lint, however, may be applied over the puncture for purposes of cleanliness and to prevent friction. In certain examples of this disease in the adult, I have been induced to stir up the cyst as I have described in the hydrocele of the young, and have met with some success. In no instance has any evil consequence resulted from the practice, and in several, a cure has taken place, evi- dently from inflammation. I would advise this practice to be confined, however, to young adults. As a palliative practice it is scarcely neces- sary to recommend any other than that described, as it is simple, more efficacious than any other, and uot more dangerous. Acu- puncture has been advised, but it has no practical advantage over the simple tapping, and it is certainly less successful in its result. In exceptional cases it may be good, particularly in such a case as Mr. Curling has described on the authority of Mr. Luke, of a gentleman who was about to proceed to a part of the world where surgical advice could not be secured, and where the patient could then perform this simple operation on himself. I have even known a patient to tap himself. The period of relief which a patient experiences from a simple tapping varies exceedingly from a few weeks to many years; and even in the same patient the interval will be found to vary from time to time. In the young and middle-aged adult, when the general health is sound and a return of the effusion has taken place, unless any personal ob- jection should be made, it is generally advisable to adopt some plan for a more permanent cure. In old men it is the soundest practice to rest satisfied with the palliative treatment; and in such the radical cure should be proposed only in exceptional cases. Treatment of hydrocele of the cord.—The principles of treatment w'hich have been laid down in cases of hydrocele of the testis are like- wise applicable to those of hydrocele of the cord, their application requiring only such modifications as may be demanded by the altered position of the affection. In the congenital hydrocele, no special treat- ment is required, because, as strength comes to the child, the fluid probably will be re-absorbed, and failing this result, tonics should be given to expedite the cure, and cold lotion applied such as the chloride of ammonium with vinegar, 5j to Oj. In the diffused or encysted hydrocele of the child or adult, more active treatment is frequently demanded, though not in all cases; the fluid will at times disappear without treatment, though it may recur at a later date; still the affection ceases to trouble, and, unless some real inconvenience is produced by its presence, it is as well to leave things alone. When, however, pain or iuconvenience is ex- perienced, something must be done, and no doubt the best prac- tice is to evacuate the fluid. In small, tense, encysted hydroceles, the practice of evacuating the fluid by acupuncture is certainly sound, since tapping by the trocar and canula is an operation of some difficulty where the cyst is small. It may be done with any needle, but those employed for cataract are probably the best, and several openings should be made. Tapping may be employed as in any other case of ordinary hydrocele. I have used on several occasions with successENCYSTED HYDROCELE. 189 the radical cure by injection, and have not met with any bad results. When this treatment fails and further measures are demanded, as a last resource, an incision into the cyst may be made. On the Kadical Cure of Hydrocele. On radical cure of It is not necessary to review all the various plans which have been hydrocele, and are now employed for the permanent cure of a hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis. It will be more to the purpose to give the line of practice which is most successful and which at the same time is very simple, viz. the injection of the cyst with a solution of iodine. It is Selection of perhaps not a question of much importance whether the fluid should injection and be concentrated or diluted, or whether it should be permanently left 113 streil=lli' in the cyst or withdrawn after a few minutes have been allowed for it to act upon the secreting surface, such minor differences may be left to the fancy of the operator. My own judgment leans towards the practice of injecting a mixture of a drachm or more of the com- pound tincture of iodine with double the quantity of water, and allow- ing it to remain, care being taken that the canula is previously well pushed home into the cyst, and that no iodine solution is allowed to escape into the cellular tissue outside the sac. By this practice, a radical cure is almost certain to be secured, and only exceptionally does any failure or evil result follow. If the latter occur, it is generally due to the fact, that a hydrocele has been injected when some inflammation of the testicle co-exists, and from which it has been produced. In all examples of hydro-testitis, the practice of injection must be looked upon as injurious, and is treating tbe result of a disease, and not the disease itself, the effect, and not the cause. I do not propose to enlarge upon the other forms of treatment which have been employed, such as incision, caustic, or even setons; since the practice I have advocated is so simple and successful as to surpass all others. Within the last two years where the iodine has failed I have used warm water as an injection. It answered well, but set up more inflammatory action than the iodine, indeed, in several cases, it excited suppuration. Some of the Dublin surgeons speak highly of the practice of introduc- ing into the sac of the tunica vaginalis a grain or more of the biniodide of mercury made into a paste with some grease, and I have followed this practice in some cases with advantage. I prefer, how- ever, the iodine treatment. On Encysted Hydrocele of the Testis. On examining the testis of the adult after death, it is by no means o» encysted an uncommon occurrence to meet with small cysts connected with the hydrocele of epididymis. These may be single or multiple, and, in many instances, te"3t's. are very numerous. They are generally more or less pedunculated, and as a rule, are connected with the upper portion of the epididymis,' and filled with a clear watery fluid which contains in certain cases some granules. The pathology of the formation of these cysts is somewhat difficult Patholo-y. to understand, and, surgically, is of small importance, since they seldom, if ever, become of sufficient size to cause inconvenience, or to require any operative interference; indeed, they are rarely diagnosed during life, and are only discovered on post-moi’tem dissection.190 ENCYSTED HYDROCELE. Variety. Frequency. Another variety. Symptoms. Peculiarity iu shape. Position of testis. Another kind of cyst is occasionally met with connected with the testis, and in close contact, if not associated, with the epididy- mis. It has been described as the encysted hydrocele. It springs from the same part as the smaller cyst, hut grows to much larger di- mensions, and generally contains a very different kind of fluid. Its origin is as obscure as the former. It enlarges very slowly, does not give rise to any pain, nor produces any inconvenience other than that caused by its size. It seldom requires treatment in its early stage, and, as a rule, many years are allowed to pass before interference is demanded, the tumours frequently developing for twenty years or more before advice is sought. These cases are by no means so common as the ordinary vaginal hydrocele—not more than 5 per cent, of the cases of hydrocele being of this kind. A cyst is occasionally developed between the tunica albuginea of the testis and the tunica vaginalis testis, the pathology of which being very obscure. Mr. S. Osborne suggests, and I think with good reason, that this is merely an enlargement of the corpus or hydatid of Morgagni,— a constant structure, existing as a pedunculated vesicle situated between the summit of the globus major and the body of the testicle, between the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis and the tunica albuginea (‘ St. Thomas’s Hospital Report,’ 1S74). Cases of this kind are de- scribed by Curling and Hutchinson. Guy’s Museum contains a spe- cimen. I know of no means of diagnosing their existence. Their treatment would be similar to that of other cysts. Symptoms and diagnosis.—In an early stage of encysted hydrocele the diagnosis is not difficult, as the cyst usually appears as a kind of budding of the testis or rather of the upper portion of the epididymis, as a tense hard, globular, and, in some cases, pendent tumour, more or less intimately connected with some portion of the spermatic duct. It is generally discovered on the part of the patient by accident, and, when as large as the natural testicle, has been set down occasionally as an extra organ. The surgeon is not often consulted in such a case in its early stage; the tumour having been allowed to grow to an inconvenient size before advice is sought. In forming a diagnosis, the history of the case will often at once throw some light upon its nature; and the surgeon, in all probability, will discover that its increase has been extremely slow, twenty years or more often intervening before the cyst attains anything like a large size; these encysted hydroceles probably never growing so fast nor acquiring such dimensions as the more common vaginal species. The next feature demanding attention in the development of these cysts is their shape and outline, which are often rather striking. They never in their early stage, and rarely at any time assume the appear- ance of ordinary vaginal hydrocele, and almost always maintain a globular outline. The position of the testis in its relation to the cyst next claims attention, and a marked difference exists between the encysted and the vaginal hydrocele. In the latter, as a rule, it is to be found at the posterior part of the sac,—when the tumour is small towards its lower, when large towards its upper part. In the former, or encysted, it is to be found in front, at one side, or below, and rarely at the pos- terior part. The reason for this is easily explained. The cyst isENCYSTED HYDROCELE. 191 usually connected with the epididymis which normally lies at the posterier part of the gland. _ The nature of the cystic contents differs also in many points from Nature of the fluid of a vaginal hydrocele, and is very characteristic. In the cystic vaginal hydrocele the fluid has been described as being generally clear, like the serum of the blood, more or less albuminous, of a straw colour, Vaginal and, at times, spontaneously coagulable, blood and cliolesterin being 1'ydrocele. also occasional elements. In the fluid of an encysted hydrocele, none Encysted of these elements are generally present; but, as a rule, is a limpid, hydrocele, slightly saline liquid, more or less watery or opalescent, as if mixed with milk, altvays containing some granules in suspension and fre- quently spermatozoa. Cystic hydrocele differs from the vaginal in the slowness of its growth, its globular outline, the anterior position of the testicle, aud the nature of its cystic contents. The origin of the spermatozoa in these cysts is a point of pecu- Origin of liar interest, and has been a disputed point with pathologists for spermatozoa, many years. Mr. Curling’s investigations on this subject have proved, that in some instances, their presence is certainly due to the rupture of one of the spermatic tubes w'hich pass over and are in close connection with the walls of the cyst—this rupture taking place generally from an injury, and being indicated by some rapid increase in the size of the cyst. Mr. Curling has shown that this history was given in several of the cases in which spermatozoa wrere found, and in some he was even able to demonstrate a distinct communication between the cyst and the spermatic tube. The following case tends bo support his views. Robert P—, set. 60, came under my care, at Illustrative Guy’s Hospital, on December 28tli, 1863, with an encysted hydrocele case- l of the left testicle of twenty years’ growth. The increase had been very flow until the last month, when the tumour had doubled its normal i size, this rapid growth having followed an injury produced by a fall. When first under my observation, the scrotum contained an irregular :ystic tumour on its left side, evidently made up of several cysts, of vhich three of large size could readily be distinguished, two being very ;ense, while the third was baggy. The testis was found on the inner tide of the tumour. Tapping was at once resorted to, and the largest ;yst emptied, many ounces of a milky fluid being drawn off. The econd tense cyst was then tapped through the same opening, with a limilar result, and the fluid collected in a distinct glass. The third cyst vas also tapped, but in this the fluid was quite watery. The first two lontained abundance of spermatozoa, while the third did not contain my. A good recovery took place.

Pott, Curling, and Sir B.Brodie relate cases of this kind, and attempt to explain the process by which such a recovery takes place with more or less success. A single instance of the kind has passed under my hands for treatment. Charles C—, set. 64, came to Guy’s Hospital on Jan. 29th, 1863, ! with a hydrocele of the left testis, the size of a cocoa-nut. It had been of two years’ standing, and been tapped six times, having been under my ' care on each occasion. He came under my notice at this date, when [ was about to leave the hospital, and I did no more than examine the parts which were tense and painful, telling the patient to return | to me in the course of a few days to be relieved. When he came the following week, all indication of swelling had completely disappeared the man assuring me that he had gone to bed the night of the second day before his visit with a large tumour, and that when he awoke it had disappeared. He added also that on the following morning he had passed a large quantity of thin urine. The patient was a steady man and a widower, and told his tale with all the appearance of truth and with some astonishment. In three months the fluid had re-collected, when he was tapped. I will not attempt an explanation of this case. HEMATOCELE. As the term “ hydrocele ” is applied to the effusion of serous fluid into the sac of the tunica vaginalis and of its tubular prolongation upwards to the internal ring, as well as into the cysts which have been already described as being connected with the testis, so the term “ hmmatocele” is employed to designate an effusion of blood into the same parts. We thus have— A vaginal and an encysted hasmatocele of the testis. A diffused and an encysted hsematocele of the cord. Hsematocele may occur iu an organ which had not previously shown any symptom of disease, or, it may be, associated with a hydrocele. It may appear spontaneously without an injury, or as the result of a blow, strain, or the tapping of a hydrocele. It may attack patients at any period of life, and in certain rare cases at a very early age, even in infancy. I have the records of a case in which it was said to have made its appearance at two years of age. In the notes of my cases various causes have been assigned for its production. In more than one instance “ it appeared gradually without any known cause.” In another “ it occurred when hard at work push- ing a wheelbarrow, something giving way with a snap.” In the majority it came on as an immediate consequence of a blow', and iu several, as the result of the tapping of a hydrocele. Iu all, however, the result was the same—a more or less rapid formation of a tumour in the position or neighbourhood of the testicle. Symptoms and diagnosis.—The symptoms of a hsematocele which has made its appearance without any injury or assigned cause are very obscure, and are pretty well summed up in the prominent one of a gradual and uniform enlargement of the organ. The swelling will vary in shape as in a hydrocele, but, like it also, may present a more or less pyriform outline. The testicle will always, in the vaginal hmmato- cele (on careful manipulation being made), be detected somewhere in193 HEMATOCELE. A the sac, and usually at its posterior and lower part, the peculiar testicular sensation being produced by slight pressure. When caused by a sudden strain or injury, the enlargement will be 'When caused more sudden as well as rapid, and he found to follow close upon the by injury, receipt of the accident, while the rupture of the blood-vessel may he announced by the sensation of a sudden snap or giving way. The local symptoms are similar to those already described. The tumour, on its first appearance, may be somewhat soft and obscure, or clear fluctuation may be detected in it; hut if much time be allowed to pass before coming under observation, this fluctuation will not, in all probability be made out, for the effused blood rapidly coagulates, and gives rise to the sensation of a solid growth. The sac of the hsemato- cele whether tunica vaginalis or cyst, rapidly alters in character and becomes thick, and in certain cases fibrinous, or even cartilaginous; at first from the coagulation of the fibrine of the blood upon its inner surface, and, in cases of longer standing, from distinct inflammatory changes brought about by the presence of the blood acting as foreign matter. In some instances this thickening of the cyst is very great, even to the extent of half an inch. When a haematocele has followed upon a hydrocele, there will usually when he a sudden enlargement of the part after the strain or injury, accom- following panied with more or less pain, this pain apparently depending upon the hydrocele, amount of distension to which the cyst has been subjected. If it follows the operation of tapping, it will, as a rule, be recognised by the escape of more or less blood or bloody fluid at the time of operation, and the rapid re-filling of the hydrocele sac or cyst with a more solid and opaque material. To form a correct diagnosis of haematocele the history of the case is most important; indeed, more so than the local symptoms, for it is certainly true, that by the latter alone, in some instances, it is almost impossible to make out the true nature of the affection. By way of summary it may be stated that a haematocele is usually a Summary, uniformly smooth, tense, and »o»-transparent tumour, with an indis- tinct sensation of fluctuation, but with distinct evidence of testicular pain on pressure. It may be accompanied with pain during the early period of the affection from the distension of the cyst, but not at a later date, or during its chronic stage, unless softening down. As time passes, it will become harder, if no symptoms of inflammation show themselves; but on them manifestation, evidence of suppuration will soon appear, for hHematoceles have not, as a rule, a disposition to remain quiet like hydroceles, but tend to open outwards by the breaking up of the coagulated blood which has been effused, and the inflammatory process. The symptoms which indicate the presence of a haematocele of the Symptoms of spermatic cord are somewhat similar to those already described for l*®matocele vaginal haematocele, the difference in locality being remembered. It cor'd ematlC is generally produced by a blow or strain, as in the ordinary vaginal haematocele. It can he diagnosed by the suddenness of its appearance, or the suddenness of the enlarged hydrocele sac, by the opacity of | the swelling and tendency to consolidation which it possesses, also by the accompanying ecchymosis of the parts. Cases are recorded by Bowman, Curling, and others, in which this disease obtained enormous • dimensions, but such examples are very rare; the affection beino- very ) uncommon. ° J VOL II. 13194 HEMATOCELE. On the source _ 9n the source of the hlood.—A very common question with students of tlie blood is, as to the origin of the blood in these cases of liaematocele, and in hrematocele ^le 8Pontaneous cases all<i those following a strain or injury with an apparently sound testis, this question is difficult to answer with cer- tainty of accuracy. There can be little doubt, however, that a distinct rupture of some of the vessels, probably veins, which ramify upon the body of the testis, or on the tunica vaginalis, must have taken place. When occurring upon a hydrocele or after the operation of tapping, it is probably due to the distinct rupture or perforation of one of the large veins which ramify outside the tunica vaginalis, into its interior, or of one belonging to the body of the testis. Scarpa relates a case of liaematocele in which the spermatic artery was wounded, and Sir A. Cooper another in which a distinct rent in the tunica vaginalis was found on dissection. This latter condition is probably the most common. Treatment of Treatment.—The treatment of haemorrhage into the tunica vaginalis lisamatocele. testis, or cord differs in no respect from the treatment of haemorrhage into any other part of the body. In the very earliest period of its occurrence, rest in the horizontal posture, with the testicles well raised and the application of ice or cold lotion are the most efficient means to arrest the flow of blood and relieve pain. By such means, the blood may also be reabsorbed and all future mischief prevented. Should the blood, however, remain fluid for a long time, and no symptoms of re-absorp- tion or of inflammatory action manifest themselves, it is a sound prac- tice to draw off the fluid contents with a trocar and canula. I have had a case in which this course was adopted with good effect. If signs of inflammation appear soon after its occurrence, cold lotions and leeches, with the aid of saline purgatives, may occasionally be found efficient in arresting its progress, and to allow of the subsequent re-absorption of the effused blood. But should symptoms of suppuration Free incision, show themselves, or of the softening down of the coagula, a free in- cision into the cyst or tunica vaginalis is the only sound practice, the whole semi-solid contents being thoroughly turned out, and the interior • of the sac allowed to granulate. In old and chronic cases, with thick- ened sac walls, the same treatment is also effectual. I possess the records of many cases in which this plan was carried out with marked benefit. In one case of only four months’ duration, and in another of twenty-nine years, in which the tunica vaginalis was at least half an inch thick, and in both, a good recovery followed. I need hardly add that excision is rarely called for in the treatment of these cases, although owing to difficulties in the diagnosis it may occasionally have been had recourse to. I have seen several such instances, but beyond the loss of the organ no evil resulted. In old cases of heematocele in Excision. aged subjects, the practice of excision is probably the best; but in the young and middle-aged it cannot be advised. The treatment of htematocele of the cord is to be conducted on similar principles.195 ON DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE. ON DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE. On Inflammation of tlie Testicle. Under the term Orchitis, most authors have been in the habit of on including the inflammation of two distinct portions of the testicle, and inflammation of mixing up the symptoms of the two affections to the prevention 01 testlcle- of a sound and clear understanding of the subject. In this chap- ter I shall attempt, to separate the two, and describe inflam- Division ot i mation of the epididymis as one affection, and inflammation of subJect’ the true secreting gland as another, calling the former epididymitis, and the latter orchitis. In cei’tain cases, it is true, both structures are in- i volved in the inflammatory action, and to this state I shall apply the term testitis; the three words accurately indicating the true seat of the malady, and their use, consequently, tending to facilitate its better study. All surgeons will be ready to admit the distinctness of these two ■i parts, anatomically and physiologically, viz. the epididymis and the i! gland. It is as well also to acknowledge that pathologically they : are constantly divided, and I am certain that, to the student of the •i affections of this organ, such a division tends to a more ready dis- ai crimination and appreciation of the several diseases of the testicle. t As a preliminary to the more special clinical and pathological con- i' sideration of these diseases, the following observations of Sir J. Paget, as given by Curling, upon the development of the epididymis and testis i may be read with interest and advantage. Sir J. Paget observes “ that, in the normal course of human develop- Development !i ment, the proper genital organs are in either sex developed in two of K«nital i| distinct pieces, namely, the part for the formation of the generative organSi it substance, the testicle or ovary, and the part for the conveyance of ; that substance out of the body, the seminal duct or ovi-duct. The a testicle, or ovary, as the case may be (and in their earliest periods : they cannot be distinguished) is formed on the inner concave side of : the corpus Wolffianum, and the seminal or ovi-duct, which is originally si an isolated tube closed at both extremities, passes along the outer dw border of that body from the level of the formative organ above, to ii b the cloaca or common sinus of the urinary, genital, aud digestive sys- • terns below. The perfection of development is attained only by the ■■ i; conducting tube acquiring its just connections at once with the tor- si!® mative organ, and through the medium of the cloaca with the exterior 1 of the body. The sexual character is first established when, in the , male, the formative and conducting organs become connected by the i!development of intermediate tubes which constitute the epididymis; 4 >r when, in the female, a simple aperture is formed at the upper ex- ri iremities of the conducting tube, and is placed closely adjacent to the • lormative organ. In both sexes alike the lower extremities of the 4 ionducting tubes first open into the common cloaca, and subsequently, t vhen that cavity is partitioned into bladder and rectum, or bladder, •t'agina, and rectum, they acquire in each their just connections, and ii lecome, in the male, the perfect vasa deferentia, and, in the female p 'allopian tubes and uterus.” I will remind the student that the epididymis naturally forms theEPIDIDYMITIS. 196 Epididymitis. Generally acute. Complica- tions. Orchitis. posterior and outer part of the testicle, and the secreting portion or true gland, the anterior; that the former in a perfectly healthy state is only indistinctly felt, the vas deferens on being traced downwards from the cord losing itself as it were in this part. The body of the gland can always be made out by its smooth and elastic globular form. On Epididymitis, or Inflammation of the Seminal Duct. Inflammation of the epididymis may be caused by some local inguinal injury, or the pressure of a truss, but as a rule it is a consecutive affec- tion, and occurs in association with gonorrhoea, or as the result of some irritation of the prostatic urethra, such as the presence of a calculus, or the passage of a sound or lithotrite. It is due to an ex- tension of inflammation from the urethra down the vas deferens to the epididymis, and is an inflammation of the seminal duct and not of the seminal gland. It generally comes on suddenly, and is attended with considerable pain; a marked enlargement of the epididymis or posterior part of the testicle forming its chief local symptom. It is constantly preceded by severe pain in the anal and iliac fossae, and accompanied by special tenderness of the part, this tenderness being readily traceable up the cord, which is occasionally swollen and cede- matous. It is usually attended with oedema and redness of the scrotum over the inflamed tube. The enlargement of the epididymis is very rapid, and in some instances very great. It invariably assumes a special outline when uncomplicated, that is, when confined to this special part, the epi- didymis appearing of a boat or truncated half-moon shape, holding the body of the testicle in its concavity. The lower portion of this body is usually the most enlarged, being composed of the greater number of the convolutions of the tubes, and consequently containing more con- nective tissue, since it is from the infiltration with inflammatory effusion of this connective tissue around the inflamed seminal duct that this enlargement is produced. The affection generally is acute, comes on suddenly, runs a rapid course, and is accompanied in most patients by some constitu- tional disturbance. In some subjects this is very severe, while in others it is of a milder description, the sharpness of the inflammation and the peculiarity of the patients influencing the severity. It is at times, however, complicated with other conditions, such as an inflammation of the true secreting portion of the testicle, but this complication invariably occurs as a secondary symptom, and is pro- duced by the direct extension of the disease from the seminal duct to the gland. I have never seen a genuine orchitis or inflammation of the seminal gland as a result of gonorrhoea, except as an extension of the inflammation from the epididymis, and it is in quite exceptional examples of this affection that the body of the testicle Lis ever involved. When the gland itself is inflamed, the diagnosis is readily made, the enlargement and great tenderness of the part clearly indicating what is the matter. The whole organ presents an expanded but flattened aspect, the swelling of the epididymis posteriorly, and of the body of the testis anteriorly producing this peculiar laterally flattened outline. The two inflamed parts will, however, be always felt distinct from each other, and can be readily distinguished. There is, however, a197 EPIDIDYMITIS. second complication of epididymitis, more common than that just described, which is, the effusion of fluid into the tunica vaginalis or the production of an acute hydrocele, and I am disposed to think, that it is this apparent swelling of the organ which has given rise to the mistaken idea, that true testitis is a common affection after gonorrhoea. The enlargement of the organ from such a condition is, however, very different from that already described as due to an inflamed gland. It is more globular, tense, and elastic; it is certainly equally painful with that affection, but its true nature can he readily made out by its translucency, and the presence of fluctuation on palpation. It is the result of a direct extension of the inflammation from the epididymis to the tunica vaginalis, and the following explanation of its occurrence by Gendrin, as given by Curling, who assents to its soundness, seems most satisfactory, since it is certainly borne out by clinical observation. He says, “when the subserous cellular tissue, which always participates in the inflammation of a serous mem- brane, penetrates into the interior of an organ, it becomes a ready means of commuuicating the inflammatory action, but when the con- tiguous organ in subjacent parts is of a different structure from that of the cellular tissue, the extension of inflammation inwards is checked. Thus, in the case of the inflamed tunica vaginalis, the cellular tissue readily transmitted the morbid action to the epididymis, but the tunica II albuginea arrested its progress to the body of the testicle, and this ex- plains the fact that, after inflammation of the tunica vaginalis excited by injection, the body of the gland is rarely found to suffer. On the other hand, the epididymis is seldom attacked with inflammation with- out the disease being quickly propagated to the tunica vaginalis.” The hydrocele, as a a rule, however, disappears as the disease subsides in the epididymis, it being exceptional for the former condition to remain when its cause has been removed. As a consequence of this epididymitis, it is by no means uncommon for a considerable thickening of the seminal ducts and of their surrounding cellular tissue to remain for many weeks or even months. In the majority of cases, however, this result does not take place, for in the healthy subject there is every reason to believe, that with the inflammation all effusion disappears, and the organ is left as sound as it was before. In the cachectic patient this happy event does not, however, always take place, and more or less thickening of the inflamed part will generally he observed, the epididymis feeling indu- rated and enlarged, and in parts nodulated and cordy. It has been a disputed point by pathologists whether this condition ever leads to an atrophy or destruction of the testicles, or whether it has any influence upon the true function of the organ in causing sterility, and upon this point I have no positive facts to adduce, though I have certainly seen a wasting of the glandular structure of the testicles after inflam- mation, the result of an epididymitis. In one instance, I witnessed inflammation of the body of the testis in a young man who married at a time when he had a marked induration of the epididymis, the result of an attack of inflammation some months previously. I entirely attributed the inflammation in his case to the retention of seminal secretion from the obstruction to the seminal duct the result of the old epididymitis, since we know that all ducts or canals, when surrounded by organised inflammatory products, are liable to obstruction or stric- ture, and it is only right to believe, that the spermatic ducts are Hydrocele. Obstruction of seminal duct.EPIDIDYMITIS. 198 Eight testicle most frequently attacked. As to the cause of epididymitis. Treatment. Suspension. obedient to the same law, although this result may not be very common. On the dictum of Sir A. Cooper, it has generally been asserted, that the left testis is more often attacked in cases of epididymitis than the right, hut Mr. Curling, in his admirable treatise on the testes, dis- proved the truth of this assertion and showed that in 138 cases of this affection the right testis was the seat of the disease in 78 examples, the left in 49, and both glands in 11. My own figures, too, bear out the truth of these conclusions, for out of 73 consecutive examples of epididy- mitis, 35 were of the right organ, 25 of the left, 4 double, while in 9 the fact was not stated. The right organ is, therefore, more often affected than the left, while in hydrocele, the left side is the most fre- quent seat of disease. With respect to the cause of the disease I took some pains during the eight years I was registrar at Guy’s to find out if the general opinion was correct that the epididymitis usually supervened on the disappearance of the urethral discharge, and was relieved on its reap- pearance ; or, if it could be traced to any peculiarity in the treatment of the gonorrhoea, to any neglect, or other cause. I have to confess that I was not able to connect these phenomena in any way, as the epididymitis made its appearance during all stages of the complaint, and under every kind of condition; when injections were employed, and when they were not, when copaiba and cubebs had been taken, and when they had not, although in some cases the diminution of the discharge and appearance of the epididymitis were coincident; but such a result is only consistent with the general rule, that an inflam- mation set up in one part tends to relieve an inflammation existing in another, and more particularly in a neighbouring tissue. The disease, however, appeared in the majority of cases of neglected gonorrhoea, and in others, in which strong injections had been recklessly employed; but more particularly in the cachectic and irregularly living patients who had been utterly regardless of their affection, and taken no means to keep the testes well suspended. Treatment of epididymitis.—The treatment of this affection must depend upon the intensity of the inflammation and the severity of the local and constitutional symptoms which it produces. Rest in the horizontal posture with elevation of the testes or even of the pelvis, active purgatives, with saline medicines combined in acute cases with tartar emetic or colchicum wine are advantageous; the local application of ice, hot poppy fomentations, or swathing the parts in cotton wool, are often sufficient to check the disease at its onset, and prevent its passing into a chronic stage. It is also a wise measure to administer an opiate at night. When the local symptoms and pain are very severe, leeches may he applied to the neck of the tumour, or one of the turgid veins in the scrotum opened. The use of mercury does not appear to be of much value, except as a purge. If the patient, however, from social reasons, objects or is unable to keep at rest, the parts must be well supported by a suspensory bandage and a very efficient suspensor is formed by a handkerchief folded cross- ways in a triangle, the apex of which is well braced up posteriorly by a piece of tape, or bandage, and the base attached firmly to a band brought round the waist. The same treatment must then be pursued as we have already indicated. (Fig. 379.)ORCHITIS. 199 The treatment hy compression, hy means of strapping or an india- Pressure, rubber bag has also been strongly advocated. I have used it but little in the acute affection, although in the more chronic or subacute. In the when the disease has passed into an inactive stage and little remains chronic foim behind but the 'product of the inflammatory process, the treatment by pressure appears very valuable, indeed, more so than any with which I am acquainted; nothing tending more to hasten the absorption of the inflam- matory product. (Fig. 383.) Vidal’s plan of puncturiug the tunica va- ginalis or even the testis itself, has been freely practised by some English surgeons, and Mr. H. Smith speaks highly of its value. I have, however, never seen a case calling for so severe a measure. When tension exists an incision into the tunica vaginalis may be made with impunity, but I should hesitate to puncture the testicle unless sup- n puration were present. If mercury is ever needed in this affection, it is at the chronic stage, Pressure for as its power, doubtless, lies in its tendency to produce disintegra- with or :< tion of inflammatory products, so it prevents the organisation and subsequent contraction of such in and around the spermatic ducts which produces the special evil effects of epididymitis. When I have had occasion to use it, I have done so as an ointment applied with pressure to the part, but how far the good results which I have had : from the practice has been due to the pressure alone I am unable to say. Of late, I have been accustomed to employ simple pressure in these cases, and have no reason to believe my success has been less favourable than previously. If suppuration takes place as a consequence of epididymitis, a result which occasionally happens, it is well to open the abscess early, and i freely, as by such a practice the discharge finds easy vent, and the for- mation of sinuses is prevented. Water dressing to the part, and the use of the suspensory bandage are the best subsequent local means, while tonics and good living are generally required. On Acute Orchitis or Inflammation of the Seminal Gland. Orchitis or inflammation of the seminal gland as an acute affec* Oninflatnma- i tion, for the most part, occurs as the result of an injury, but appears ^0IJ of bo**y : at times spontaneously without any such cause, and more particularly ° ie es,lcle- i in connection with parotiditis or mumps. It may, too, be due to an extension of inflammation from the epididymis or spermatic duct, but it rarely, if ever, takes place as a primary affection in connection I with gonorrhoea. Acute orchitis may also attack the gland in its descent into the Orchitis of i scrotum, and the following case illustrates this fact:—Robert H nialpiaccd . rnt. 12, was brought to |me at Guy’s Hospital on June 20, 1859; and tesucle- as he walked into the room it was at once observed, that his body was ! bent unusually forward, and his movement much restrained. The j right testicle not having descended from the abdomen could not be felt, and the left had first shown itself at the external ring three days before the boy’s application. Pain in the groin, extended200 ORCHITIS. upwards towards the loin, having been experienced for two weeks pre- viously. The testicle, which had passed down the canal and partially through the external ring was about as big as an egg, and remark- ably tender-. The horizontal posture was ordered to be maintained, with the thigh flexed, and cold lotion or ice applied. In three days, the symptoms had somewhat abated, and at the end of the week, the swelling was much less. On July 11th, or the twenty-first day after coming under observation, the testicle had passed the external ring, although resting close to it in the scrotum. In another week, all pain had subsided; the testis was free, and the patient disappeared from observation, being quite well. Acute On August 16th, 1871,1 saw with Mr. Forman, of Stoke Newington, inflammation a boy, set. 14, with acute inflammation of the left testis, which was at uudescended tlie internal ring- Ifc was accompanied with such severe local and abdo- testis, minal pain, constipation, and vomiting, as to lead Mr. Forman to sus- simulating pect the presence of a hernia. I saw the patient with these symptoms, hernia. and an inflamed painful inguinal swelling the size of an egg, I explored it with a scalpel, and discovered the tunica vaginalis filled with pus and a small undeveloped testis. All the symptoms speedily subsided after the operation, and a good recovery ensued. Symptoms. The symptoms of acute orchitis are very marked and its diagnosis easy, for the rapid enlargement of the body of the gland, its flattened oval form, and extreme tenderness, are very characteristic. The patient will complain of its weight, and, if standing, will probably assume a bent posture. The disease will be accompanied by extreme local tenderness, and pain of a dull, aching character which passes up the loins, round the hips, and often down the thighs. The scrotum will probably manifest some symptoms of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, heat, and increased vascularity. In exceptional examples there will be some effusion of fluid into the tunica vaginalis, but this complication is not so common after acute orchitis as after epididy- mitis, for reasons which have been already given. The constitutional symptoms will be those of general irritative fever, and vary according to the susceptibility of the subject of the disease, in some cases being very severe, and in others less so. As a rule, it may also be asserted, that acute orchitis tends towards recovery and seldom terminates in suppuration, unless it be of the tubercular form, or affecting very cachectic patients. In one known example, it ended in gangrene of the part. This case was recorded by the late Mr. Harvey Ludlow in his unpublished Jacksonian prize essay. It was under the care of Mr. Stanley, who was induced to cut into the gland from the severity and obstinate character of the pain, and a black gangrenous cavity was exposed, which was seen after death to have occupied half the organ. I have the records of a case in which the patient stated that one testicle sloughed out after inflamma- tion six months previously; the man came under treatment for inflam- Glaml mation of the other. The termination by suppuration, however, occa- occasiomtlly sionally takes place, and numerous are the examples of this condition suppurates, -wliicli I possess. These cases may also at times end favourably, the abscess healing without any evil result, but too frequently the discharge of the abscess ends in what has been variously described as benign fungus of the testis, granular swelling, or hernia testis. The latter is the most correct and intelligible name, the affection being the result of201 ORCHITIS. rupture or ulceration of the tunica albuginea, and the gradual extru- , sion or hernia of the tubuli of the gland, the extruded gland being covered with granulations. The true nature of this affection was first described by Sir W. Lawrence in 1808, ‘ Edinburgh Med. and Surg. Journal,’ vol. iv, p. 257. Acute orchitis as a consequence of parotiditis or mumps is a well- Association recognised affection, although it may he difficult to explain the ^.orchitis connection between the two. It is described by some as a kind of ^j.0tiditia. metastasis, but there are no published facts tending to support this view; no one, however, being disposed to deny that the one affection occui’s in connection with the other. The disease is not usually r very severe, and commonly passes away with little treatment, ' leaving the testicle generally sound, few cases being recorded of atrophy of the glands attributable to this disease. The symptoms are precisely similar to those already described, and need no further illustration. Treatment of acute orchitis.—The ordinary principles of treatment Treatment, applicable to local inflammation in general are to be acted on in the treatment of this affection. Rest in the horizontal posture with elevation of the parts and warm fomentations are essential points for i observation; leeching the groin or local venesection, and saline pur- i gatives with sedatives are the chief remedies. The disease has a li tendency to get well by itself, and, unless badly treated or neg- v lected, or attacking very cachectic subjects, this will generally be u attained. In extremely severe examples when the inflammation runs l high, tartar emetic in full doses is a most valuable drug; while colclii- ,i cum, in half-draclnn doses of the wine, with saline purgatives, often acts like a charm. Opium in full doses may also be given where pain fi is severe, and constitutional disturbance great. An acute attack, how- i ever, generally runs its course in about ten days, and seldom ends otber- i wise than well. At other times, the local application of ice is most I beneficial. On Chronic Orchitis. Chrome inflammation is the most common of the true diseases of On chronic *j the seminal gland, and may follow the acute affection or an injury, orchitis, but most frequently it is induced by some special constitutional condition, such as gout, tuberculosis, and more particularly * syphilis. The general symptoms of chronic orchitis, from whatever cause, i are much alike, although they differ in some minor but import- l ant points. In the syphilitic affection, the symptoms are somewhat peculiar, and, as its diagnosis is important, it will receive special con- sideration. The subject will consequently be divided for consideration into the ordinary forms of chronic orchitis and syphilitic orchitis.

The general appearance also of the testicle, the subject of this affec- tion, is somewhat peculiar. It is not pyriform or globular as in hydro- cele and many other affections of the gland, but has a peculiar flattened outline from side to side, and a smooth even surface, unless the disease he associated with some effusion into the tunica vaginalis, when the tumour will naturally assume more the shape of a vaginal hy- drocele. But the simple affection is rarely associated with such a compli- cation, and when it is, the fluid, as a rule, is secreted in very small quantities. The epididymis in exceptional examples, from the exten- sion of the inflammation to its tissue may be slightly enlarged and thickened, but this never occurs to any great extent. There are, also, seldom any constitutional symptoms worthy of remark, except in cachectic and irritable patients, when the dull aching pain of the part may give rise to some general irritability of the patient’s condition, and an anxious expression of countenance. The pathology of this affection is that of chronic inflammation of any other part, and consists in a more or less general infiltration of the gland with an organisable or organised material, the inflam- matory effusion separating the secreting tubuli, and affecting them in ways determined by the amount of fibrin poured out between them and the amount of pressure to which they are subjected; the in- flammatory product in some cases being very generally diffused between the tubuli, while in others it is deposited in irregular masses. When the material poured out is very great, and equally diffused betweeu the meshes of the testis, i. e., when the disease is extensive or of long standing, that condition of the gland is probably produced which is indicated by an utter absence of the natural sensation of the organ on handling, or on firm pressure, and, under such circum- stances, there is the greatest anxiety for the subsequent maintenance of the integrity of the organ; though should the disease make a favourable progress towards recovery, and the inflammatory product be re-absorbed, the pressure will be proportionately removed from the delicate tubuli of the organ, and the natural testicular sensation be restored. If the inflammatory product soften down, as it will in the delicate and cachectic subject, suppuration will take place, and in propor- tion to its extent will be the liability to a hernia testis. Again, should this inflammatory product proceed to a more permanent organisation and contract, the delicate tubuli of the testicle will suffer in proportion to the extent of the part involved, and an atrophy of the organ be the result as a consequence. All these complications are met with in various degrees in practice, and with greater or less frequency, the general condition of the patient having a more important iuflueuce in determining the result even than the treatment; but I may add, that there are few affections which are more amenable to good treatment than that now under consideration. When the disease is remarkably insidious in its advance, slow in its progress, and painless in its character; when the patient is cachectic and irritable, with an anxious countenance, a disposition to a hot skin, and to other symptoms of constitutional irritation ; and, more203 SYPHILITIC ORCHITIS. particularly, when the disease ends in suppuration, as in all pro- bability it may when coming on and progressing in the manner just indicated, it is reasonable to believe that the organ is the seat of tuber- cular mischief, and that it disorganises as a result. . It must be added, too, that in these cases the tubercular affection is probably of the infiltrating or miliary tubercular form, and not of that crude nature which runs a different course, and to which attention will subsequently be directed. In gouty inflammation of the organ, the symptoms, as. a rule, are not so chronic as in the class of cases to which we have just alluded. Indeed they may more rationally he described as being of a subacute- nature, for though generally coming on slowly, they are mani- fested by greater local tenderness and pain—the pain being consi- derably aggravated at certain periods, and most probably at night. The disease has, moreover, a strong tendency towards recovery, and not towards disorganisation of the testis. Besides these symptoms, others indicating a gouty disposition will probably be present such as acidity of stomach, a loaded condition of the urine, and a more or less distinct history of gout. There will also be frequent nocturnal pains of a darting character in the opposite testicle, leading the patient to fear a double attack, and when these pains occur, they are valuable in connection with others as diagnostic symptoms. Symptoms and Diagnosis of Syphilitic Orchitis. That syphilitic inflammatory disease may attack the testicle as any other gland or texture of the body, within or without, seems at the present day a tolerably well-recognised pathological fact, and, the credit of bringing this subject clearly before the profession is largely due to my colleague, Dr. Wilks. I propose now to point out such symptoms as may aid in the recognition of syphilitic inflammation as affecting the seminal gland tissue. Before doing so it may be well briefly to consider in what way the syphilitic differs from other forms of inflammation, as such knowledge will help us to understand the local affection; and, fortu- nately, the points of difference are neither numerous nor deeply seated. The main one is palpable and apparent, for even to the most casual observer it is readily seen, that in all syphilitic inflammations, there is a marked tendency to the deposition of a product which rapidly undergoes fibrous changes, and tends to infiltrate the part affected with an organ- isable or organised material of a dense, firm, and fibrous structure. We see this in every tissue and in every stage of the disease. We see it manifesting itself primarily by the almost cartilaginous hardness of the base of the true infecting chancre; we see it in the early constitu- tional symptoms of syphilis, in the different eruptions, and in the greater permanency of them skin staining; in the different affections of the mucous membranes in all their parts; in the inflammation of the eye, cellular tissue, periosteum, and bone. The pathologist sees it, moreover, in the varied changes found after death in the internal organs of the syphilitic subject; and the surgeon sees it, likewise, in the inflammation of the testes. For in the subject of hereditary or acquired syphilis, the testicle may at some period of the disease, and generally at a late one, become the seat of a syphilitic inflammation, which manifests all the Gouty inflammation of testis.

The affection is essen- tially chronic, as much so as the other forms of chronic orchitis, but is almost invariably confined to the body of the gland, and rarely affects the spermatic duct. It is quite painless in its nature, local and general, the patient bearing free manipulation without flinching, and often thinking little about his disease except from the increased size of the organ. The special sensation of the gland usually disappears at a very early stage of the disease, and there is rarely any constitutional dis- turbance accompanying its progress. It may or may not be associated with other symptoms of constitutional syphilis, but usually appears alone. The disease manifests itself locally in a special manner which claims attention. It usually affects the body of the testis and both testes at different periods of its progress, though rarely at the same time. It is almost always complicated by the presence of a vaginal hydrocele which at times increases to a considerable size, and much more so than in other forms of chronic orchitis. The most characteristic point of all, however, is the remarkably stony induration of the gland and its peculiar, irregular, nodular outline; small fibrous projections being distinctly visible from the body of the gland in some cases, while in others, loose bodies are felt in the tunica vaginalis. In the majority of cases this disease terminates by resolution, and apparently leaves the gland intact; although in many, a gradual wasting of the testicle is the result, which ends in atrophy, and, as a con- sequence, in sterility. In exceptional cases, suppuration with or with- out hernia testis may take place. The disease, too, when appa- rently cured, has a remarkable disposition to return on the slightest provocation. The Treatment of Chronic Orchitis, — There are few affections more ame nable to treatment than chronic orchitis, especially when taken early; and there are none which better prove the value of pressure and mercurials in procuring the absorption and disinte- gration of inflammatory products. In the common as well as in the syphilitic orchitis this opinion holds good; but, in the gouty, the treatment must be modified according to the special peculiarity of the patient. In a healthy subject with good powers and an unbroken constitution, any form of mercurial may be administered such as blue pill in four-grain doses, mercurial inunction, the oleate of mercury or the percliloride; but as the object of the surgeon is neither to salivate nor to bring the patient rapidly under the influence of the remedy, but rather to procure a lengthened and equal action of the drug upon the local disease, the dose should be carefully regulated. In my hands, the iodide of mercury given in one-grain doses, with five grains of Dover s powder twice a day, or the mercurial suppository has proved eminently beneficial, the testicle being well strapped up by common soap plaster. (See Fig. 383.) In a more cachectic patient in whom mercury may still be tolerated, the same treatment may be employed, though in smaller doses; and in others, the mercurial may be locally applied in the form of an ointment, or as an oleate dissolved in oleic acid in the proportion of five per cent. During this time tonics, such as quinine and iron, may be administered, as well as good living and fresh air \n certain examples, however, occurring in cachectic patients, it mayCHRONIC ORCHITIS. 205 not seem desirable to administer mercurials in any shape, and, under such circumstances, iodine may he substituted in the form of the iodide iodide of of potassium iu three or four-grain doses, gradually increased to ten or potassium, twelve, combined with half-drachm doses of the syrup of the iodide of iron in infusion of quassia, three times a day. Locally, strapping, or rather pressure, should still be enforced. In hospital practice, this treat- ment has been of great value; by it, steadily persevered in for six or eight weeks, even the worst of cases may be expected to yield, the organ gradually becoming softer and more natural in sensation and shape, and at last resuming its normal condition. In the gouty form of orchitis which can he recognised or sus- pected by the symptoms already quoted, the administration of col- Colchicum. chicum is very beneficial. It should be given in small doses, and continued for several weeks. The acetic extract in half-grain doses, with Dover’s powder is the best form, and with it a cure may generally be guaranteed. This form of disease is easily reduced when early recognised. It is more liable, however, than other forms to relapses, but less so to disorganisation and subsequent atrophy. If there be sudden accessions of pain in the part, with other evidences of some fresh inflammatory attack, the application of a few leeches with hot fomentations is very serviceable, but these conditions are uncommon. When vaginal hydrocele co-exists with the inflamed gland—a fre- Attend to quent complication of the syphilitic variety—it is a good practice to hydrocele, draw off the fluid, to enable the surgeon to apply his pressure with more certainty and better effect. It is of no use to attempt to cure the hydrocele itself, as it must be remembered that the hydrocele is the direct consequence of the diseased testis, and £hat it is of little use to treat the effect of a diseased condition and not its cause. Remove the latter, and the former will probably disappear; cure the orchitis, and the hydrocele will generally depart. I have the records of a case which passed under my care for treat- ment, where by some oversight this attempt had been made, and the hydrocele was tapped and injected with iodine ou three different occa- sions, without success. Under the subsequent treatment, the chronic orchitis disappeared, and with it the hydrocele. It is not always desirable, nor is it possible in a large proportion of Rest, cases, to keep the patient absolutely at rest during the process of treatment. In some it is advisable to do so as much as possible, particularly when the patient experiences more pain and inconve- nience when walking or moving about, but, in the majority of cases, it is sufficient to keep the parts well supported by an elastic bandage or strapping. In the consideration of the treatment of chronic orchitis it has been stated, that a good recovery may generally be secured by the means which have been suggested, when the disease has been taken in hand at an early period of its existence; that is, when not more than five or six weeks have been allowed to elapse. But in case of longer stand- p , ing, the prognosis is not so favourable either as regards the removal ch™on£81S ° of the disease, or the subsequent integrity of the part as a seminal 01'cl“bs. gland. These remarks apply more particularly to the syphilitic form of the affection: for, if of long standing, the fibrinous matterTUBERCULAR DISEASE OF THE TESTICLE. 206 has generally become too well organised for future absorption, and when this is the case, the subsequent contraction of the organised product will almost to a certainty go on to the destruction of the seminiferous tubuli, and an atrophy of the gland. In Guy’s Hos- pital Museum are several admirable specimens exhibiting this result. Again, in certain examples of chronic orchitis, whether syphilitic or otherwise, suppuration and disintegration of the gland structure will take place. This termination may be suspected when the disease is of a very torpid character, the pain of a constant aching kind, and when all treatment fails to influence its course. Pus depots to When pus has formed, its early evacuation is the best practice, as be opened, a clean incision or puncture into the part often prevents that destruc- tion of the glandular structure and its fibrous covering which usually precedes that troublesome affection, hernia testis. On Tubercular Disease of the Testicle. On tubercular disease of testis. of miliary tubercle, Tubercular disease of the testicle may attack any part of the organ —that is, either the seminal gland or its duct—or it may affect these parts separately or together. It may show itself either in the form of an infiltration of the so-called miliary tubercles, or in the more distinct When in form an(^ usual condition of the yellow, cheesy, unorganisable material de- 1 scribed as crude tubercle. When it appears in the form of miliary tubercle, it is not characterised by any very definite symptoms; indeed the infiltration of a gland with those small, grey, miliary bodies seldom makes itself known by any outward visible signs, and their presence should be suspected only when a rapid disorganisation of the part takes place, after an attack of acute or chronic inflammation. Organs thus infiltrated have no power of resisting the inflammatory process, and, whether it be a lung or a testicle which is the seat of this affection, active breaking up of tissue with suppuration generally ensues. I shall exclude from present consideration those interesting cases, remembering that pathologically they are clearly to be recognised, while practically their presence can only be suspected when the result to which I have already alluded takes place. The other form of tubercular testis is characterised by more special symptoms and local conditions. It may involve, as already stated, either the body of the gland or the epididymis, but, doubt- less, the latter is the more frequently diseased. It is generally discovered accidentally by the patient, and frequently not until some secondary change in the structure is about to show itself. It appears primarily as an indolent, painless enlargement of the epi- didymis, and is described usually by the patient as a lump in the testicle, this lump appearing generally at the upper part. This symptom, in all probability, is the only one to which attention can be drawn, and the surgeon will recognise it at once on manipulation, for the tubercular matter will feel as if some foreign body, as a pea, bean, or nut, had been placed between the convolutions of the epididymis, or in the substance of the gland. The gland is not painful on pressure, nor in its inactive stage does the disease seem to cause any injurious influence on the organ, which is otherwise natural in its sensation and function. In other cases, the disease will appear as a general infiltration of the When in form of crude tubercle.

If the body of the gland be the part affected, like symptoms will be present, although the enlargement will show itself as a uniform or nodulated expansion of the secreting structure; the epididymis, or seminal duct, being quite distinct. This inactivity of the disease, however, does not remain always. May be though it may last months, or even years—but the time will come, when lnactlve- the tubercular matter, in all probability, will soften down, and thus May soften excite some increased action in the parts around. It may be that this down, increased action in the part will first draw the patient’s attention to his affection, when the history of some previous thickening of the organ will for the first time be obtained. When inflammatory symptoms May inflame are once developed, the disease will certainly make rapid progress, and and disintegration of this nnorganisable tubercular matter accompanied suPPurate- by suppuration will speedily follow. In tubercular epididymitis—for such this disease may be named— where local suppuration will soon appeal’, with the discharge of ill-formed affecting pus and debris, as a curdy, friable, and granular material; and after epididymitis, this, sinuses are apt to form, which may go on discharging for a period, depending on the extent of the disease, and the amonnt of foreign material existing to disintegrate and soften. If the body of the testicle be the part implicated, the same Where gradual softening and suppuration will take place, but too often affecting it will be followed by the formation of the hernia testis to which testicle- allusion has been already made. It is not, moreover, in every case of this disease of the testis that disintegration of the tubercular material is to be expected, with its accompanying suppuration and abscess; for in many examples, no such result can be found, this tubercular matter undergoing a gradual change, and showing itself after death as an earthy concretion. The same changes take place in the testicle as is seen in the absorbent glands, the lungs, and other parts. Tubercular disease of the testis may occur at any age, but is May occur at more common in adult life. The best example that I have seen was in a child, aged two years, whose testicle I excised for disease of six months’ standing, which had pro- gressed very slowly and acquired a large size before suppuration occurred. Con- valescence followed the operation. (Fig. 380.) The whole organ, with the epididymis, was nearly filled with scrofulous de- posit. It is in the testicle that we have the best „ opportunity of examining ernia 0 e following tubercular the true tubercular disease sease' any age.

Treatment of tubercular disease of the testicle.—When tuber- cular material has been once deposited in a testicle as in any other tissue, there are no recognised means by which the absorption of this material can be procured. It is true that it may remain in an inactive or passive condition for an indefinite period, and finally, by under- going an earthy degeneration, cease to trouble; nevertheless, it will still exist, ready as it were, on the least disturbance, to light up some inflammatory action in the tissues around, and to give rise to any or all of the various conditions just described. Looking also upon, the deposition of tubercle in a testicle as only one of the local manifestations of that general condition described as tuberculosis, it is clear, that the principles of treatment should be of a general character to improve the health and revive the powers of the patient by tonics, good living, good air, regular habits, and, what is of great impoi’tance, total abstinence from sexual excitement or gratifica- tion. Indeed the parts should be maintained as much as possible in a quiet condition, and for this purpose, cold sponging night and morning is of some service. When inflammatory symptoms make their appearance, they will generally run their course in spite of treatment; for, as already shown, they are usually caused by the breaking down of the tubercular deposit, and may be looked upon as one of nature’s means for its elimination ; indeed, until this material has been discharged, their subsidence is not usually to be expected; fomentations in this stage and the applica- tion of water dressing to the part are, therefore, suitable, while support in a suspensory bandage, should be resorted to. When suppu- ration is nigh at hand or has manifested itself, it is good practice to open the abscess freely with a lancet, as it saves time and pain to the patient and often prevents the formation of the sinuses which prove so troublesome. During all this time the health of the patient must be attended to by ordinary measures. When the gland has attained a large size and is evidently destroyed by abscesses and disintegration of the infiltrating material, it may be excised, and more particularly if hernia testis has appeared and the disorganised testis is a source of trouble and weakness to an enfeebled patient. On Hernia Testis. This affection, which has been variously described as “granular swelling,” and “benign fungus of the testis,” has also more cor- rectly been called “ hernia testis,” for it is essentially a gradual pro- trusion of the substance of the gland through a rupture or ulceration of its fibrous envelope, the tunica albuginea. It may follow upon suppuration of the body of the gland the result of an injury, or of an acute or chronic orchitis, or from the softening down of tubercular deposit. It seems to be the result of pressure produced by the natural elasticity of the fibrous tunica albuginea; the testicle, as it were, being gradually squeezed out of its capsule and everted, the mass being eventually increased by the free granulations which spring up on its surface. The whole organ, or only a portion of it, may thus be extruded from its natural position, the extent varying according to the amount of disease and the size of the opening in the tunica albuginea andHEKNIA TESTIS. 209 integuments. It must not be supposed, however, that this hernia testis is the necessary consequence of suppuration or of disorganization of any portion of the gland, for such is not the case. In the majority of instances it does not ensue, though in some it is certainly found, and in such requires consideration. The diagnosis is not difficult, and the disease having been once Diagnosis, seen subsequently can be readily made out. It is a peculiar fuu- gating-looking growth with everted edges and a sinus in its centre generally secreting pus. It is of variable extent, and presents a more or less irregular surface and a pedunculated base, the pedicle passing through an opening in the scrotum to the remains of the testicle. The margin of the opening in the scrotum is generally free, although in some cases adherent to the growth. It may be slightly indurated from inflammatory thickening, but will never present the same aspect as a cancerous growth, for which, however, this affec- tion may be mistaken, the term “fungous testis ” having doubtless been the means of encouraging the great error of regarding this simple disease as malignant. The natural sensation of the gland remains, however, in these cases, and will be readily excited by manipulation, whereas in cancerous disease, no such natural sensation exists, and, in doubtful cases this point is one of primary importance. Treatment of hernia testis.—It may be safely stated that the ma- Treatment of jority of cases of hernia testis can be successfully treated by other less lierili“ testis, severe measures than castration, although this operation has been very generally performed for this affection. In exceptional intances it may be demanded, and I have the records of many in which it has been successfully performed. The surgeon’s object, it may be briefly stated is, to restore the extruded testicle to its natural place, which may frequently be done by simple pressure applied by fixing a good firm [pad over the surface of the growth and drawing the margin of Pressure, the ulcerated scrotum well forward, fixing the whole in position by strapping. In other cases, where the granulations are very exuberant, caustics may be used to hasten their destruction; and among the best is the red oxide of mercury, pressure being well maintained during U«1 oxide of its use. All minor cases, and many of the severe, may' certainly be mercury cured by these means, if steadily pursued and well applied. In the c,lustic8- more obstinate and severe examples other measures must be adopted. The excision of the surface of the growth was formerly employed, and Excision is occasionally in the present day, but the practice at best, is a very deprecated, doubtful one, for in the majority of cases to which it is applicable it would be tantamount to castration, as the fungating mass is, as a rule, composed of the everted tubules of the testis, covered with granula- tions, and consequently, by this measure, the tubules would be cut off and the gland destroyed. Mr. Syme described in the * London and Edinburgh Monthly Syme’s Journal’ for January, 1845, a plan of treatment which in these °Peration- cases is very serviceable, although it is only in quite exceptional examples that it can be called for. The operation consists in the elevation of the margin of the scrotum from the protruding mass, the reduction of the hernia testis within the scrotum, and the re- tention of the part in its natural position by a stitching together of the margins of the wound, careful bandaging and strapping being also required in the treatment of these cases. The granulating organ VOL. ii. 14210 CYSTIC DISEASE OP THE TESTICLE. becomes attached to the inner surface of the scrotum, and a healthy action is subsequently restored. It is almost needless to add, that a local and constitutional treatment for the original affection of the testis should at the same time be maintained. On cystic disease of testis. Curling’s views. disease. On Cystic Disease of the Testicle. There is no affection of the testicle on the nature of which there has been a greater difference of opinion than cystic disease, and although modern pathologists have devoted considerable attention to its investigation, the subject has not yet been brought out of its obscurity and made plain to the profession. Sir A. Cooper, one of its original enquirers, looked upon it as a distinct disease of the secreting tubuli of the organ, and upon his authority, this view was for a time generally received. More recently, Mr. Curling’s researches have tended to prove it to be an affection of the ducts of the testicle, and not of its secreting tubuli. “ Wliy they alone,” says Mr. Curling, “ are subject to the morbid change, I admit my inability to explain.” Whether this opinion be correct or not will be one of the subjects for present consideration; since I am disposed to think, that it is not quite consistent with observed facts, although there can be no doubt that the rete testis appears to be the seat of the disease in certain cases, while in exceptional examples, cystic disease is undoubtedly formed independent of this structure. It has been my privilege to examine many examples of this rare affection with some care, and I entirely concur in the main points of' Mr. Curling’s investigations although I am not so sure of the Nature of the special seat of the disease as he appears to' be. It is doubtless made up of cysts which are multilocular and of sizes varying from that of a mustard seed to a moderate-sized nut. (Fig. 381.) These cysts are filled with a thin, serous, blood-stained, or glairy fluid, and at times with more or less pedunculated Pig. 381. intra-cystic growths made up of a deli- cate cellular struc- ture, or of a distinct cells tisue. These cysts appear embed- ded in a fibrous stroma of different degrees of consis- tency and density— the fibrous elements in some being much more numerous than in others. Whilst in some again it will be of a more delicate nature, and more al- lied to the fibre structure found in the ordinary fibro- plastic growths of Cystic disease of the testicle. other parts. In cer-211 CYSTIC DISEASE OP THE TESTICLE. tain examples, the cysts are clearly made up of dilated tubes with pouches at their extremities, or, as lateral dilatations—these tubes being occasionally lined, as Mr. Curling was the first to observe, with tesselated epithelium and containing granular matter. I have failed, Varieties in however, to find this in all the cases I have examined, and am disposed t to look upon the presence of this tesselated epithelium as specially characterising a certain growth. Spermatozoa are invariably absent in the cysts or tubes of this affection, while cartilage or bone elements will almost always be fouud to exist either as small isolated patches or as filling the cyst, when the growth might be described as an enchondro- matous tumour, the cartilage being deposited in separate masses, and these masses being divided by a fibrous stroma. The true secreting portion of the testicle will often be found pushed up into some corner of the tumour, spread out over the cystic mass, or distributed between the cysts themselves, the tumour being invariably encysted in its own capsule; although, in rare cases, tumours of this nature will be found upon the cord and body of the testicle. The above facts, therefore, lead me to conclude that the majority of these are new growths follow- ing the great law which governs the development of all tumours, by taking on the likeness of the part in which they are developed, and that they are more or less built up as is the structure of the normal gland. The testis being essentially a tubular organ, all morbid growths developed in or near it have a tendency to assume a tubular or cystic character, this character varying in extent in different cases; the cystic or tubular and fibrous or fibro-plastic structure being found in dif- ferent degrees of perfection and quantity in different cases. We may thus find in the testicle, a tumour presenting all the Fibrous ami elements of the fibrous or fibro-plastic tumour without cysts, whilst in fibro-plastic another, in which the cystic formation more or less predominates, the tumours- same elements will exist in smaller proportions; and, in the majority of these examples, the true structure of the testicle will be found spread out to a variable extent over the special capsule of the new growth. In other cases, the new growth will be altogether free from any connection with the testis itself, and be found growing from the cord. All these separate kinds of tumours, examples of which may be seen in Guy's Museum, appear to me merely modifications of one kind of growth—the simple, or perhaps more correctly, adenoid growth of testis. We thus see a close analogy between these tumours of the testis and Analogy those of the mammary gland, as well as of the ovary, and find in all between the simple adenoid tumour partaking more or less of the nature of WaT^ the gland in which it is developed; and a also true cystic disease of testicles" the gland itself, the latter being evidently a special affection of the tubes and ducts of the mammary gland or testis, and not of the secreting structure. In both organs they are new growths, simulating more or less correctly, the anatomical structure of the true gland ° Symptoms and diagnosis. Haying described the special pathology of this disease, I pass on to Symptoms ot consider its clinical aspect, as well as to point out the symptoms which c*stic diaeasc indicate its presence, and help the formation of a correct diagnosis In °f tcst‘3' doing so I must premise, that the several forms of this cystic disease are to be recognised more by negative than by positive signs, since they ap- pear usually as painless enlargements of the organ, are of slow growth212 CANCER OF THE TESTICLE. and unaccompanied by any such symptoms as attract attention—the patient, indeed, seldom seeking advice until the organ has become troublesome from its size, or the dragging pain in the loins excites anxiety, which always exists when the testicle has become large and heavy from any cause. The testis soon loses its natural shape, and assumes more the oval or pyriform outline of a vaginal hydrocele or hsematocele. It will probably have a smooth and equal surface, and he indistinctly fluctuating, though not translucent; while its natural sensation experienced on manipulation will most likely have disap- Differential peared at a very early stage of the disease. The general health of diagnosis. the patient may probably he good, and there will be no evidence of any secondary glandular affection. By these conditions the disease may generally he recognised, the history of the case, the opacity of the tumour, and the loss of the natural testicular sensation, distinguishing it from hydrocele and hmmatocele; and when doubt exists, an explora- tory puncture by the trocar and canula will decide the point, for in cystic disease a little bloody and glairy fluid will alone escape. From the inflammatory affections it may be diagnosed by the difference in the shape and feel of the tumour, for in the different forms of orchitis the organ maintains its flattened form from side to side, feeling hard, nodulated, and tender. In the cystic disease, the tumour is generally more or less globular or pyriform, smooth, elastic, and without the peculiar testicular sensation. The inflammatory affections are also often associated with a hydrocele, and the cystic but rarely, if ever. In the former, also, both organs are generally affected sooner or later; while in the latter, the disease only attacks one. Medical treatment does not appear to have any influence in arresting the development of the cystic, whilst in the inflammatory disease a good recovery may generally be secured by the use of proper remedies. Treatment of Treatment of cystic disease. cystic There is hut one remedy, which is the removal of the diseased organ. No drugs seem to have the slightest effect in diminishing its size or arresting its growth. Excision, therefore, should be performed, the operation being, as a rule, most successful. On Cancer of the Testicle. On cancer of qqie testicle, like all glands, may become the seat of cancerous the testis. ,Jisease, both of the carcinoma-fibrosum or hard cancer, and of the carcinoma-medullare or soft cancer. It is rare, however, for the hard cancer to attack the testis, the majority of examples being of the soft or encephaloid form. For one example of the hard cancer it is probable that at least twenty of the soft are met with in practice. In the different museums a few specimens of the former kind may be seen, and at Guy’s several exist. Tuberous Cancer may also attack this organ in two forms, either as the tuberous form. or the infiltrating cancer. In the former, the disease appears either as an isolated growth, or as several distinct tumours separating the parts and then eventually coalescing into one mass; in the latter, it appears from the beginning as the infiltrating kind, the cancerous elements Infiltrating being more equally distributed between the tubes and ducts of the true lorm' secreting gland tissue. The malignant affections of the organ, as the simple, are accom- panied by the development of cysts, and these, in the malignant cases,213 CANCER OP THE TESTICLE. are filled with cancerous matter in lieu of the glairy mucous or fibro- cellular intra-cystic growths which are found in the fibro-plastic, adenoid, or cystic diseases. In rare examples, both conditions seem to co-exist in the same organ; simple cysts, with the clear or blood-stained glairy fluid, being found in one portion, whilst in others, these cysts are filled with cancerous material, and in a third, enchondromatous masses may at times be present. (Fig. 382.) The part of the organ generally attacked is the body of the gland, although the epididymis may be the seat of the disease; hut when the latter is involved, as a rule, it is an extension of the disease from the Fig. 382. Cancer of the testicle. body of the tumour. Rare examples, however, exist which illustrate a primary affection of the epididymis. Cancer may attack the testis of the old as well as of the young, Aze. and I have the records of cases occurring in men aged 56 and 62, re- spectively. Instances of this disease attacking infants even so young as seven months have likewise been recorded by different authors, and I have excised a cancerous testicle from a boy only two years old. The majority of cases occur, however, in young adult life, from 25 to 40 years of age, as is indicated by the following facts. I possess the records of twenty-five cases, which I have added below to Statistics of the fifty-one examples originally tabulated by Mr. Harvey Ludlow, in »ge- his Jacksonian prize essay.

Out of my 25 cases the disease in 20 had been growing for one year or less, and in the remaining 5 cases two were of three years, two of four, and one of five years standing. It is rare, if not unknown, for both testicles to be the seat of cancer at the same time. I am not aware of any such example being on record. In 16 out of the 25 cases before me, the right organ was attacked, and in 9 the left. Mal-placed testicles appear to be particularly prone to this disease. Cancer of the testicle may come on as insidiously as the simple cystic disease, but in general its growth is more rapid. It makes its appearance as a gradual enlargement of the body of the organ, seldom attended by pain. There is also an early loss on pressure or manipulation of the special testicular sensation. The outline of the tumour is smooth, semi-elastic, and fluctuating, but as the disease progresses, its surface may become somewhat uneven or irregularly bossy, the tumour being harder in some parts than in others, the softer parts projecting. In the carcinoma fibrosum, however, the whole tumour is hard and at times nodular. The tumour is opaque from the beginning, and rarely, if ever, associated with hydrocele, and when so, it is by chance, the one affection having no direct relation to the other. In this respect, cancer differs from inflammation of the organ, which is very frequently complicated by the presence of hydro- cele. The disease rarely extends beyond its fibrous covering or involves the scrotum ; and for a bleeding fungus to form, the tumour must be very large. As the disease progresses, the health of the patient may suffer, and a general aspect indicative of exhaustion and some wasting disease appear, although it is not till a late period of this affection that any such symptoms are to be expected. When lumbar pain or a constant aching exists, a suspicion of enlarged lumbar glands should be excited, and, in certain examples, a chain of enlarged glands may be felt extending upwards along the psoas muscle. The inguinal glands are occasionally enlarged from infiltration, though it is believed by some, that this complication does not appear till the scrotum is involved in the disease. This, however, is certainly not the case, for large inguinal glands may appear at an early stage. The diagnosis of this disease is by no means easy, particularly in its early stage, indeed, in many instances, it is almost impossible to be certain of its nature. It is the size of the organ which generally first draws the attention of the patient to the part; and the pain and inconvenience caused by its weight which prompt him to seek advice. The history of the case and the absence of translucency will prevent its being mistaken for a hydrocele. Hsematocele, as a rule, has a distinct and special history of its own, and the fact that the testis may be made out to exist in some portion of the tumour is a material aid to the surgeon in forming a correct opinion as to the nature of the case. The tenderness of the organ, the nature of the pain, and the shape of the swelling, are sufficient to indicate the inflammatory affection, and w'hen fluid exists, the diagnosis is rendered more plain, since a vaginal hydrocele rarely co-exists with any other disease than the inflammatory, except to a very slight extent. The simple cystic disease is of slower growth than the cancerous.215 DIAGNOSIS OF A SCROTAL TUMOUR. and generally firmer to the feel; when punctured, it yields also a glairy From cystic fluid unlike the creamy material which comes away from the cancerous dlseaae' disease. The subject of diagnosis of all these growths will, however, be discussed hereafter. Treatment.—The only treatment which gives any comfort to the Treatment, patient is excision of the organ, and this should be done as early as the diagnosis can be made, for there is then less chance of the glands in the loin becoming involved. The general health must also be attended to with great care at the same time. On the Diagnosis of Scrotal Tumours. I propose now to consider the subject of the diagnosis of scrota] General tumours as a whole, to describe the train of thought which passes of through the surgeon’s mind when examining such a case with diagnostic gc'rbtal intentions, and to point out the special symptoms or their combination, tumours, as they tend to indicate the presence of any special affection. In doing this, I believe that a near approximation to truth may generally be made, when the history of the case and its special symptoms are carefully weighed. Great difficulty may occasionally be experienced in any given case, or it may be beyond our power to form any positive opinion upon its nature, but I am not disposed, on that account, to place among impossibilities the diagnosis of a scrotal tumour. There are gradations of probability in all our conclusions as to the diagnosis of any disease, and a certainty untainted by fallacy or doubt is rarely obtained; but I take it, we are as often correct in our judgment of a scrotal tumour as of any other affection. To aid the student in this task the following table has been drawn up. (Pp. 216, 217.) The first point the surgeon has to decide on being consulted as to Is it a the nature of a scrotal tumour has reference to the question of hernia, hernia ? Is the tumour connected with the testicle ? or has it passed down the direction of the cord from the abdominal cavity ? If the surgeon is able to isolate’the growth at its neck from the abdominal cavity by the thumb and finger, the question is at once decided, for almost all scrotal tumours can be so isolated, it being quite exceptional for any to pass up the cord so far as the internal ring. Rare cases of vaginal hydrocele, or hsematocele, however, in which the tunica vaginalis is open up to the internal ring form an exception. It being determined that the swelling is not a hernia, the nature of the tumour next claims attention. Is it a hydrocele or hsematocele ? Is it the product of inflammation is it a or of tubercular disease ? Is it a new growth altogether, and if so, is hydrocele or it innocent in its nature or malignant ? luematocele ? If the tumour prove translucent by transmitted light, the exist- Translucent ence of a hydrocele is fairly decided; but, then, is it an ordinary tumours, vaginal hydrocele, or encysted ? Should the tumour be large, even, and pyriform, and the testis be found, at the posterior part of the tumour either by means of manipulation or by the opacity displayed at one spot on transmitting light, vaginal hydrocele may be suspected; but should the testis exist in front or at one side, and the tumour have' been of very slow growth, small, and more or less globular or evidently multilocular, a cystic hydrocele may probably be diagnosed. The tapping of the tumour will, hbwever, settle the diagnosis; for in vaginal hydrocele the fluid will be more or less straw-coloured andTABLE OP DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC | Symptoms. Hydrocele.

Cystic disease. albuminous, while in the encysted, it will be thin, non-albuminous, pale, and probably opalescent, containing on microscopical examination, granules and spermatozoa. In rare or old instances, however, the tumour may be opaque, and under such circumstances, difficulties may be experienced; yet the history of these cases will tend to throw much light upon the point, for to a certainty it will reveal a disease of very long standing; the tumour will be probably painless and fluctuating, and the testis made out to be in its usual position at the posterior part of the sac. When a doubt exists, a puncture with an exploring trocar and canula will decide the question, as in these cases, fluid will be drawn off of a dark colour, loaded with cholesterine. We will now pass on to the consideration of tumours which are not translucent and not hydrocele, and it is here that the surgeon experi- ences true difficulty in his diagnosis, as almost all the diseases of the testis are insidious in their growth, and chiefly painless in their development. . The haematocele, except in rare examples, usually follows upon some strain or injury, increasing with tolerable rapidity up to a certain point, and accompanied by pain which soon subsides. It then becomes stationary as to size, and remains torpid for a variable period, when pain reappears with other signs of inflammation. The presence of the testis is also to be made out by manipulation towards the posterior part of the organ. The surface of the tumour is always smooth, more or less oval or pyriform, and semi-elastic or fluctuating. The inflammatory affections of the testis have a peculiar shape, being laterally flattened, and are usually accompanied at some period of their course with tenderness and pain, as well as often associated with fluid in the tunica vaginalis. In the syphilitic inflammation, this fluid is often copious. Both organs are also generally involved, either together or at different times. The tumour is usually somewhat tender to the touch and has a firm fibrous feel unlike the semi-elastic and half-fluctuating sensations afforded by cystic or carcinomatous disease. In very chronic cases the testis may, however, be perfectly painless, and allow of any amount of manipulation without distress; the natural testicular sensation also having disappeared. In syphi- litic disease, the surface of the tumour will probably be irregular, with firm fibrous outgrowths in different parts and in the tunica albuginea. In the tubercular affection of the epididymis or testis there should not be any difficulty in the diagnosis, for the tubercular deposit, as a rule, takes place unaccompanied by pain or any symptom beyond that produced by its deposition. When deposited in masses,— its usual form,—it feels like some foreign body introduced into the substance of the gland or of the epididymis ; and is at first quite painless and unproductive of any symptoms, these only appearing when the mate- rial begins to soften down and excite some inflammatory action in the parts around. The tubercular material may be deposited in one or more masses, these subsequently, perhaps, coalescing into an irre- gular induration. When suppuration takes place, the diagnosis is complete. . . , ,, , The cystic or simple tumours of the testis are painless throughout the whole course of their growth, and can be recognised by purelyCASTRATION. 219 negative symptoms. They attract the patient’s observation only from their size, can be handled without exciting pain, and do not usually give even the natural sensation of the organ upon pressure. They are slow in their progres, uniform in their outline, and more or less globular ; are always confined to one gland; are rarely accompanied with fluid in the tunica vaginalis; and, on being punctured, emit only a more or less blood-stained glairy mucus. The cancerous tumours of the organ are more rapid in their develop- ^"^g0118 inent than the cystic, a year’s growth, as a rule, giving a large tumour. They are likewise painless, and readily allow of free manipulation. The natural sensation of the organ also soon disappears. They are unac- companied with a hydrocele, and also involve only one organ. They have a more elastic and fluctuating feel than the cystic or the inflammatory enlargements, and when their outline is unequal or bossy, the projection is generally softer than the other portion of the tumour. An exploring needle, or trocar and canula, rarely, if ever, reveals the mucoid fluid so characteristic of the cystic or simple affections, but usually lets out blood or the thin creamy fluid so charac- teristic of a cancer. In the preceding table, the chief points of dif- ference in the several chronic affection of the testicles are clearly shown. (See Table, pp. 216, 217.) Castration. The scrotum having been shaven, and the skin over the testicle made On tense, a free incision is to be made through the scrotum and tunica castration, vaginalis down to the tunica vaginalis testis, and the body of the organ with its cord exposed; and, when any doubt as to diagnosis exists, an incision should be made into the growth before its removal. A strong silk or carbolised catgut ligature should then be passed through the cord, which must be firmly tied in halves; the cord divided below the ligature, and the tumour turned out of its scrotal covering. There is no necessity to take away any of the scrotum however stretched, unless diseased, since it is sure to contract. All vessels are to be twisted, the wound washed out with some iodine water and dried, and a few sutures put in at the upper part of the wound, the purse being raised when the patient is in bed by a small pillow. No pain is caused when the ligature of the cord has been tightly tied, and about the tenth „ day it will come away. To take the vessels of the cord up singly is a troublesome operation and has no advantages. No assistant can hold the cord with his fingers be- fore its division, as it is sure to slip from his grasp. To strap a testicle re- quires some skill. The patient should be made to stand against the edge of a table and separate his legs. The surgeon should then with his left hand grasp the organ from behind and press it down to the bottom of the scrotal sac, making the220 MALPOSITION OF TESTICLES. Malposition of testis. Arrest of descent. Treatment. May be the seat of disease. scrotum tense over its surface, the thumb aud index-finger of his left hand holding its neck. A piece of elastic strapping spread on leather, half an inch or more wide, is next to be wound round the neck of the tumour once, twice, or even thrice to hold it in position, for if this point be not attended to, all the subsequent steps will be useless. (Fig. 383.) Having done this, pieces of strapping three quarters of an inch long are to be applied vertically from one side of the circular strip to the other, sufficient force being employed to compress the organ. When the testis is completely covered in and compressed, another circular piece or so should be applied to keep the whole in position, and to bind down the ends of the vertical pieces. The strapping will probably require re-application every second day as the parts soon yield, and the strapping then forms a loose bag. The student must remember that the object of the strapping is to compress the organ, aud not to cover it. Imperfect transition and malposition of the testicle is occasionally met with, the organ being either arrested in some part of its course into its scrotal pouch, or, misplaced. At times one testicle is found in the canal, or it has failed to put in an appearance at all; while at others both are found to be out of place. Not uncommonly, this arrested descent of the testicle is complicated with a congenital hernia, the vaginal pro- cess of peritoneum being still open, and in all cases of scrotal swelling in infants, the surgeon should examine the parts with care to discover whether the testicle is or is not involved in the tumour. When the testes are thus placed, they are very commonly ill developed. At times during their descent through the rings, they are nipped by the muscular structures, and become inflamed. I have recorded such instances in a former page. Nothing can be done by way of treat- ment to expedite the descent of the organ. When within the internal ring and complicated with hernia, it is well to recommend a truss; but when the testis is in the canal, such an instrument cannot be worn, an extra element of danger, under these circumstances, being added to the case. Testes so situated seem to be Fig. 384. very prone to become the seat of cancerous disease. Many such cases have been recorded. In a case under my care, of a gentleman over fifty, an encysted hydrocele was found with a small testicle situated in the centre of a congenital hernia, the cyst ap- pearing on the reduction of the hernia as a tumour the size of a small orange, below the ex- ternal ring and behind the hernia. I tapped it from behind, and drew off about two ounces of a milky fluid containing many spermatozoa, and injected it with iodine. A good result followed. This gentleman was married, and Right testicle iu the perimeum. had a family.221 VARICOCELE. Malplaced testicles are less common than those just described. I Malplaced have, however, seen seven cases; in three, one of which I have reported testes. (‘ Guy’s Hosp. Reports,’ 1867), the right testicle was placed in the peri- nmum in its own independent scrotal pouch (Fig. 384), and in the other four the right testicle was in the perinreum, the scrotal sac being otherwise natural. There was in one a hernia associated with the mal- placed testicle; the bowel clearly descending into the tunica vaginalis down to the testicle. Varicocele. This signifies a varicose condition of the spermatic veins, and when On the disease is well marked their tortuosity and dilatations present the varicocele, appearance (Fig. 385) and impart the feeling of a “ bag of worms ” within the scrotum. It is more common on the left than the right side, the assigned causes of this preponderance being the more dependent position of the left organ and the liability of the vein to be pressed upon by a loaded sigmoid flexure of the colon. It is a disease of young adult life, and is doubtless often, although not always, the product of masturbation, or excess of venery. Anything that retards the return of the venous blood from the organ aggravates, if it does not really cause it. The affection is generally accompanied by a dull aching pain in the part as well as a sensation of weight or ful- ness, but these symptoms are rarely com- plained of at an early period of the affection. The pain often passes up the groin even to the loins, aud is relieved if the patient as- sume the recumbent position, or even by elevating the scrotum. Treatment.—If constipation exists, the bowels must be regulated. Treatment. If the scrotum be pendulous, cold bathing ought to be recommended, and the organ supported by means of a thin suspensory bandage. Tonics are often of use. When this palliative treatment gives relief and retards the progress of the disease, nothing more is needed; but when the disease is severe and these means are ineffectual, a more radical treatment is called for, which consists in the excision, destruction, or division of the veins. Excision is a practice which has been reintroduced since antiseptic Subeuta- surgery has become a fashion, and consists of the removal of about an ne0,ls inch of the diseased vein below the external inguinal ring, after the operation' application of a ligature of carbolised catgut above and below the part to be removed. I have seen good results follow this practice, and have known of had, and regard the operation as far more dangerous than that now to be described. Operation of Ligature.— This is now generally done by a subcutaneous operation. Some surgeons employ metallic wire for the purpose, others silken or hempen ligatures, ligaturing the veins in two places an inch apart. I prefer this operation to every other. Mr. Lee uses two pins to arrest the flow of blood, and performs subcutaneous division of the vessels Causes. Symptoms. Varicocele taken from case of Mr. Jacobson’s.222 AFFECTIONS OF THE SCEOTUM. Morgan’s suspender. Fatty- tumours. Affections of scrotum. between them; and in my hands this operation has been very suc- cessful. Sir B. Brodie used to divide the veins subcutaneously and apply pressure. Mr. J. Wood, of King’s, subcutaneously surrounds the veins with a double wire noose, and keeps up pressure upon the wire by means of a metallic spring till division of the veins occurs. Lee’s opera- tion is performed as follows:—Under chloroform or not, the scrotum on the side of the varicocele is to be taken between the fingers and thumb and the vas deferens (which may always be known by its cordy hardness) allowed to escape, so soon as this is done, a needle may be passed through the scrotum beneath the bundle of spermatic veins, and a figure-of-8 ligature applied over the needle sufficiently tight to arrest the circulation through the veins, but not to cut the skin over them. A second needle is to be applied in like manner, half an inch or more lower down or higher up as the case may be; and the veins divided subcutaneously between the two needles by a teno- tomy knife. Sometimes the veins may be divided two or three days after the insertion of the pins, but there is no object in delay. The ends of the needles are to be cut short after the operation, and on the fifth day may be removed. A day or so later the patient may get up, wearing a suspensory bandage. As a general rule, this operation is most successful, and not dangerous. It is only to be done, however, when palliative treatment fails. Mr. Morgan, of Dublin, has recently suggested an admirable suspender for varicocele and other affections of the testis, which is illustrated in Fig. 386. It consists of a piece of webbing 4j inches long, 3| inches wide at one end, 4 inches at the other, and gradually tapering to the narrower end. A piece of thick lead wire is stitched in the rim of the smaller end, two tapes sewn along the entire length of the webbing, and the sides fur- nished with neat hooks, a lace, and a good tongue of chamois leather. When the suspender has been applied to the testicle, the tapes are to be attached to an abdominal belt. The size may vary more or less. The lead wire encircling the lower end gives a foundation to the general means of support, and keeps the testis within the bag; the patient can mould it more or less to his convenience, and it need not be worn at night. Fatty tumours are occasionally met with in the cord. I have re- moved one the size of a walnut; and fibrous or fibro-cellular tumours have been met with on the testicle. I have seen one of the latter the size of an orange, excised from the testicle with success by Mr. Hilton. Affections of the Scrotum. The scrotal pouch is very frequently the seat of injury, while the Fig. S86.223 TUMOURS OP THE SCROTUM-. testicle, from its mobility, escapes. When the parts are bruised, the Effusion of effusion of blood is at times very great, the blood forming a large blood- diffused scrotal hsematocele, while at others, it forms a distinct tumour. On January 29tl), 1871, I was consulted by T. B—, set. 40, who sat down on the broken arm of a chair, the stump of the arm bruising the perineal border of the scrotum. A swelling at once appeared, and when I saw him, twenty-six hours after the accident, a well-defined blood tumour existed in the median line of the scrotum, the size of a cocoa-nut, the two testicles maintaining their position on either side. By rest, cold lotion, and tonics the blood was absorbed in three months. Lacerated wounds of the scrotum are also attended with blood extra- ^rounij9 vasation, but they usually heal readily on account of the vascularity of the parts. (Edema of the scrotum takes place whenever any inflammation attacks Q5dema 0f the part or the tissues about. It is seen in the inflammation of the epi- scrotum, didymis associated with gonorrhoea and in acute orchitis; in extravasation of urine and urinary perineal abscess; in the retention of urine in child- hood due to the obstruction of a calculus; in phimosis or paraphimosis; in erysipelas. In all these cases it is present, and more or less redness and external signs of inflammation co-exist. Simple oedema is often one of the first indications of renal or cardiac dropsy. Elephantiasis of scrotum.—The scrotum also is not rarely the seat of Elephantiasis elephantiasis arabum—solid oedema of the scrotum, and the disease of scrotum, generally attacks the penis as well. In tropical countries where this affection is common, the tumours attain an enormous size. It is the same disease as attacks the female genitals and other parts of the body and extremities; and in the West Indies is known as the “ Barbadoes leg.” By Mr. Dalton, of Guiana, and other observers it is regarded as a constitutional disease. It is occa- sionally associated with icthy- osis of the tongue, and is often attended with fever and local ery- thema associated with oedema, which never subsides. When attacking the scrotum nothing but its excision is of any use. The historical case in which Mr. Key removed from a Chinaman, set. 32, a tumour, weigh- ing fifty-six pounds (Prep. 1620f>9, Guy’s Museum), of ten years’ growth (Pig. 387), is a good case in point, but the growths attain a larger size than this. Mr. Wiblin, in 1862, ex- cised a growth equally large, and in the ‘Med.-Chir. Trans.’ for 1863, this case with reference to others will be found. Such growths are made up of the elements of ordinary connective tissue. Sir J. Fayrer has operated on many cases. He "rites: The operation for removal of a scrotal tumour is simple Favrer’s enough, but it requires determination and expedition. It needs also mode of the aid of intelligent assistants. Before commencing it is well to have °Pera,ion- Fig. 887. Examples. Elephantiasis of the scrotum. (Key’s case.)CANCER OF THE SCROTUM. 224 the tumour raised and supported in a vertical position for half an hour, to drain it of blood as much as possible; then, the patient having been placed in a recumbent position on an ordinary table, with the nates brought near the end of it, he is to be put under the influence of chloroform, and the incisions are to be commenced. Several assistants are required to hold back the legs, raise the penis and testes, support the tumour, and rapidly secure the bleeding points. These being pro- vided, the operation may be begun. The director is to be introduced into the passage at the bottom of which lies the glans penis, and that organ exposed by laying open with either the long catlin or sharp- pointed bistoury the dense tissue covering it. If the prepuce is healthy, it is well to reflect a portion of it as a future covering to the penis. If the prepuce is involved, or even suspected of being in- volved, it should be carefully dissected away like the rest of the thickened tissue. Having exposed the penis, it is to be raised and carefully dissected out, with or without the prepuce, as the case may be. This is to be raised and held aside by an assistant, care being taken in clearing it out of the morbid tissue not to divide the sus- pensory ligament. Second step « xhe next step is to make a deep and bold incision down to the o opu.i iun. £unica vaginalis on one side. In a large tumour several incisions will be needed before the tunica vaginalis is exposed, which probably will be found much thickened and distended with fluid, forming large hydroceles. These should be laid open, and if the tunica vaginalis be much thickened it should be removed; if not so affected, and the testicle not enlarged, it need not be interfered with. The testicle is then to be dissected out, reflected and held upwards with the penis. A similar proceeding is to be carried out on the opposite side. The tumour is then to be removed by connecting transversely the three vertical incisions already made, and then, either with the scalpel or amputating knife, the remaining portion of the neck of the tumour is to be cut through. It is well before separating it to mark out on the perineal aspect by an incision the line at which the removal is to be completed. During the operation, vessels are to be commanded by the fingers of assistants, and large veins controlled by forceps. It is well that even the most minute bleeding point should be ligatured (or twisted), otherwise when reaction occurs there may be haemorrhage. The bleeding having been controlled, the testes with their elongated cords are to be applied to the surface of the wound; the penis is to be enveloped in a fold of oiled lint, and thus kept apart from the testes, which are also covered and supported in position by oiled cloths.” The largest tumour of this kind on record weighed 200 lbs.

When the growth can be Lee’s isolated by pins passed through its base, the platinum wire ecraseur bribed heated by the galvauic battery is probably the best instrument to use, otherwise the knife is to be employed. When the whole scrotum is removed and the testes are left exposed, hanging from their external rings, the surgeon need be under no alarm, for the parts will granulate up in the course of time, and, what is more, the testicles may become moveable. I have seen this take place more than once. The earlier the disease is removed the better, for by delay the glands of the groin may become involved. The scrotum is occasionally though rarely the seat of tumours, other sebaceous, fatty or fibrous. It is, likewise, the seat of varicose veins; diseases of the small venous radicles appearing as beaded dilatations of a peculiar scrotum, aspect; the disease is, however, of little importance. Tumours or swellings that encroach upon the scrotum from the peri- naeum are probably inflammatory, and are most frequently urinary abscesses associated with and dependent upon some stricture; hut occa- sionally an anal abscess may press forward, and I have seen one occu- pying the whole perinaaum up to the scrotum. These are to be treated by free incisions. STERILITY.—MALE IMPOTENCE AND SPERMATORRHEA. The influence of the sexual functions is so great in the economy of On human life, that any impairment of the organs concerned is a matter *mPotency. of importance, not only in its effects on the bodily health, but even more on the mental state of the person affected. The sexual act is a compound one, physical and mental. The physical organs may be perfect and capable in their way, but if the mental are deficient in energy or weakened by doubt of competency, or under the influence of some emotion such as shame or fear, the act will be spoilt, and failure to complete it must ensue. It is, therefore, clear that impotence, real or imaginary, may be due Causes, to many physical and mental causes. Taylor defines impotency “to be an incapacity for sexual inter- course.” This incapacity may ensue from physical causes, remediable or irremediable. The latter includes loss of penis and testicles, de- Irremediable, formity of penis, including excess of and arrest of development, mal- developmeut, in such cases as ectopia vesicoe, &c. The remediable Remediable causes may be some local affection of the penis or testes. causes. Any condition that prevents the introduction of the organ into the female passage is enough to cause impotence, whether such condition be connected with the penis or testes. The same effect is produced by any disease or congenital malposition or development of the testes, attended with loss of sexual desire, as by old age. A man may, there- fore, be impotent and virile, or impotent and sterile. A man may be capable of sexual intercourse and yet be sterile; ste- rility in the male depending much upon the secretion of the testes, as well as upon the formation of the penis, for semen without sper- matozoa is destitute of procreative power. A man may have a penis the subject of epispadias or hypospadias; he may have sexual desire. Conditions i„ and even power, but if the urethral orifice be so low down as to forbid hypospadias, the semen being conveyed into the vagina, he will be sterile; though all patients with hypospadias are not so. I have known two men who VOL. ii. 15226 SPERMATORRHOEA. Cry pi chide sor- es. misplaced testes. Sterility following disease of testes. Varied sources of sterility. had hypospadias—the orifice of the urethra in each, opening one inch behind the normal urethral opening—to be the fathers of three and four children respectively; and a third, in whom the urethral orifice was one inch behind the glans, whose wife died in childbirth. When the urethral orifice is at the base of the penis, sterility must, however, exist. When partial epispadias exists, there is no reason to believe that a man must be sterile. When both testes are misplaced—that is, when they have not de- scended into the scrotum—there is a strong probability that the organs Conditions in are badly developed, that they do not secrete healthy spermatic fluid, and that sterility co-exists. Curling asserts this very positively to be the fact, but he at the same time brings forward evidence from Messrs. Cock’s and Poland’s practice that such is not always the case. In a general way Mr. Curling may be right, but there are many exceptions Monorchides. to such a rule. When one testis is in the scrotum and healthy, there is no reason to suspect sterility. Sterility sometimes follows disease of the testes, inflammatory or otherwise; for epididymitis or inflammation of the duct of the testicle, as well as testitis or inflammation of the gland may be followed by atrophy of the organ. Gosselin, Godart, and Liegeois have laid great stress upon this; and Curling ascribes these as common causes of sterility. Sterility may also be produced by involuntary seminal emis- sions the result of excess of venery or masturbation, by producing either loss of sexual power or deterioration of semen. Stricture, or any impediment to the seminal discharge, is also another cause. The student must remember, too, that a man may be capable of sexual intercourse and be sterile from other causes. He may even have emissions in connection without seminal secretion, for the emissions may consist only of secretion from the seminal vesicles. I have known this fact illustrated in a man who had lost both his testicles from a surgical operation, and yet had sexual power as strong as ever, attended with emission. The removal of one testicle seems to interfere but little if at all with sexual power. Some years ago, I removed a testicle for cystic disease from a gentleman who had been married many years and had no child. After the operation his wife soon conceived and gave birth to a boy. In the female subject, impotency may be said to exist when the vagina is absent or obliterated. It is for a time present when the orifice is occluded by some dense membrane, or when the introduction of the male organ is prevented on account of the smallness of the orifice, by vaginismus, or the presence of a bifid vagina. Sterility is due to many causes, the occlusion of the os uteri being one, but morbid conditions of the uterus and ovaries are probably the more frequent. Testes do not The student should remember, that “the functions of the testicle, wnste from like those of the mammary gland and uterus, may be suspended for want of use. a ior)g period, possibly for life; and yet its structure may be sound and capable of being roused into activity” on any healthy stimulus. Unlike other glands, it does not waste or atrophy for want of use, the physical parts of man’s nature being accurately adapted to the necessi- ties of his position, and to his moral being. Spermatorrhoea. ton-lioe™6" This doubtless exists as a disease although rare. It consists in Impotence in the female.227 SPERMATORRHOEA. the discharge of spermatic fluid containing spermatozoa with the urine, without sexual desire or sexual excitement. It is commonly associated Attendant with some derangement of the digestive organs, constipation, and symptoms, rectal irritation, spasmodic action of the levator aui acting on the vesiculm seminales and prostate gland. In its most complete form it is associated with an absolute loss of sensation about the veru mon- tanum on the passage of a sound, a patient thus affected allowing the introduction of an instrument without flinching; while the worst cases Causes, are associated with wasting of the testicles and varicocele. It is at times without doubt due to excess of venery, hut more commonly to Effects, masturbation. It commences almost always with nocturnal emissions which gradually become more frequent. These are at first attended with erotic sensation, although not so subsequently, and at last occur without erection. If copulation be attempted, the ejaculation takes place at once, often before the introduction of the organ. It ends in the total loss of sexual inclination and power. Lallemand says that “ seminal emissions supervening during micturition are the most serious.” He holds that “spermatorrhoea is nearly always dependent upon Lallemaml’s irritation of the prostate gland and its ejaculatory ducts, and believes Vlews- that in most cases this irritation, which also exists in the neck of the bladder, is the result of chronic inflammation of the urethra in the prostatic portion of the veru montanum. An old attack of urethritis is the most frequent cause of the seminal emissions, and these emissions are often related to stricture of the urethra.” Trousseau, however, while admitting the force of these observations. Trousseau’s believes that spermatorrhoea or incontinence of semen is due to some Vle"'s- imperfection in the nervous system of organic life, since it is so com- monly found in men who have had incontinence of urine in childhood. He looks upon the masturbation as an indirect proof that there is a had state of the nervous system, and the subsequent impotence, in- sanity, or paralysis as an aggravation of a nervous condition, of which masturbation was only the first morbid manifestation. (Trousseau, ‘ Clin. Med.,’ vol. iii.) This latter view is supported by the fact that in some cases of injury to or disease of the spinal column, sperma- torrhoea is a common associate. False spermatorrhoea is, however, a more common complaint. It False spernm- is supposed to be present when nocturnal emissions are frequent, when lorrb®a. diurnal emissions take place on any sexual thought, and urethral dis- charge of a glairy fluid attends defamation, when erections with dis- charge follow the slightest irritation, such as that produced by riding or walking from the friction of trousers, &c. Such cases are far from rare; and are commonly due to masturbation, but are not cases of true spermatorrhoea, although they often precede it. Nocturnal emissions may be too frequent, hut, if associated with sexual feeling, they are natural. They should, however, be checked, as they lead on to the true disease. The glairy fluid pressed out in defecation is rarely seminal; but is prostatic, of a transparent, tenacious charac- ter, and not milky. The whole genital tract in this affection is in a state of morbid sensibility, of hyperesthesia, and requires treatment, since the false spermatorrhoea is often only the prelude to the true. Treatment.—Trousseau regarding masturbation as a manifestation Treatment of some disease of the nervous centres, speaks strongly in favour of belladonna, and, so far as my experience has gone, I am disposed to Belladonna.SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF FEMALE GENITALS. 22S Tunica.

Imaginary ! impotence. think it a valuable drug given in half-grain doses of the extract twice a day with some tonic, such as iron, zinc, strychnine, or quinine. It seems to act most beneficially, and to check the disposition to mas- turbate in a marked manner. Of course, this good can only be met with when there is in the patient’s mind a strong wish to overcome a repugnant habit. To aid this, the application of a ring of blistering fluid around the penis, or painting the prepuce with iodine, is a valuable adjunct. The bowels, more particularly the rectum, under all circum- stances should be kept empty, and the nightly injection of cold water into the bowel is a useful custom. The patient should sleep upon a hard bed, and he lightly covered. He should not rest on his back, and a solid substance fastened in a handkerchief over the sacrum is a good mode of securing this end. When evidence exists that the mucous membrane of the prostatic urethra is affected near the orifices of the spermatic ducts, Lallemand’s advice of applying a solution of nitrate of siver (gr. v to gr. x to the ounce) every other day should be followed. Some surgeons use a stronger solution, and when an absolute loss of sensibility of these parts is present, galvanism has been highly spoken of. For the appli- cation of the solution, Erichsen’s syringe catheter is the best. Every means should be employed to divert the patient’s mind from the seat of his affection by encouraging mental as well as physical labour. Simple nutritious food should be allowed and cold bathing adopted. In the cases of imaginary impotence of young married men, all that the surgeon has to do is to give confidence, for the failure is probably in the miud rather than in the body of his patient. The best advice is, to recommend abstention from coitus, when Nature in her own time will have her way and assert her power. CHAPTER XXV. SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF FEMALE GENITALS. Wounds of female genitals. Laceration of vagina. Foreign bodies in vagina. Wounds of the external genitals are met with in practice, as the result of violence intentionally committed, or happening accidentally from fall- ing or sitting on pointed or cutting bodies. They are always serious on account of the bleeding that attends them, and wounds of the vagina are particularly so. However severe they are, they should be carefully cleansed, adjusted, and stitched together, for these tissues are very vascular and heal well. Severe lacerations at times take place in the attempt at coitus. Some years ago, I was called to a young married woman for severe haemorrhage from these parts following marital intercourse, the night after marriage, and found two severe lacerations of the orifice of the vagina and the hymen unruptured; the membrane had been practically driven in. Pressure arrested the bleeding. Wounds of the vagina are apt to be followedbyinconvenient cicatrices. Foreign bodies are also at times introduced into the vagina for criminai or erotic purposes. Mr. Hilton removed at Guy’s a flat bone- netting mesh, ten inches long, which had passed through the vaginal walls into the pelvis. Bottles and other foreign matters have also been introduced. Sponges are not uncommonly found in the passage, andSTJKGICAL AFFECTIONS OF FEMALE GENITALS. 229 in a case I knew of, such a foreign body gave rise to the suspicions of cancerous disease. Adherent Labia. The lahia during childhood are apt to adhere together from some Adherent local inflammatory action, and so to close the labial orifice as to in- terfere with the act of micturition. The urine in children thus affected, often squirts in a backward or forward direction, and for this, surgical attention is sought. In these cases, the true condition of affairs will at once he recognised on separating the genitals, for the lahia will he found connected together by a membranous adhesion which passes forwards in some cases to the urethral orifice, thereby affecting the urinary stream. This membrane is readily broken down by separating the labia with the fingers or thumbs, or by means of a probe introduced behind it from above. The application of a little cold cream will complete the cure if care he taken to keep the parts clean. Vulvitis. This is a common complaint in children, and is almost always due to Vulvitis, some rectal irritation such as that caused by worms, scybala, &c., in the feeble and badly fed. It is rarely the result of a gonorrhoeal affection, as is too often suspected, and it is well to he aware of this fact, as it is not uncommon for a surgeon to be consulted about a child with vulvitis under the suspicion that the affection is the result of an impure criminal contact, when it is due to some simple non-venereal cause. It should he treated by local cleanliness and mild astringent lotions, Treatment, such as lead, alum, &c.; when worms are suspected, by the administration of a good mercurial or jalap purge, and attention to the digestive organs and general health; a mixture of rhubarb and soda for a few days, and subsequently a tonic generally effects a cure. Noma, or phagedsenic ulceration of the lahia, similar to the cancrum Phagedaum oris after the exanthemata, is met with in cachectic children, and is a of labia, disease of debility. It commences as an inflammatory swelling of the parts similar to erysipelas, passing on to gangrene and ulceration, and is always attended with great prostration. For its treatment such Treatment, tonics as can he borne should be given ; and particularly iron, quinine, or bark. Wine and abundance of good liquid nourishment should he given by the mouth, or, by the rectum when the stomach rejects it, and milk with chlorate of potash is a good drink. Locally, opium lotion with carbolic acid, nitric acid, or nitrate of silver should be used, and when the ulceration spreads, nitric acid in its concentrated form may be applied or the actual or galvanic cautery. Navi, when found involviug these parts, are to be treated like others. Hernia.—In women, the labium may be the seat of an inguinal hernia hernia, or of a varicocele. The former is known by its own symptoms, the' Varicocele, latter by its wormy feel. It may also become the seat of thrombus Thrombus or blood tumour on the receipt of an injury, which is to he made ' ' out by the history of the case, the sudden appearance of the swelling after an injury, its external aspect and fluctuating feel. Such blood swellings are to be treated at first by the local application of cold to arrest the flow of blood, and, subsequently, by lead lotions. If they tend to break up and form an abscess, a free incision into the swelling is the right treatment to adopt.230 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF FEMALE GENITALS. Abscess. Cysts in labium. Treatment. Sebaceous tumours. Hypertrophy of labium. Cancer of labium. F.pitlieliuni 01 clitoris. Galvanic cautery. Galvanic ecraseur. Labial abscesses form at times as a result of a softened thrombus but more frequently from follicular inflammation. They are very pain- ful and ought to be opened early. Occasionally they are the conse- quence of an inflamed cyst. Labial cysts are very common, and are usually met with on the inner side of the labia. They are similar in their nature to the mu- cous cysts found in the mouth or about the tongue, and are formed in the same way by the obstruction of the ducts of the mucous glands of the parts. They appear as chronic painless swellings producing only mechanical inconvenience; but if neglected, they may inflame and suppurate. On manipulation, they feel tense, globular, and semifluc- tuating, and contain a glairy brown or blood-stained fluid, at times with cholesterine. They are to be treated by excision, or the removal of the presenting surface of the cyst by a pair of forceps and scissors, the removal of one wall exposing the other, which contracts. Excision, however, is the safest practice. When an opening into the cyst is made, the cavity should be plugged with lint, or with lint soaked in tincture of iodine—this fluid exciting adhesive action or suppuration in the cyst wall. Mucous cysts, like these, are also found in the vagina. The internal labia may also be the seat of sebaceous tumours, and of a solid oedema or hypertrophy similar to that seen in the male scrotum not unlike elephantiasis, and grow to a large size. Nothing but their removal can be entertained. Some time since I removed with the galvanic ecraseur from a middle-aged woman, both labia which had attained the size of a cocoa-nut without the loss of a drop of blood, alter having isolated the growths by long pins inserted through their bases, and passed the wire round the pins. When this instrument cannot he obtained, the knife must be employed. Such tumours are highly vascular, and the surgeon requires good assistants in their removal. Cancerous tumours, both epithelial and otherwise, of these parts are also met with, and are known by their ordinary features; they should be treated by removal. It seems that cancer is prone to appear in these regions at an earlier period of life than in others. In 1869 I removed a well-marked cancerous tumour from the labium of a woman only thirty-two years of age. Epithelial disease of the clitoris occurs at times, and I have seen several well-marked cases, hut more commonly it attacks the inner labia and orifice of the vagina. In such cases the benefit of the galvanic cautery is well illustrated, for the removal of these growths by exci- sion is very difficult, and always attended with copious bleeding. When the whole growth cannot be isolated, as much as possible should be ex- cised or scraped off, and the cautery freely applied to the surface and base of what remains. Where the growth can be isolated by the intro- duction of long pins beneath its base and a wire adjusted beneath the pins the galvanic ecraseur, not made too hot and slowly worked, is an admirable instrument to employ. By its means I have success- fully removed on several occasions without the loss of a drop of blood an epithelial cancer occupying the fourchette of the vagina, encroach- ing on the passage and the perinseum. The patients were under chloroform during the operation and felt no pain; the after-pain in these cases being always slight, the cautery entirely destroying the sensibility of the divided parts. Wounds so made heal kindly.SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF FEMALE GENITALS. 231 Lupus also attacks these parts like others; while warty growths are common. Syphilis has received attention in another page. Imperforate hymen is a condition to be recognised and not confused Imperforate with the adherent labia already referred to. The hymen is more deeply “ymen- placed nearer the orifice of the vagina. When imperforate, it causes retention of the menses, the accumulation of the secretions, and a pelvic tumour usually accompanied by periodic pain and constitutional disturbance. The proper treatment of these cases is the division of the imper- Treatment, forate membrane or its complete excision, the object being to allow of the free escape of the retained secretion which is usually black and treacle-like. Success usually attends this practice, though a fatal perito- nitis at times ensues. A rigid hymen is occasionally an impediment to coitus in women who Rigid hymen, marry late in life, and I have known one in which for two years after marriage the husband had never had perfect connection on this account; indeed, it was not till after his wife had become pregnant and the vaginal membrane had been ruptured during the birth of the child, that a satisfactory coitus was effected. I have also been called upon on one occasion, to divide the hymen of a May require lady about thirty, who had been married for some months, and had never ^lv 'slon- had complete connection, the husband’s penis having been very large. There are cases on record, showing that when a vagina is occluded and the patient been married, the urethra has been so enlarged as to admit the finger, and in all probability the male organ. A double vagina is another cause of difficult coitus. I was consulted Double in such a case by a patient who had been married for several years, and Vll^llia- never had connection. The woman came to me, as a divorce was Example, under consideration. She complained of extreme pain whenever an attempt at coitus was made, and the husband of inability to penetrate. On making a careful examination, a double vagina and uterus were dis- covered. I advised the division of the septum with the galvanic wire, by perforating the septum near the uterus and gradually dividing it by means of steady traction upon the wire; but, whilst the ques- tion was under the consideration of both parties, the suspicion of preg- nancy occurred, and time proved its truth. A child was born prematurely after a tedious labour, and I heard no more of the difficulties of the case. She became pregnant a second time. Besides these deformities, others may occur, such as occlusion of the vagina or absence of the uterus, or the opening of the rectum into the vagina, &c. &c. The clitoris is occasionally enlarged at birth, appearing as a small Enlarged penis. 1 have seen an example of this, and at the end of the clitoris a clitoris, depression existed corresponding to the male urethra. The child in other respects was natural. This organ, however, may in after life, become the subject of hypertrophy, indeed, of a kind of elephas as of the male penis, and require removal. Clitoridectomy for epithelial cancer has already been alluded to. Clitoridec- This operation has been practised for epilepsy and supposed erotic tomy complaints, but evidence is wanting to justify the step. The opera- co,ltleimied. tion for such purposes appears at present to be unjustifiable.

I removed one the size of a nut from a child three years old, and similar cases are on record. They should always be ligatured and excised. Rupture of the Perinseum. This accident is not rare as a result of a rapid delivery, and to a small extent it is somewhat common in first labours. When limited, it is not of much importance; hut when extensive, the pelvic organs lose their natural support and are liable to fall, giving rise to rectocele or prolapse of the posterior wall of the vagina, or, cys- tocele or prolapse of the anterior wall of the vagina. When the sphincter ani or rectum is implicated, the accident be- comes of grave importance. At times the rupture is central, and, in the case from which Fig. 388 was taken, the child was born through the rupture B. The incident took place in the practice of a medical friend who sent the case to me. Dr. Wilson witnessed a like process in a similar case (‘Ed. Med. Journ.,’ April, 1875). There is no reason to believe that such an accident is in all cases the fault of the accoucheur, although, doubt- Iig. 388. less, it is so with some; yet with a large child and rapid labour, it is often diffi- cult to prevent. I have known it occur in the practice of very good men. Slight ruptures of the perinseum need not be regarded, but when a rupture in- to the body of the perinseum takes place during labour and the accident is re- cognised, the best practice is to put in one or more sutures at once. This prac- tice is so sound that it cannot be too confidently recommended. When the operation is not performed at once but postponed to the future, it must be left till the period of suckling has passed and the general health of the patient been restored, as the opera- tion being a plastic one, requires good power on the part of the patient, and immediate union of the wound is wanted for success. It is very successful when properly performed; indeed, it rarely fails. Operation.—The bowels should be well cleared out by an ape- rient given two days before, and an enema on the day of operation. Chloroform should be given, the patient placed in the position for lithotomy, with the buttocks brought to the edge of the table, and Clover’s crutch applied to keep the knees apart. An assistant should then well separate the labia, and the surgeon with his scalpel map out the portion of integument that he proposes to remove, remembering that it is well to have a broad surface to bring together as well as a cleanly cut one, for a thin membranous union is useless, and a jagged suiface Central rupture of the perinteum through which child was born.OPERATION FOR RUPTURED PERIN2EUH. 233 will not unite. At least an inch of raw surface should be made from the recto-vaginal septum forward, the width of the bared surface dimin- ishing slightly towards the anterior portion of the labia. Having thus mapped the parts out for removal, the best plan is to perforate the tissues towards their centre and then cut outwards, the right half being first treated and then the left (Pig. 389). Not a remnant of the mucous membrane should be left. If bleeding follows, the larger arteries may be twisted while a little pressure soon controls the smaller. The second step of the operation, or the introduction of the sutures. Introduction remains to be performed, and it is of no less importance than the first. The sutures should he introduced when the quill is used, at least an iuch from the margin of the wound, and when gut alone is employed, a quarter of an inch, the one nearest the rectum being first inserted. When the recto-vaginal septum is involved, the introduction of this suture is of primary importance. It should be passed deeply through the left side of the wound rather behind the level of the septum, through the tissues and the septum, and out at a corresponding point on the right side, being completely buried in its whole course, the object being to draw the septum well forward (Vide Fig. 389.)

The urine should be drawn off every six hours for the first three or four days, and the parts kept clean. Iced milk and beef tea should be given for the first day, but meat and wine subsequently if the appetite allow. The patient may lie on one side when preferred. If the quill suture is used, the deep sutures should be removed on the third or fourth day, and the superficial on the seventh. When silk, wire, or gut sutures have been employed, they may be left for six or seven days; but after the fourth day they should be taken away when suppuration appears in their track. On withdrawing the quill sutures, great care should be observed not to separate the thighs or parts; indeed, for quite ten days or more after the operation this point should be observed. After the first week, the use of the catheter may be dispensed with, the patient making water on her hands and knees, the parts subsequently being carefully sponged. When any offensive vaginal discharge appears, the passage may be syringed with a lotion of Condy’s fluid. The bowels should be locked up for at least a week by small doses of opium twice a day, and then relieved by a dose of castor oil after some warm oil has been injected into the bowel; but, in some cases where union is thought to be feeble, it is well to keep them from acting for a longer period, care being always observed that no large indurated motion be allowed to pass, warm water and oily enemata being used. With this attention, good success generally follows, and women may have subsequent labours without any giving way of the parts. Where much prolapse of the posterior wall of the vagina co-exists, a strip of mucous membrane running up the vagina from the anal end of the recto-vaginal septum may be cut off, and the edges of the wound brought together. I have done this in many cases with au excellent result; indeed, in many cases of prolapse of the uterus, following some slight rupture of the perinaeum or even without, this operation is of great value. In vaginal cystocele, a like operation is of benefit, the removal of a piece of vaginal mucous membrane at its labial border being often fol- lowed by a good result. I am tempted to think that many more of these cases of vaginal and uterine prolapse can be greatly benefited by surgical treatment than the majority of practitioners believe; and that in the future, surgical treatment will be more frequently demanded for these affections. Vesico- and Recto-vaginal Fistulse. Abnormal communications between the bladder or rectum and the vagina, are usually the result of long and tedious labour from slough- iug of the tissues after too much pressure, although at times they may be caused by the rough use of instruments, the retention of a pessary, or the presence of a stone. They are, usually, discovered a few days after the delivery, by urine, -wind, or faeces passing through the vaginal passage, these symptoms appearing on the separation of the slough. The surgeon is usually called upon to treat the case when the puer- peral month has passed and the patient’s powers been restored; till then it would be rash to think of interference. The operation for the cure of these affections is a very good one,235 VAGINAL FISTULA. and generally successful, failure following only in exceptional instances, that is, when the subjects are feeble, with small reparative power, or when the loss of tissues is too great to be made up. Recto-vaginal fistulae are more readily cured than vesico-vaginal, but both operations are alike in principle. Operation.—Without going into its history, full details of which can Operation for be found in the special works on the surgical diseases of women, it may ^^va='"ul be said, that it is to Sims and Bozeman, in America, and to Simpson and Brown, in this country, that the modern operation has been brought to its present state of perfection, although it is probably due to the introduction of chloroform that its great success is to be attri- buted. Very small fistulae may probably be cured by the actual or galvanic cautery, but every opening above the size of a crow-quill demands some plastic operation. In the operation, the surgeon has three main points to observe:— Objects in 1st. To bring the fistula well into view and under control; 2nd, to view, pare with nicety and accuracy its whole margin; and 3rd, to bring into and maintain in apposition, the raw and incised surfaces. For the first object the duck-bill speculum is undoubtedly the best; i. Speculum, by some authors it is spoken of as Bozeman’s, by others as Sims’. It is both a dilator of the vagina and a retractor. Some surgeons, Jobert being amongst them, talk of exposing the fistula by dragging the uterus externally, and thus everting the vagina. I have never had the boldness to use sufficient force to do this, and cannot advise it. Such a measure would, however, greatly facilitate the different steps of the operation. Weiss has recently so arranged the duck-bill speculum as to be self- supporting (Fig. 391). I have used the instrument and have been much struck with its value. For recto-vaginal fistula the patient should be placed on her hack, as Operation for in lithotomy, and for vesico-vaginal fistula this position is at times the recto-vaginal most convenient; though I usually prefer the semi-prone position, the fistula’ Fig. 390.

After- treatment. knees and thighs falling over the end of the table, the surgeon looking down upon the fistula (Fig. 890). When the uterus is dragged down sufficiently far to evert the fistula, the lithotomy position is doubtless to be preferred. The fistula having been brought well into view, the next step is to pare its edges, and in doing this the operator must not be too sparing of tissue; his aim being to obtain as broad and as clean a surface as he can. When this can he secured by means of a knife and forceps, no better instruments are required, the best knife being one that can be adjusted to any angle with rapidity and ease. When the fistula is high up in the vagina or large, the pronged guide (a modification of Hilliard’s, of Glasgow) made for me many years ago is an excellent instrument (Fig. 392). It is readily applied and ensures a clean cut surface. Some surgeons prefer the scissors (Fig. 392a). When this step of the operation has been completed, the edges of the fistula must he brought together, and for this purpose numerous devices have been employed. Splints of all kinds have been suggested, but with experience they have all been discarded, simple wire, silkworm-gut, or silk sutures, fastened with shot or otherwise, being preferred. I have tried every form of splint, and have at last come to gut sutures with or without shot fastenings, using occasionally a plaited fishing silk. The sutures should be introduced tolerably close together, and at a good distance from the margin of the wound, say a third of an inch, and should not be drawn too tight. They should be fastened by running a per- forated shot down over them, taking the precau- tion subsequently, to tie the gut over the shot to prevent its giving way. In this step, the operation is similar to that for fissured palate. In Fig. 393 the needles employed with the mode of introducing and securing the sutures may he seen. A good strong pair of forceps is required to nip the shot after they have been slipped into position. When wire or gut is employed, Startin’s hollow needles may be used, but the ordinary curved needles with good eyes at their ends are the best for silk. With wire, gut, or silk the shot fastenings are the best. After the operation, the vagina should he well cleansed of blood and the bladder emptied. Ice or iced water will generally arrest any bleeding that may ensue. An opiate suppository should be admiuis- Fig. 392. Paring edges of vaginal fistula.237 VAGINAL FISTULA. tered after the operation to give ease, and the same practice should be followed with respect to the bladder and diet as has been recommended after the operation for ruptured perinseum. To leave a catheter in the bladder after the operation for vesico-vaginal fistula often adds to the irritation ; its careful introduction at stated periods being preferable. When from circum- stances this cannot be attended to, the intro- duction of a short catheter, with an open end to allow of the urine passing as it is secreted, should be employed. Dr. Meadows allows his patients to pass their urine in the natural way after the operation, and I have dispensed with the catheter in some cases without any had result. On the sixth or seventh day, the sutures may he removed; but if good union has not taken place and they are not causing irritation, they may be left in position for a longer period. During the convalescence, the vagina should be kept well cleansed by water, or a lotion containing Condy’s fluid. In recto-vaginal fistula, the bowels should be kept locked up for ten days or a fortnight till the wound has firmly united, and then the fasces should be rendered soft by euemata of oil and gruel. When the tissues around the edges of the fistula are too thin to allow of their being pared and, indeed, under some other circumstances, they may he split; that is, the vaginal mucous membrane may be raised from its submucous bed for half or three quarters of an inch round the fistula, and the under surfaces of the raised membrane brought together and held there by a quill suture. I have adopted this method on many occasions, and been most favourably impressed with its advantages. I was led to do so some years ago in a case of vesico-vaginal fistula where there was no tissue to spare, and was pleased subsequently to see so good a surgeon as the late Mr. Collis, of Dublin, make the same suggestion. When this plan is adopted, the sutures must he re- moved on the fourth day, otherwise the pressure of the bougie may cause ulceration. At times it is best only to cut the sutures, and.leave the quills in position for a day or so longer—the amount of irritation they cause being the surgeon’s guide. Dr. Kidd and Mr. Mapother, of Dublin, have adopted however what appears to be a better practice. They Fig. 393. Use of catheter.

When fistula make a U-sliapcd cut round the fistula through the mucous membrane of the vagina, raise the flap thus formed and cut off its lower half, including the opening of the fistula in the vaginal mucous membrane. They then draw down the shortened flap over the fistulous opening into the bladder, and unite it by sutures to the cres- centic border of the mucous membrane forming the bed from which the flap had been raised. The fistulous opening into the bladder is thus covered over with a flap of sound mucous membrane. (‘Brit. Med. Journ.,’ June, 1872.) When the neck of the uterus is involved in the fistula, it may be necessary to lay it open; but when the uterus is involved, it is more frequently necessary to turn the neck of the uterus into the bladder and close the vagina high up. In very extensive lacerations of the vesico-vaginal septum, the surgeon may be called upon to close the vagina nearer its orifice. I have done so on several occasions with good success, two or more operations being required. When the fistula is surrounded by cicatricial tissue, and when after b Scic™tndaf ^'e adaptation of its edges there is much tension, lateral incisions through the parts are of great use; as they allow the edges to come together more readily, and thus facilitate repair. In recto-vaginal fistula unconnected with parturition, before an of the disease operation is attempted, the surgeon should satisfy himself by a digital rectum. examination of the rectum that no stricture or disease of the rectum co-exists to which the fistula is secondary. Vascular excrescences are very common in the female urethra, and from their great sensibility cause severe pain. They at times pro- ject from the meatus as a florid outgrowth, are often attended with a discharge of mucus, and at times of blood, also with irritability of the bladder. Their removal is the only sound treatment, which can be effected by forceps and scissors, or by means of the galvanic cautery. When the former practice is followed, the growth should be well drawn downwards and excised, a stick of nitrate of silver being applied to the base of the tumour to prevent bleeding. When any doubt exists as to its complete removal, chloride of zinc may be used. When the urethra is the seat of more than one such growth, the introduction of a stick of sulphate of zinc at intervals of two or three days,may be followed by the withering of the growths; but when this result does not ensue, the passage must be dilated and the growths re- moved. Nitric acid in some cases is a good caustic to ensure their destruction when excision or the galvanic cautery cannot be employed, and Dr. A. Edis has recently (‘ Brit. Med. Journ./ April 4th, 1874), used with advantage the saturated solution of chromic acid, applied by means of cotton wool rolled round a stick to the growth until the sur- face became shrivelled. To facilitate the use of any of these means, but more particularly the destruction of the growth with the galvanic cautery, I have found the use of the boxwood or ivory speculum and dilator depicted in Fig. 394 Fig. 394. tissue.

The urethra can he readily, dilated by it, the growth made to project through the aperture left in its side, and the whole destroyed without doing any injury to the healthy tissues. Polypi of the female bladder may protrude through the urethra, and Polypi of put on the appearances of a urethral growth; but a complete examina- tion of the urinary organs will prevent the surgeon falling into any error of treatment. Fibro-cellular tumours at times grow in the urethra and cause much local Fibro- distress.

Irritable-Bladder in women is a very common effect of uterine dis- irritable turbance or displacement, as well as of rectal disease. Such a symptom bladder, demands the closest investigation to ascertain its cause. It is mostly secondary to disease of the uterus, &c., and not often dependent on bladder affections. CHAPTER XXVI. DISEASES AND TUMOURS OF THE BREAST. Sore Nipples are sources of great distress and too often the pre- Sore nipples, cursors of mammary abscess. They are doubtless often caused by some aphthous condition of the child’s mouth, but as frequently result from some unusual sensibility of the skin of the part, and at times from want of care. In first pregnancies mothers should always harden Prevention, their nipples by the daily use of some spirit lotion, or eau de Co- logne and water; and, where they are not sufficiently prominent, a breast glass or gutta-percha shield, such as that sold by Elam, of Oxford Street, should be worn, as nothing tends more than these means to prevent this troublesome affection. When sore nipples occur at the time of suckling, the same shields Treatment, should be worn, great care being observed to dry the nipples after use, and never to leave them in the child’s mouth after the process has been completed. The application of the glycerine of tannic acid, Applications. Richardson’s styptic colloid, tincture of catechu, a solution of nitrate of silver, gr. v to the ounce of water, or an ointment of extract of rhatany, gr. viiij to 5ij of the oil of theobroma, are good applications. Castor oil as an external application, or collodion, is sometimes useful. When cracks exist, it is a good plan for the mother to draw out the Mode of nipple by means of the old-fashioned feeding bottle before giving it drawing out to the infant, the mother’s nipple being put into the central opening, tlle niPPle- and her mouth drawing the artificial one. Another ready method is the application to the nipple of the mouth of a wide-necked empty bottle that has been heated by hot water, the nipple, as the bottle cools, being pressed into the bottle and rendered prominent in a painless way. Engorgement of the breast takes place, when, from any cause, a Engorgement woman is unable to give suck, either from defect or disease of "the nipple of tlle breast, or the death of the child. Under these circumstances, the gland may become tense and distended, and, if left unrelieved for twenty-four or thirty-six hours will probably inflame. When the gland, however, can be relieved by the application of an infant to [the nipple, or next best by a bottle in which a partial vacuum has been made by means of hot water, the mother’s mouth, or a very carefully applied breast pump, » the engorgement may subside and no harm accrue.240 INFLAMMATION OF THE BREAST.

Pressure should then be employed by means of strapping, which must be applied over the gland previously smeared with the extract of belladonna, rendered liquid with an equal part of glycerine. A sa- line or other purge is often of value, with some tonic medicine as quinine—a mixture of two or three drachms of the sulphate of mag- nesia and one or two grains of quinine, two or three times a day being as good as any. In lobular engorgement of the breast, gentle friction is of great value, with or without oil, and warm and moist applications are also most useful. INFLAMMATION OF THE BREAST. This may appear as a subcutaneous more or less extensive peri-glan- dular abscess; a local phlegmonous lobular inflammation; or a diffused abscess throughout the whole gland; and may primarily involve the connective tissue which exists between the lobules as well as the true secreting structure of the gland. It may likewise occur behind the gland. It may be acute or chronic in its nature; it may run its course with- out any breaking up of tissue or suppuration, or be attended with most destructive local results; the extent of destruction of tissue depending upon the severity of the inflammatory process, and the amount of constitutional power of the subject of the disease. As a rule, however, suppuration takes place. “When the mamma, in its state of full expansion and perfect func- tional activity, becomes the subject of an interference, the result is very commonly a diffuse or nodular inflammation and the formation of an abscess. A sudden stoppage of the milk soon after the lactation has been established is apt to produce inflammation, and the same result, or a degree of it, sometimes follows the weaning of the child after a long course of suckling. The disturbing cause, whatever it may be, acts upon the mamma when its function is at its greatest intensity, and the characteristic effect is inflammation and abscess.”—Creighton. In a general way, inflammation attacks the breast gland when in a state of activity ; and it is exceptional for the passive organ to be the subject of this process; for out of 102 consecutive cases under my observation, 79 occurred during lactation, 2 during pregnancy, and 21 in patients who were neither suckling nor pregnant. Moreover, three fourths of the cases that occurred during lactation attack patients during the first two months. In many of these, a cracked nipple was the assigned cause, but I am disposed to think with Mr. Ballard, that abscess in the early months is due to the searching of the child after milk before the gland is filled, in patients who have neither sufficient power to secrete milk, nor to resist the inflammatory process when once originated. The affection is more common in primiparse, and the right breast is more frequently affected than the left in the propor- tion of 5 to 3. In some cases, the rapidity of the process is very marked, an abscess forming within a few days, while in others it is most insidi- ous ; chronic abscesses have been often mistaken for new growths, and amputation of the gland performed under this false diagnosis. Abscesses occur in infants' breasts, and they are too commonly the con- sequence of an ignorant nurse applying pressure to the glands in which milk is found, or friction to “ rub away the milk.” The milk appears to be more abundant in the male than in the female infant. They are also met with in the male subject from injury or other causesABSCESS OP THE BREAST. 241 Chronic mammitis in the boy or girl, is by no means a rare affection, Chronic the undeveloped gland becoming indurated and very painful; yet such ^e“oung‘“ cases rarely suppurate. Treatment.—The activity of the treatment of the affection we are Treatment of now considering must be regulated by the acuteness or severity of the ^a®“£taon inflammatory process, and the nature of the constitutional and local symptoms to which it may give rise. As a broad truth, it may be confidently asserted, that the inflammatory process is of a low type and of a destructive nature, and, that as the constitutional powers are generally feeble, nothing like lowering measures should be adopted, but, on the contrary, soothing local appli- cations and constitutional tonics with sedatives are absolutely demanded. In cases occurring during lactation no other principle of treatment During than those I have just laid down should be entertained. Under such lactallon- conditions, soothing fomentations to the breast, either of warm water or some medicated solution, such as the decoction of poppies, give most relief, although a light linseed poultice or some spongiopiline may be well employed. In young, robust women, where suckling is impossible, the application of laxatives and powerful purgatives may be called for. Eest in the horizontal position affords striking comfort, and. Rest, when it can be carried out, is of great practical advantage; but, if this desideratum caunot be secured, the whole breast must be supported by a band or linen sling. During this time, tonics in such a form as Tonics, can be borne and may be indicated should freely be given, quinine probably being the best. Such stimulants as wine or beer must be cautiously administered, though the cases are few which do not require such an addition to their diet, while plenty of nutritious food should be allowed. A sedative at night is also very generally re- Sedatives quired, and Dover’s powder in ten-grain doses is the best form, for want of sleep from pain is a common accompaniment. A mild purgative in the early stages of the disease may be necessary, i. but excessive purgation should be avoided, since the object of the 3 surgeon is to supply power, and not to remove it—to soothe and not to irritate. On opening a mammary abscess.—There is a great difference of On the » opinion among surgeons about the propriety of opening a mammary opening of a I abscess. Some think the best practice is to let the breast alone, ”J™™sary » and leave the operation to nature,- while others advocate an early j opening. But in neither am I disposed to coincide, for while I 1 regard it as a right practice to postpone puncturing the organ as i long as possible and not to show any over-anxiety in evacuating the a pus*, on the other hand, I know that when the abscess is left to 9 itself much unnecessary suffering is endured and a considerable i' sacrifice of skin often follows, entailing a long convalescence and an ugly cicatrix. The practice I consequently generally adopt is to leave the parts alone till pointing has taken place and : then to puncture, making my incision in a line radiating from the Incision to I. nipple of the patient. By adopting this practice, any unneces- ™diate from sary pain is saved, for the appearance of pointing is directly under the uiPPle- ‘ the observation of the surgeon, and it is not necessary to . make frequent and careful physical examinations.

Pressure. of gentle manipulation is absolutely called for to enable the surgeon to form an opinion, but the eye, and not the finger, is the chief guide. Much manipulation of the gland is both painful and injurious, and an absolute abandonment of all local surgical treatment can only be condemned. Warm fomentations in all stages of the disease are very grateful to the patient, and may be freely used; and when early suppuration threatens, a light linseed poultice is probably the best application. When the abscess has discharged, the poultice may be laid aside, and wet lint alone employed, as constant poulticing soddens the integument and retards the process of convalesence. On the treatment of chronic abscess of the breast. The existence of a chronic abscess having been made out—a point, by- the-bye, which willbe returned to when the subject of the diagnosis of a mammary tumour is discussed—it becomes an important question what treatment should be pursued. When the abscess is small, causing little or no annoyance, it may be left alone, and, under the influence of tonics and local pressure by means of strapping, the fluid may be absorbed, and such a result is occasionally brought about. In the majority of examples, however, some more active treatment is necessary, and of these the evacuation of the pus is the chief point. If the abscess is large and deeply seated— a common condition—the drawing off of its contents by means of a trocar and canula is the usual practice and is generally believed to Evacuation of p,e pcst. put it has this disadvantage, that the wound generally soon closes, and a second operation is required. The same treatment may be again resorted to with the same results, and this drawing off of the pus and the subsequent closure of the wound may go on for many times. At last, however, the opening remains patent, and the abscess contracts, leaving a sinus in the majority of cases. Under these circum- stances, a bolder plan of treatment seems absolutely demanded, as time is an important element in the consideration of any plan of treat- Eree incision, ment. The best method appears to be a free opening at the first operation, the surgeon subsequently inserting a strip of oiled lint into the cavity of the abscess for a few hours to prevent the wound closing. Submammary Abscess. I' io. 395. Abscesses occasionally form behind the breast gland over the pectoral muscle, and when they do, the gland is pushed forward in a way that is cha- racteristic. The abscess (Pig- 395), as a rule, points below the breast. Such abscesses should be opened iu the most depen- dent position as soon as any indication of fluctuation can be made out. This disease is very slow in its progress. On the treatment of sinuses. The treatment of sinuses the breast, as elsewhere. the pus by trocar.. On submammary abscess.

The one principle of practice which seems to he the most valuable is the establishment of a dependent outlet; and for this pur- pose the introduction of a drainage tube is a simple and successful practice. If there are many sinues, some pressure may he employed by means of strapping, care being taken that the openings are left uncovered to ensure a free passage for the discharge. Superficial sinuses may be slit up, when other means fail, and in very chronic cases some irritant such as iodine, may be injected, to excite a fresh action. The great principle of practice in these cases, however, appears to be that to which I have already alluded, although other means may at times be demanded. Chronic Induration of the Gland. This affection occurs when, from some cause or other, the gland is j^nraSonft f morbidly excited. It is chiefly found in unmarried women between brcosT. °' ° the ages of thirty-eight and forty ; though it occurs in the married, and then, as a rule, in the sterile. It is usually associated with some catamenial irregularity or general disturbance, and more particularly of the nervous system. The affection is known by the excessive sensibility of the indurated Symptoms, gland on manipulation, the nervous excitement the examination causes, the total absence of any local indications of a tumour when the fingers are placed fiat upon the part, and, the induration of the gland or lobe of the gland, when the organ is raised from the pectoral muscle and pinched. The treatment consists in correcting what is wTrong in the general Treatment, condition of the patient by meaus of iron, tonics, and alteratives, and soothing the affected part. Cold lotions are at times grateful, while at others a belladonna plaster affords relief, with or without pressure. Large breasts should be suspended, and all should be protected by cotton wool from the risks of injury. The irritable mamma of young girls is closely allied to the affection On irritable just described; and is associated with a morbidly sensitive condition of mamma, the mammary gland and parts around, and often with some indura- tion. It is an affection closely connected with the pelvic generative organs which are mostly found to be not acting fairly, as indicated by catamenial irregularity, &c. This condition is, doubtless, at times excited by depraved habits. It should be treated on the same principle as the last affection. ON TUMOURS OF THE BREAST. Their Clinical Examination and Diagnosis. Tumours of the breast may rationally be accounted for by following out the functional aberrations of the organ, and in proof of this the student should study carefully the highly suggestive and valuable work of Dr. Charles Creighton,1 who has shown that “ the investiga- Dr. Creigh- tion of breast tumours reveals merely the working of the physio- ton s views* logical law of healthy mammary activity under altered circumstances, that various degrees of disordered function may result in various kinds of tumours,” and that tumour disease of the breast is “ essentially a disorder of function.” 1 ‘ Contributions to the Physiology and Pathology of the Breast,’ 1878.TUMOURS OP THE BREAST. 244 Evolution of [;lanil. Involution gland. Lowest stage of action. Intermediate stage. When stimulus is at its height. When breast is disturbed in disease. The breast, in passing from its “ resting ” or inactive state to that of full activity, undergoes during the entire period of pregnancy, a process of “evolution” which is characterised in its different stages by certain cell changes within its acini and transport of cells without; and, in the return of the gland to its quiescent condition on the sub- sidence of lactation, a process of “ involution ” in which a parallel series of changes acting in an inverse order is to be observed, the functional subsidence of the gland being spread over a shorter period of time than its gradual awakening during pregnancy. When the functional stimulus of the mamma is acting at its loivest point at the beginning of “ evolution ” or the ending of “involution,” the secretory product is a large granular yellow pig- mented cell, which cells are found within the secreting acini, in the con- nective tissue spaces outside the secreting structure, and likewise in the lymph-sinuses of the subjacent lymphatic glands, these cells being the waste products of a feeble degree of secretory activity; and, if the mammary excitation were always to act at that degree of intensity, the secretion it may be said would always be in the form of large granular pigmented cells. At the next appreciable advance in the intensity of the stimulus, the product formed in the gland may be described somewhat generally as a large granular nuclear cell, which is nothing else than the crude epi- thelium of the middle period of the breast’s unfolding, in which an imperfect secretory force resides. Coming s till nearer to the full excitation, the cellular ingredients are fewer and the mucous production much more abundant, and finally, when the stimulus is at its height, the mucous fluid has given place to a fatty fluid, and whatever cellular elements the secretion contains are the well-known colostrum cells which approach most nearly the perfect secreting cell. The periodical unfolding of the breasts, which is an obvious accompaniment of each pregnancy, is thus characterised by a progressive series of immature secretory products which necessarily run to waste. The epithelial cells are not transformed into milk till the time of delivery and during the period of suckling following; but the functional action of the breast has been at work all through the pregnancy, and has advanced in intensity just as the secreting struc- ture has advanced in its unfolding. The various stages of unfolding have corresponding secretory products, becoming less and less crude, and as there is a similar series of more rapid but exactly parallel waste products in the upfolcling, it is a legitimate inference to ascribe “ a special kind of secretory product to a certain degree of intensity of the glandular force.” When the breast gland is disturbed from its resting state by a cause other than pregnancy, and, in consequence of some morbid excitation is urged into a kind of evolution process, the steps of its unfolding are less orderly than in the normal evolution, and the' “ spurious excitation ” never carries the gland to the end of its un- folding or to the perfect degree of its function. And, although the morbid excitation may be said to correspond in its intensity to a stage i j, of the normal evolution, there is this fundamental difference, that the corresponding stage of the normal process is transient, giving place to ) ( a stronger force while the morbid process continues indefinitely at the I same enfeebled level. As a consequence, the cell that should have245 TUMOURS OP THE BREAST. been thrown off from the acinous as waste almost as soon as it was formed, remains in the place of its origin to multiply, and, with its progeny, to infest the glandular structure of the breast either as intra or extra-acinous accumulations. Indeed, according to Dr. Creighton, it is upon deviations from the physiological track such as these that the How tumours existence of a tumour depends. _ form- Thus “ a circumscribed tumour arises at a particular part of the gland where the spurious excitation has advanced to a certain stage of evolution or unfolding; in that particular region, probably a territory defined by the blood vessels, the functional force has acted at a uniform imperfect level for a length of time, the inevitable cel- lular waste of the crude secretion has accumulated within the acini or around them, and the foundation of a tumour has been laid. In the healthy action of the organ there is a provision for the dis- posal of the very considerable amount of cellular waste material by means of the neighbouring lymphatic glands. In passing from the secreting acini and in traversing the stroma of the gland, the waste cells often acquire a spindle form; and although these cells are not always distinguishable from the connective-tissue cells of the part, there is, especially in the bitch, a class of pigmented epithelial cells in which such changes of form and position can be clearly traced. The spindle-shaped waste products are the type of the peri-acinous cell- collections in cystic or adeno-sarcoma. So far as relates to the large nuclear cells, the iwfra-acinous collec- tions of them correspond to the structure of medullary cancer, and the ej?<ra-acinous infiltrations of the same cells are a distinguishing feature of scirrhus. “ The distinguishing feature of the less malig- nant form of tumour is that the spurious functional activity comes nearer in the degree of its intensity to that of the perfect secretory force, the transformation of the epithelium is a more real transfor- mation, and the cellular waste is reduced, in part at least, to the class of fibre-like or crescentic elements that characterise the myxomatous Iand more benign issues of the tumour process.” “ The circumstance that the unknown diseased excitation most com- monly befalls the gland when it is in the state of rest is of the first importance in accounting for the formation of a tumour. Whether the disturbance be a mechanical injury, or a sympathy with excite- ment in the ovaries, or of a more general emotional nature, it comes upon the breast in its resting state. The breast can react in no other !way than by following the somewhat slow process of its normal evo- lution; without the intermediate stages of unfolding it cannot reach the perfect degree of its functions in which there would be immunity from danger. The intermediate stages are necessarily associated with the formation of crude cellular products; it is at one or other of the intermediate stages that the morbid force delays, and the correspond- ing cellular secretion of the gland thereupon assumes the character of a formative or tumour process.” “ The circumstances of the functional disturbance are never exactly the same in any two cases, consequently, the respective modifications of structure or in other words, the structure of the respective tumours are never exactly the same.” When a tumour forms in the breast within the period when the i function may still be awakened to its full and healthy vigour, thatTUMOURS OF THE BREA8T. 246 is, during the period of its structural and functional maturity, a reso- lution of the disease or a dispersion of the diseased products may be looked for. But, when it appears at or near the climacteric years, when the gland is suffering an effacement of its secreting mechanism and a withdrawal of its secretory force, no such a result can be ex- pected, and it is at this period that the greater number of intractable tumours occur. “ It is the climacteric effacement of the breast that gives a peculiar character to the disease in women, and there are well-marked struc- tural differences in the tumours according as they appear before or after that period. Those that develop after the climacteric years are perhaps the most common, as they are certainly the most intrac- table, and they have been the real source of ambiguity in the patho- logy of the organ. That ambiguity depends upon the circumstance that they occur in an organ which is gradually losing or has lost its characteristic structure.” Where the normal itself is vanishing, the departures from the normal are elusive. It seems probable, therefore, from Dr. Creighton’s investigation, that the adenomata, sarcomata, myxomata, and carcinomata have their type in a series of progressive changes which the gland undergoes in its physiological evolution. The feebler the intensity of the function, the more cancerous the disease; the higher or more advanced the evolution from the resting state, the more benign the tumour. Oil the diagnosis of tumour of the breast. Is there a new growth! Mode of manipulating, Birkett’s method. The Clinical Examination and Diagnosis of a Breast Tumour. From a practical point of view, tumours of the breast may be divided into inflammatory, adenoid or innocent, and malignant, for simple hypertrophy or excess of growth of the gland can hardly be classed among the tumours. The first point a surgeon has to determine when consulted by a patient who has “something the matter” with her breast, is practically the existence or non-existence of a tumour, i. e., is there a new growth developed behind, and in connection with the mammary gland ? or, is the disease from which the patient is suffering situated in the sub- stance of the glandular structure itself ? This first and most important question ought to be solved before a further step can with safety be taken; before the formation of a correct diagnosis of the case can be made; and it is quite impossible to magnify its importance. To do this, however, considerable care is necessary, and some manipulative skill must be called into requisition; as a careless examination will surely end in an uncertain diagnosis, and with this, a failure in treatment must necessarily follow. In examining a breast, therefore, with diagnostic intentions, the surgeon with the whole gland well in view, should place the palmar surfaces of his fingers over the suspected spot, and taking the gland in his hand manipulate it gently and in every part with his fingers and thumb ; when, if au isolated tumour can be found, he will in all probability detect its presence; if, however, he is uncertain upon this point, he should make the patient lie down, for “ if a patient be sitting or standing, and the breast is grasped by the finger and thumb, when induration of the gland itself exists, a sensation is felt as if a tumour were present. If, now, the palmar surface of the fingers be pressed flatly against the chest in the same part,DIAGNOSIS OF ADENOCELE OF THE BREAST. 247 nothing remarkable will be distinguishable. If a tumour or new growth exists, however, it is immediately perceptible. But if a doubt arise in the matter, the patient should recline when under examination; and then, if there be a tumour, it is immediately manifest to the touch, and often to the eye.—Birkett. Having then detected the pre- sence of a tumour, that is, an independent growth developed in the neighbourhood of the breast-gland and probably in connection with it, the question arises as to its nature. Is it a simple or a malig- nant tumour ? If the tumour be moveable and hard, if quite free, piaenosis of or has but a very uncertain connection with the gland structure, adenocele. there is a strong probability that the tumour is of a simple nature; and, if it has existed for several months, this probability becomes stronger, for the cancerous tumour has a tendency even when prima- rily developed as a tuber or as an independent structure, to associate itself and becomes connected with the neighbouring tissues; and if this has not taken place, the absence of these conditions enhances the probability of the simple nature of the growth under examination. If the patient is also young and healthy, and no other abnormal con- ditions, either of the breast or neighbouring structures are to be detected, the probability becomes a certainty, and the presence of an “adenocele” may be determined on—this tumour being synonymous with the chronic mammary tumour of Sir. A. Cooper, the mammary glandular tumour of Paget, the sero-cystic sarcoma of Brodie, or the adenoma of Birlcett. These adenoceles are found as a rule in the young and unmar- Symptoms of ried, and in the apparently healthy and robust, although occasionally adenocele. they occur in the aged. They appear during the period when the pro- creative organs, and among them the mammary glands are in a state of “ developmental perfectionand when they occur in married women, are most frequently developed during pregnancy or suckling. They are never associated with any other symptoms than such as can be produced mechanically by their presence, and never involve the integument except by distension; nor is the skin ever infiltrated by any new material. They are never accompanied by any secondary enlargement of the absorbent glands nor associated with any secondary deposits; they cause no cachexia nor undermine the health; but affect the patient solely through local influences, and demand treat- ment chiefly from local considerations. They may be found in either breast, occasionally in both, and are constantly multiple, two or more I tumours being often found in the same gland.

But yet, if careful observations are taken, an error in diagnosis should not be made. For, although the breast itself may be much pressed on or even expan- ded over the tumour, it will still exist, and, on careful examination its presence, as a rule, will be made out. The nipple, although flattened from the extreme glandular ex- pansion, can still be seen (Fig. 397) ; and is rarely retracted. The integu- ments may be stretched to an extreme point, yet will they still be move- able and sound (Fig. 396), although some inflamma- tion from over-distension may have made its ap- pearance, and large veins are always to be observed meandering in the healthy tissue. The tumour, if solid, may appear ta- bulated (Fig. 397), and if containing cysts, fluctuation may be detected. Still, the disease is essentially a local one, and affects the patient through purely local condi- tions. It is to be treated only by ex- cision, and the gland, as a rule, should be left unharmed, the tu- mour being turned out of its capsule. In extreme examples, however, the breast is so stretched out as to be useless, and then must be removed. In the patient from which Fig. 397 was taken, this was the case. She was a woman, set. 35, and the tumour was of six years grow The diagnosis of a tumour which is evidently caused by some paitial or general enlargement or infiltration of the mammary gta^d. Let us suppose that the surgeon has a case of disease of the breast Cystic adenocele. Fig. 397. Solid adenocele of six years’ growth, in A. S—,ffit. 36.249 DIAGNOSIS OF TUMOURS OF THE BREAST. before him in which the structure of the gland is itself involved, and there is no independent moveable tumour, such as we have been con- sidering; but that on manipulation it is evident the growth, what- ever it may be, is intimately connected with the gland structure. What is the case ? Have we an inflammatory affection only of the organ, or some hypertrophy or innocent enlargement ? Is it a simple or a malignant disease ? When the manipular indications of the mammary gland are those only of enlargement, is such a condition due to pregnancy, or the product of a simple hypertrophy, confining the meaning of that term to an excess of growth ? If the increase be due to hypertrophy, which is a somewhat rare Hypertrophy, condition, it has been to a certainty of a chronic nature, and its increase slow and growth painless. The gland will appear simply enlarged, with no increase in action beyond that which growth demands, although this increase in growth may be very great. It is found mostly in young women, but I have seen it in the male; at times, it affects only one gland. In the case from which Fig. 398 was taken, each gland on removal weighed about fourteen pounds. I saw the case some years ago at Grantham with my friend Mr. Shipman. The breasts were subsequently removed by Sir W. Fergusson. That the affection is something more than a mere increase in the {growth of the gland is proved by the fact that, in a woman, rot. 43, who had this disease in her right fl breast of thirteen years’ growth and not in her left, and had a child u no milk was secreted in the diseased gland, while in the sound one there was abundance. If the enlargement due to pregnancy, there can be little difficulty Pregnancy, in the diagnosis, for it is attended with an activity of the local cir- culation, a general fulness of the gland, an enlargement of its veins, and a darkening of the areola, which will not fail to excite suspicion. Besides this, both glands will be similarly affected, a coincidence which is rarely seen in any morbid condition. The very suspicion of preg- nancy, however, will be enough to call attention to other points, by which a solution of the difficulty can be obtained. Is the enlargement to be explained by any inflammatory condition 1 Chronic I do not mean an acute inflammatory condition, for such an affection has inflammation features which are too characteristic to allow any mistake in diagnosis and cancer- being made, but is this infiltration of the gland which is present to be explained by some chronic inflammatory change, such as is so frequently found in the female breast; or is it the early stage of an infiltrating cancer ? The answer to this query is not always easy. In middle-aged patients when cancerous affections may be looked for, Fig. 398. Hypertro- phied breasts do not secrete milk.

On the infiltrating cancer: its characters. the presence of an indurated mammary gland, wholly or in part, must always be regarded with suspicion, and, if the case he recent, I believe it to be an impossibility to form any certain opinion as to its true nature. If the induration of the gland be the only symptom, and is associated with a sharp or even dull pain, either a simple chronic inflammation of the gland may be indicated or the early condition of a cancer, and under such circumstances, it is as well to wait before giving any positive opinion. If, however, much time has already passed, say, many months, and no other symptoms have made their appearance, there is some ground for the hope that the enlarge- ment may be due to inflammation, since infiltrating cancers are not generally inactive—are not stationary, as a rule—and soon give rise to other symptoms, such as some, though it may be, slight enlarge- ment of the absorbent glands; some slight dimpling or drawing in of the skin, an important sign (Fig. 400); or, some more marked symptom such as infiltration of the integument or a retracted nipple. It should be remembered, however, that a retracted nipple is only an accidental symptom such as may be caused by several conditions, and is not by any means of itself characteristic of cancer. But if any or all of these symptoms show themselves soon after the first appearance of the lobu- lar enlargement of the mammary gland, an opinion as to the cancerous nature of the growth may be confidently expressed. If, on the other hand, none of these symptoms make their appearance, aud the indura- tion or infiltration of the lobes of the gland remains stationary, or shows some tendency towards improvement, the probability of the simple character of the disease gains ground. When this indura- tion of the mammary gland appears in a young subject, there will be no reason to suspect a cancer, and it should rather be regarded as the result of some slight inflammatory effusion. Under such cir- cumstances there will, generally, be some increase of pain after examination, but an absence of any other local symptom. There will probably be some irregularity of the catamenia and some signs of general excitability of the patient. But, as a local affection, there will be only the one symptom of induration of one or more lobes of the mammary gland, which, in the absence of all other signs, may with safety be regarded as inflammatory. The same argument holds good when the disease disappears at a later period of life, although suspicions of a cancer should rightly be excited; still, the positive diagnosis must be postponed till, by the lapse of time, some other symptoms such as those already mentioned make their appearance, to clear up all doubt, or by their absence, prove the innocent nature of the affection. Carcinoma of the Breast, or Cancer. This affection is found either as an infiltration of the gland, wholly or iu part, or as an independent tumour or tuber within the meshes of the gland—tuberous cancer. It may likewise be met with associated with cysts—cystic cancer, this being only a variety of the other forms. In the infiltrating form, the gland appears hard, inelastic, and incom- pressible; as the disease progresses, it seems to contract and to draw all the parts around together and gradually to infiltrate them. Iu this way the nipple often becomes drawn in or to one side. At times, after having been drawn in, it becomes infiltrated with the disease, and251 CANCER OF THE BREAST. Fig. 899. nipple.

The skin is at first dimpled, then puck- ered, and at last infil- trated. The breast also, from being a moveable organ, be- comes fixed; so fixed, indeed, that it cannot be separated from the pectoral muscle. This form of cancer is the more common. The disease may ap- pear in one lobe or in all, and be slow in its progress or rapid, but in every case its pro- gress is much alike; generally, however, this infiltrating form of cancer assumes the characters of the tuberous. In Figs. 399,400 these changes are clearly shown. Fig. 400. Tuberous caucer commences as a circumscribed indepen- dent growth within the gland structure, with a well-defined capsule separating but not in- filtrating the tissues. Some- times two or more tubers ap- pear together, and these may at last coalesce. This form, unlike the infiltrating does not contract, but grows in all directions, involving all the parts which it touches, push- ing the breast to one side, or drawing it to itself (Fig. 401). It often attains a large size, giving rise to an irregular lobulated tumour. It is at times soft in consistence, when it is called medullary can- cer ; when firm, it is known Infiltrating cancer with puckered integument, as fibrous; when jelly-like, From model.

As the glands enlarge, nerve pains down the arm appear, and oedema of the arm commences from the mechanical obstruction to the venous circula- tion of the extremity caused by the enlarged glands. At times a serous effusion takes place into the pleural cavity of the affected side sufficient to destroy life. In some rare cases of cancer the disease ap- pears as a brawny in- filtration of the breast and integument over it, some erythematous red- ness and cedema being mixed with it at its onset. These cancers are of the worst kind, and speedily destroy life. In other cases, mostly chronic, the disease is more cutaneous and shows itself as a tuber- cular affection of the skin which gradually spreads, till at last the part affected seems skin- hound. This condition may be limited or ex- tensive ; and occasion- ally involves the whole of one side. I have re- cently had a case under observation in which both breasts, the sternum, sides, and half the dorsal region of the back were thus involved. At times this tubercular development is associated with acute or recurrent disease. In rare examples it occurs as a primary affection and is very chronic, the tubercles even disappearing by atrophy. A cancerous tumour of the breast most frequently appears in middle life, that is, when the procreative organs are verging towards their natural period of functional decline, such a period taking place at an earlier date in the single than in the fruitful woman. It attacks married women more frequently than the unmar- ried, and, when infiltrating or involving the breast-gland, is seldom stationary. As the disease progresses unchecked, ulceration of the integument, preceded by a softening down or breaking-up of the tumour itself will soon appear, and with this, the characteristic infiltration of the margin of the wound will occur and give rise to indurated, everted edges. A general cachexia from the pain and wasting discharges will soon show itself, and more or less distinct evidences of the complication of other organs become apparent. Under such circumstances, the end i3 not far off, for the disease has run its course, and with it the powers of its victim have become undermined, for the victory remains with the Fig. 401. Tuberous cancer.CANCER OF THE BREAST. 253 strongest. In a general way, a cancer runs its course in two or three years; though sometimes it is most chronic in its action. To illustrate some of the points connected with this subject the following analysis of 400 cases may he of value. The cases are taken from my own notes; 180 occurred in Guy’s during the period of my registrarship many years ago, and 220 are from my own case- book since. The disease made its first appearance— In 17 cases, or 4 per cent., under 30 years of age. In 108 „ or 27 per cent., between 31 and 40 years of age.

Of these 313 were married, 77 were single, and 10 were widows. Social Of the 313 married, 235 were prolific and 78 sterile. A large cond'tion- proportion of the prolific women were so to an extreme degree, ten and Prolific or more children being a common note to find recorded. Married women sterile, and those in whom the gland has been the most active, are apparently more liable to cancer of the breast than the single when the period of gland activity has passed. 194 of these examples were in the right breast, 187 in the left, and side affected. 19 in both. In 140 the disease had existed a year or less. Duration of disease. In 99 between 1 and 2 years.

With respect to any hereditary history of cancer in the 400 Hereditary cases, although carefully inquired into, I found it to exist in only 47 history, or nearly 12 per cent.; and, in 35 of these cancer was reported to have occurred in one member, in 11 in two members, and in one in three. In 7 of the 47 cases the relative was on the father’s side, in 23 on the mother’s, and in 7 it was found among the brothers or sisters. In 5, it bad attacked the aunts, in 3, cousins, and in 1 a grandmother, although in these the point was not stated respecting the paternal or maternal relation. These facts are enough to indicate that where an hereditary tendency exists, it is more powerful on the mother’s than the father’s side. In a large proportion of the cases in which an hereditary history of cancer was traced, the cancer was of the breast. A section of an infiltrating cancer is well shown in Fig. 402. A section of the tuberous form in Fig. 403. For the microscopical appearances of cancer vide Fig. 32.

In it, the clinical features of the affection were those of the cystic disease. It is found in the gland as an infiltrating and tuberous growth. Fig. 402. Infiltrating cancer of the breast. Drawing 409* Guy’s Mus., Birkett’s case. Fig. 403. Tuberous cancer. Birkett’s case. To the eye, the colloid disease has a peculiar aspect, its jelly-like semi- transparent material of all tints of pink and red from degrees of blood-staining being divided by thin meshes of fibre tissue into cells of different sizes. The way the jelly-like structure oozes from its cells, and the slight changes that take place in it after immersion in spirit, are its chief characteristics. It ought to be treated by excision of the whole gland. Cystic Tumour of the Breast. The simple sero-cyst is usually found single in the mammary gland, and appears as a small hard lump in one spot which is at times painful, but often not. As it increases it becomes more globular and dense, sometimes being of a stony hardness; while at a still later date, it may afford the sensation of fluctuation. If left alone, it may so enlarge as to come forward and even burst, discharging a thin watery non- albuminous fluid, and then collapsing. In rare cases, the disease is thus cured ; but more commonly, the fluid re-accumulates. “ The cyst wall of this tumour,” writes Birkett, “ is very thin, com- posed of fibre tissue, firmly attached to the surrounding parts, and linedCYSTIC DISEASE OF THE BREAST. 255 with squamous epithelium. It is always perfectly closed, and never communicates with a duct.” Such a cyst should be punctured with a trocar and canula and some Treatment, cold lotion' applied, for, by this means many are permanently cured. Brodie employed alone, without puncture, a lotion made up of an ounce of the solution of the subacetate of lead and three ounces and a half of both spirits of wine and camphor, which was to be applied on a piece of folded flannel, and renewed every three or four hours until the skin over the tumour had become inflamed; the application to be re-applied after the lapse of two or three days. Besides the simple serous cyst, many examples of tumours of the Spurious breast come under the observation of the surgeon, the diagnosis of 0’stother which is much obscured by the presence of cysts, or rather of what Mr. aj^aae>0f Birkett describes as capsules, containing fluid of divers characters breast. For the development of a cyst in the majority of tumours is a mere accident due to the effusion of fluid, probably serum, more or less blood-stained into the connective-tissue of the part the fluid sepa- rating the solid growth and so forming an apparent cyst. Such a cyst however, is not a new development, like the more solid portion of a tumour, nor is it in any way to be compared with the simple cystic formations which are found in the neck or other portions of the body. Characters. The existence of the false cysts, therefore, such as I have briefly sketched, in any of the breast tumours, whether adenoid or malignant, is to be regarded as a mere accident, and ought to have no weight in determining either the innocency or malignancy of the growth under Cysts as a examination; they are the product of a mechanical cause, may means of occur in either form, are not special growths nor of any intrinsic thagnosis- importance. The diagnosis of the tumour containing such cysts rests consequently on other points, and more particularly on such as have been already indicated. As a rule, these so-called cysts are found in the less firm and solid forms of tumour in such as contain less cellular or connective tissue, and in the more rapidly developed rather than in the slowly formed. We thus find in one form of cystic Cystic adenoma, a more or less solid tumour, the growth being more lobulated and loosely connected where the false cysts or cap- sules exist. In a second class of cases loose pedunculated growths will be seen lying within these capsules, with their floating extremities bathed with the so- called cyst contents (Fig. 404). The dif- ferent forms assumed by these tumours de- pending upon the amount of connective tissue which binds Fig. 404. adenoma. Pedunculated growths in cysts.

In all, the ele- mentary structure of the growths whether these are dense and compact, loose and pedunculated, within false cysts or in dilated ducts, simulates the structure of normal gland tissue. In some, the csecal terminations of the ducts are the most prominent, and in others, the ducts and sinuses; while in a few true milk or cream secretion exists, precisely similar to that secreted by the breast. In fig. 404 every variety of this affection can be seen. In all probability, however, all adenomata are developed in cysts as intra-cystic growths. Dr. Goodhart, in an able paper has supported this view (‘Edin. Med. Journ.,’ 1872). Cystic Cancer. Cy9ts in cancer. Diagnosis of true cystic adenocele. Special characters. Is an inno- cent growth. The pathology of cystic cancer is identical with that of cystic adenoma, while the cysts in the one instance contain the more or less solid characteristic lobules of the adenoid growth, and in the other, are filled with the less developed and more irregular, but equally charac- teristic material which goes to build up the cancerous tumour. The diagnosis of these cancers rests, therefore, upon such points as have been already described under a former heading. On the Diagnosis of the “ True Cystic Adenocele” of the Breast. The remarks which have been already made respecting the importance of cysts in the innocent and malignant tumours of the breast are not applicable to all cases; inasmuch as to this rule, as well as to others there is an exception, and in the present case, the exception is to be found in that form of cystic disease of the mammary gland which is essentially a cystic disease of the gland itself, and more particularly its secreting ducts, differing in this way from the other forms of cystic adenocele which are new growths, developed independently of though allied in structure to the breast-gland itself. This true cystic adenocele, however, is of an innocent nature and pathologically allied to the genuine adenocele. It is the tumour originally described by Sir B. Brodie as “ arising by a dilatation of portions of some of the lactiferous tubes,” and, by Mr. Birkett, as duct-cysts distinctly referable to the dilatation of a duct, or to a connection with one, and containing growths which appear to spring from their walls, and these two forms of cystic adenocele are strictly analogous in their nature. In both, the pedunculated or floating bodies possess a structure allied to the breast-gland, and are composed of more or less distinct csecal terminations of newly developed ducts with variable quantities of true connective tissue. This affection is more common in middle than in young life, for out of 14 cases 3 only occurred in women under 30; in 11, in women over 40, while 1 was as old as 71 0 Path. Trans.,’ vol. xvii, p. 283). How, then, is such a tumour to be made out ? and what are the special 'symptoms which characterise it from the other forms of mam- mary tumour ? First of all, being an innocent tumour, it will be found to affect the patient in a purely local manner as all other adenoid tumours. It is a local disease, which at no period of its growthOPEN TUMOURS OF THE BREAST. 257 and in no way will affect the patient otherwise than through local causes. It is never associated with secondary glandular enlargements or with deposits in other tissues, as the cancerous tumour, and it can, therefore, be by local symptoms only that a correct diagnosis is to be made. The tumour, being a genuine cystic disease, is always made up of Made up of cysts filled with intra-cystic growths in different degrees, and it is also c-3 s' a disease of the gland itself, the cysts having a distinct relation with the gland ducts. The cysts having, therefore, in the majority, if not in A disease of all cases, some communication through the nipple with the external an surface, can be partially emptied of their contents by pressure through the nipple of the affected organ. As a result, this discharge from the nipple must always materially tend to confirm the impressions which may have been formed by the careful observation of the case, and by the presence of those conditions to which attention has just been drawn. Consequently a cystic tumour of the mammary gland in a healthy Summary, woman, unattended by any other than local symptoms, and associated with the discharge of a clear or coloured viscid secretion from the nipple, which can be induced or materially increased by pressure, may, with considerable confidence, be set down as the true cystic adenocele of the breast. The false adenoceles or other tumours, which have but little if any connection with the true gland-tissue, are new growths partaking of the nature of the breast-gland, according to the universal pathological law, that all new growths partake of the nature and pecu- liarities of the structure in which they are developed. Galactocele. p This is a milk tumour found in the breast during lactation, the Galactocele. result of some retention of milk in an obstructed or ruptured duct, the secretion being either fluid milk-like, or more solid and creamy, owing to the absorption of the more fluid elements. Prep. 2290s0 229090, and 229940, Guy’s Museum, illustrate these points. It usually occurs somewhat suddenly during suckling, and is indicated by a painless fluctuating swelling, unaccompanied by any constitutional disturbance.- These cysts at times attain a large size. Scarpa has recorded a case in which two pints of milk were removed from the tumour. It should be treated by an incision into the cyst, leaving the walls of the cavity to granulate. Other Tumours of Breast. Adenomata or adenoceles, cystic or otherwise, are not, however, the Sarcomatous only innocent tumours of the breast, as the sarcomatous are occa- tumours, i sionally met with; these being generally more succulent and less solid I than the adenomata and more rapid in their growth, while they have j also a greater tendency to return after removal.

They are more closely i connected with the breast than the adenomata, although they do ; not infiltrate it like the cancers. They run their course moreover more ii rapidly than the former and have a tendency to break down, giving i rise to a bleeding mass of tissue which may he mistaken for a cancer. • They are also local, and are rarely associated with any secondary i grandular enlargement. They should be dealt with as adenomata and •i‘ removed. VOL. II. 17TUMOURS OF THE BREAST. 258 On hydatid cysts. Nrevus of the breast. Open cancerous ulcer. Hydatid cysts are found in the breasts, but are not common. Only one example has fallen into my hands, although I have seen two others in the practice of my colleagues. My own patient was a woman, set. 30, who for five years had had a painless globular swelling in her left breast, and when I saw her it was as large as a cocoa-nut. I tapped the cyst and evacuated sixteen ounces of a clear non-albuminous fluid, and, as it was evidently the fluid of a hydatid, I made a free incision into the tumour and turned out a large acephalocyst; the patient made a good recovery. Ncevus, involving the whole mammary gland, may be met with. I have had under my care a splendid example in a girl, six years old, in which the whole organ was like a sponge and as large as half an orange. On the open, ulcerating, and discharging tumour of the breast.— In the growth of any tumour situated in the mammary gland or its neighbourhood, there must be a period when the integuments will become so involved as to ulcerate or give way, and, under these circumstances, a discharging surface or cavity will present itself, varying in its aspect according to the innocency or malignancy of the growth with which it is associated. If the tumour is cancerous the open surface or dis- charging orifice will suggest its nature, and the integument itself or the margins of the wound will be infiltrated with cancerous material, the latter presenting the thickened, indurated, and everted margin so characteristic of the cancerous ulcer, and which, when once seen and appreciated, can hardly he mistaken (Fig. 405). But if the tumour he innocent, a very different condition will present itself, for a clear understanding of which, it is essential to recall one or two points of difference between the innocent and malignant tumours, although at- tention may previously have been drawn to them in former pages. It is the peculiar nature of the innocent tumour to affect the part in Fig. 405. Fig. 406. Open cancer of breaBt, with infiltration of skin. Model, Guy’s Mus.

On the other hand, it is the peculiar nature of the cancerous or malignant to infiltrate and involve every tissue with which it 'comes in contact. Applying, therefore, these two opposite features of the innocent and malignant tumours to gumm 0f the classof cases now under consideration, we shall readily understand how ° two very different local appearances may be produced; and how in the distinct cystic cancerous disease, the wound or surface will be characterised by characters, all the peculiarities of the cancerous ulcer, and in the cystic innocent tumour which may have ruptured from over distension, the margin of the wound or discharging cavity will look healthy, free from all ap- pearance of infiltration, and rather as if mechanically cut or punched out than ulcerated. In the cystic adenoceles in which it is not uncommon to Cystic find a sprouting and discharging intra-cystic growth protruding from adenoma, a wound through the ruptured integument, and presenting a very doubtful and sometimes cancerous aspect, the importance of this symptom cannot be overrated, for if found projecting through an orifice of the integument which is uuinfiltrated and apparently healthy such as we have already described, the innocent nature of the tumour may with some confidence be declared (Pig. 406). On the value of the Retracted Nipple as a Symptom in Tumours of the Breast. There can be little doubt that as a positive indication of can- Retracted cerous disease, the importance of a retracted nipple has been considerably nipple as ti overrated ; and that, although the symptom may be common in infil- 8y|uPtom- trating cancer of the breast, such a disease may exist without it; it may be present, moreover, in simple non-cancerous affections. For a re- Retracted trncted nipple may be regarded as an accidental symptom in the de- velopmentof a tumour, ns well as the product of mechanical causes, its syinptoui. presence being determined rather by the manner in which the gland is involved than by the nature of the disease. If any tumour, simple or malignant—any abscess, chronic or acute—attack the centre of the mammary gland, a retracted nipple in all probability will be produced; for as a disease so placed, necessarily causes material separation of the gland-ducts, their extremities, terminating in the nipple, will be drawn upon, and, as a consequence, a retracted nipple must follow. We thus find this symptom of frequent occurrence in the early stage of an infiltrating cancer of the organ, the nipple being always drawn towards the side of the gland which may be involved ; while at a later stage, when the infiltration is more complete, the nipple may again project. In a central chronic abscess of the breast, the retracted nipple is equally common, and in the true cystic adenocele it may be also present. In the ordinary adenocele, whether cystic or otherwise, it is rarely met with, for the reason that this disease is not of the breast-gland itself, but only situated in its neighbourhood. In rare cases, however, such an association may co-exist, and in one case in which I observed it, some blow or injury had preceded the development of the adenoid tumour, and it was open to a doubt whether the re- tracted nipple had not been brought about by some chronic inflam- matory condition. It should always be remembered, moreover, that a contracted nipple may be a natural condition.260 ON CHRONIC DISEASE OP THE NIPPLE. On the value of a discharge from the nipple for diagnostic purposes. —When the discharge is slight or of a bloody nature, it does not indi- cate any special affection, though it is well known that in cancerous affections a discharge from the nipple is not unfrequent, the fluid having the appearance of blood-coloured serum, which is never profuse, and rarely amounts to more than a few drops. In the true cystic adenoceles, this symptom is of considerable value, for in all the cases which have passed under my observation, as well as in the majority of recorded ex- amples, this discharge from the nipple was a prominent symptom, the fluid being generally of a mucoid nature, and more or less blood-stained; and, although at times it occurred spontaneously and with relief to the patient, at others it could readily be induced by some slight pressure In adenocele. uPon the parts. In the ordinary adenoceles, this symptom is seldom present. It exists therefore as a symptom in the true disease of the breast structure, whether cancerous or adenoid; and while slight and uncertain in the former, it is more general and copious in the latter; consequently as a means of diagnosis it is of some value. On Chronic Disease of the Mammary Areola preceding Cancer. On disease of Sir J. Paget has recently pointed out (‘ St. Bartliol. Hosp. Reps.,’ areoiaT^ v°l- x> 1874), what my own experience confirms, that cancer of the cancer.m breast is sometimes preceded by a chronic skin disease of the nipple and areola; the disease in the majority of the fifteen cases in which he had observed it having “ the appearance of a florid, intensely red, raw surface, very finely granular, as if nearly the whole thickness of the epidermis were removed; like the surface of very acute diffused eczema, or like that of an acute balanitis. From such a surface there was always copious, clear, yellowish, viscid exudation.” In some cases, the eruption has presented the characters of an ordinary chronic eczema or psoriasis, the eruption spreading beyond the areola in widening circles, or with scattered blotches of redness covering nearly the whole breast. “ The eruption has resisted all treatment, both local and general, and has continued even after the affected part of the skin has been involved in the cancerous disease.” “ The cancer has always been in the substance of the mammary gland, beneath or not far from the diseased skin, and always with a clear interval of apparently healthy tissue.” Micro- Mr. Henry Butlin has also shown, that these changes are due to an scopical extension of the disease from the surface of the nipple to the smaller appearances. a]Kj acjnj 0f t}ie giand, these parts being found filled on micro- scopical examination with proliferating epithelium which at times escapes from the ducts by rupture or growth into the surrounding tissues—thereby producing the full formation of carcinoma (‘ Roy.

When some enlai’gement of the axillary or clavicular glands exists On enlarged with a chronic tumour of the breast, the malignant nature of the disease 8 is rendered probable; for the simple adenomata are generally unat- tended by such a complication, and with the cystic affections it is also rare. Many months, however, may elapse in cases of cancer of the breast before the appearance of this symptom, because enlargement of the absorbent glands and infiltration of the skin have some connection. In cancerous affections, the enlargement of the glands is indolent and very painless. In the inflammatory affections of the organ, glan- dular enlargement and tenderness are commonly present. On the value of the Tubercular and General Infiltration of the Inte- qd gnment over the Breast. tubercular When the integument of a breast is sparsely or thickly studded with infiitmtbn'L shot or pealike tubercular infiltrations, or is so infiltrated with netv a symptom, material as to present a brawn-like feel and aspect, there can be no question as to the cancerous nature of the disease, since such a symptom is never present in any inflammatory or simple disease of the mammary gland. The infiltration may be slight, from the mere shot- or pea-like affection of the skin, to its more brawny infiltration ; but in all ;i stages it is equally characteristic, and speaks in positive language of i the cancerous nature of the mammary growth, one tubercle telling ‘ as plain a tale as if many tubercles existed. Cachexia.—I have no belief in the existence of a special cancerous Cachexia ns a cachexia. A cachexia may be present in cancer as in any exhausting or symptom, wasting disease; hut that of cancer differs in no single point from that of any other affection. When a cachexia exists, it indicates the pre- sence of some affection which is undermining the patient’s strength, which may he cancer, hut, it may be any other form of disease. On Excision of the Breast. There is no great danger attending excision of the breast beyond On excision that which accompanies any, even the smallest, operation. It is true of the breast, that patients occasionally sink after the operation from pyaemia, ery- sipelas, or visceral diseases, hut these contingencies attend any operation for wound ; from the excision itself there is little danger to life. From Mortality in my notes of 133 cases of cancer in which excision was carried out I excision.' find that nine died, or about 6'7 per cent., while in three only, or 2-2 per cent., could the death be ascribed to the operation. One c nisea of died from pyaemia, on the thirty-fifth day; one from erysipelas, con- death, tracted several months after the operation, when the wound had healed ; two from acute bronchitis, three weeks and a month respect- r ively after the excision; one from profuse diarrhoea, on the eighth day, probably pysemic; one from haemoptysis in the third week; two from I exhaustion after a return of the growth, in three and six months; and > one from actual sinking after the operation on the third day. The ) three cases which died from pyaamia and diarrhoea which was also ( probably pysemic, and the one which sank on the third day may, i perhaps, with justice he directly assigned to the operation, but the i fatal termination in the remaining six examples had no reference what- :i ever to the excision.

In operating for cancer, it is un- to beC , eHSt questionably the wisest course, as a rule, to excise the whole gland; when the tumour is, however, very local, the rule may be broken through, and it is as well not to be over-anxious about preserving too much integument, for if any doubt exists as to its perfect healthiness, the suspected portion had better be excised. When enlarged glands exist, it is wise to take them away. It is always important, when dissecting out the tumour, to keep clear of all diseased tissues, and, in fat subjects, to leave a fair covering between the incision and the tumour itself, as there is good reason to believe that an early return of the affection is too often to be explained by want of attention to these points. In several instances, 1 have found small cancerous nodules in the fascia over the pectoral muscle, which if left would have been the centre of new growths. In the operation for adenoceie, it is quite ex- ceptional for the removal of the breast to be necessary, and in the majority of instances, such a practice would be clearly unjustifiable. As a rule, the tumour is readily removed on making a clean section through its cyst-wall and enucleating the growth; the breast is rarely injured, even by the operation. In exceptional examples of this affec- tion, however, it is absolutely necessary that the breast-gland should be excised, that is, where a large tumour is closely connected with it, as well as in the genuine or true cystic adenoceie of the mammary gland. In the removal of a small tumour not involving the breast the best practice is to make the incision in a line radiating from the nipple, and to manipu- late the parts as little as possible; the surest plan being to cut well into the tumour after having raised and made it prominent by grasping its base with the thumb and finger of the opposite hand. The Operation.—In the removal of a breast, the patient should he placed on her back with the shoulder of the affected side raised by a pillow and the arm drawn out at a right angle to the body. The inci- sion should be elliptical and made in a line parallel with the fibres of the pectoral muscle, and, when the skin is diseased,it should be removed. The inner or sternal incision should then be made, and bleeding con- trolled by the pressure of the fingers of an assistant. The second incision may then follow, and should be made down to the free border of the pectoral muscle, the definite form of which is the best and surest guide to the base of the gland. The whole tumour by these means is thus readily excised, a few touches of the scalpel dissecting it off the pectoral muscle. The axillary angle of the tumour should be divided last, as it usually contains the chief vessels that supply the gland. All bleeding vessels should be twisted, the surface of the wound cleaned, its edges well adjusted, a drainage tube introduced at the most dependent part when the wound is large, and steady pressure applied by means of pads of lint, gauze, or cotton wool. Adenoid or innocent tumours should be excised only when they are steadily increasing, and are sources of trouble. Cancerous tumours should be removed as soon as the diagnosis of their existence is clear, for accumulated evidence tends to show, that the earlier a cancer is removed the better are the prospects of a complete or lengthened immunity from the disease, and that whether the disease returns soon or late, the best chance is thus afforded to the patient. Description of the operation for excising the breast.263 DIAGNOSIS OF OVARIAN TUMOURS. CHAPTER XXVII. ON OVARIAN DISEASE AND OVARIOTOMY. The ovaries are glands, and are developed as other glands, being composed of like elements. In them during infancy and childhood, although cell growth and even cell shedding may go on, such processes take place silently, unattended by any external manifestations of their action. At puberty, however, when the ovum has matured and impreg- nation become impossible, external signs of these changes appear with menstruation, and with these changes, functional disturbances of the ovaries and parts connected with them occur which may require the attention of the physician. The surgeon’s aid is only called for when organic ovarian disease exists, and the nature of this aid varies with the nature of the case. Ovarian disease is a somewhat common affection, and, although Ovarian mostly met with during the active period of ovarian life, it occurs in dlsu,se- childhood and mature age. Two specimens now in the College of Surgeons were taken from twin children five and eight weeks re- spectively by Dr. Leared, and a rare preparation at Prague shows a cyst in the ovary of a child a year old. Spencer Wells has recorded a successful case of ovariotomy in a child mt. eight, Dr. Barker, of Philadelphia, had another in one aged six years and eight months. I have recorded two cases in which girls aged respectively fifteen and sixteen sank after tapping from suppuration of the cyst; and in 1869,1 published in the ‘ Guy’s Hospital Reports ’ a case in which I successfully removed a polycystic ovarian tumour from a child aged fourteen, in whom no signs of puberty existed. But these instances are exceptional, and ovarian disease is essentially an affection of mature adult life. Ovarian tumours may be clinically divided into four classes:—Mono- cystic, or unilocular tumours, polycystic, or multilocular tumours, dermoid cysts, and, cancerous tumours. The relative frequency of these different forms of tumours is well seen in the following conclu- sions that were drawn up after a careful examination of the records of 88 fatal cases of ovarian disease, extracted for me by the late Dr. Phillips from the Guy’s Records, and copied from my work ‘ On Ovario- tomy’ published in 1867.

That about 70 per cent, of the cases are in married women, and that the disease is most frequent between the age of twenty and forty, or during the vigour of sexual life. 5.

Diagnosis of ovarian tumour. cases, within two years; 30 per cent, dying from exhaustion, 20 per cent, from peritonitis, 17 per cent, from suppuration of the cyst chiefly following tapping, 9 per cent, from the two last causes combined, 10 per cent, from peritonitis caused by rupture of the cyst, 10 per cent, from the cyst ulcerating into some viscus such as the intestine or bladder. Haemorrhage into the abdomen and strangulation of the bowels by the pedicle caused death in 1 case in the 100. 6. That in the monocystio tumours there is a greater disposition for the cyst to ulcerate into the bowels than in other cases, and to suppu- rate after tapping. 7. That in 56 per cent, of the cases of cancerous disease, both organs are involved. 8. That in the dermoid tumours there is a greater disposition for the cyst to rupture than in all other forms of disease, death being directly due to this cause in 37 per cent. 9. That acute peritonitis and suppuration of the cyst as a direct result of the operation of tapping is by no means unfrequent. Cases of spontaneous recovery occur, but they are so rare that they must not be looked for. When they occur they take place by rupture of the cyst, and this rupture is generally the result of accident or violent muscular action. As a rule, however, when a cyst ruptures, death takes place from shock, peritonitis, or blood poisoning (vide conclusion 5). In exceptional cases, when the cyst has discharged itself into the large intestine, the event may be signified by a copious dis- charge of the cyst’s contents by the rectum; but when into the small no such event may occur, the fluid being reabsorbed. Under both circumstances, there is always great danger to life from the entrance into the cyst itself of Decal matter or fetid air. Diagnosis of an Ovarian Tumour. When an ovarian tumour has attained a considerable size, has risen well out of the pelvis, and is uuassociated with any complications, its diagnosis is not difficult, as a rule, more particularly if it can be made out to be composed of many cysts or multilocular. But when the tumour is small or very large; unilocular or very solid; central or of rapid growth, difficulties of diagnosis are met with, and it may be admitted at once that under any of these circum- stances, there are few surgical cases that demand more care on the part of the surgeon before he gives an opinion, and still more caution before he acts upon it. In some few instances, indeed, a positive dia- gnosis cannot be made without the help'of some exploratory operative proceeding. Under all circumstances, however, “in the diagnosis of a suspected ovarian case every possibility of its nature should be enter- tained, and a conclusion arrived at by a process of exclusion; each possibility should be separately considered and weighed, and the most probable finally accepted.” The possibility of a solid or semi-solid tumour being due to preg- nancy, and the probability of a cystic tumour being complicated with it or hydramnion ought always to be before the mind of the surgeon, while the complete cessation of the menses for a few mouths in con- nection with the existence of an abdominal tumour ought also. to suggest caution in diagnosis, and, when for diagnostic or curative ends operative measures are being considered, delay, since thoughDIAGNOSIS OP OVARIAN TUMOURS. 265 catamenial irregularity is common in ovarian disease, total arrest for any time is rare. The early history of an ovarian case is always obscure, and the Diagnosis of statements of patients concerning its early growth must be accepted ovarian with caution. In a general way, the tumour is discovered by accident, tuluuur. or, attention is first drawn to its presence by abdominal enlargement. Pain is rarely present in the early stage of the disease, and when it exists is usually the result of mechanical causes; that is, it is due to the impaction of a small ovarian tumour in the pelvis, or to the pressure of a larger one upon the viscera, vessels, or nerves. When the tumour presses upon the bladder, incontinence of urine or dysuria will occur; but when it irritates the bowels, diarrhoea. When it drags upon the omentum or presses upon the stomach, nausea and vomiting may be present, and where it encroaches upon the thorax, dyspnoea. Nerve pains will be produced according to the nerves that are pressed upon, and oedema of the genitals, legs, or abdomen, accord- ing to the amount of interference to the return of venous blood caused by the tumour. (Edema of the abdominal walls is said to be typical of cancerous disease of the ovaries, but this is not the case, since I have seen this symptom very frequently in undoubted examples of simple ovarian disease. Local pain, pyrexia, with a high temperature and abdominal ten- derness associated with a cystic abdominal tumour, generally indicate inflammatory changes within an ovarian cyst. Dermoid tumours are said to be more commonly attended with pain than airy other, and unilocular cysts with less, though I cannot confirm the former observation. In well-marked examples of ovarian disease the face becomes pinched Ovarian and the peculiar “ovarian expression ” manifests itself, but after the expression, removal of the tumour by ovariotomy, it is remarkable how soon this expression disappears. The differential diagnosis of an ovarian tumour will now occupy our Differential attention, and its physical signs will be first considered as made out by diagnosis, percussion and palpation, since it is by these more than any others that the surgeon is generally led to an approximate opinion of the nature of the case. Too much confidence, however, must not be placed on them, since they are only of value when taken in connection with other symptoms. In all cases of suspected ovariau disease, the patient to be examined Inspection, should be undressed and then placed on her back. The surgeon should afterwards so expose the abdomen as to be able to have a good look at it and observe whether the abdominal enlargement is central or lateral smooth, irregular, or nodular in outline; be should view it also for a sufficient time to satisfy himself that the outline is stationary and that it does not shift. He should then place his hand flat upon the abdomen and having rested it there for a minute or so to test the points iust alluded to, move it steadily over the whole surface of the tumour in all directions, and, at the same time by palpation, ascertain something of n , the condition of the deeper parts. ° Palpation. By these means, much will have been ascertained as to the nature of the case. It will have been made out whether a tumour exists or not • something will have been learnt, too, concerning its size and mobility and whether it is solid, fluid, or the two combined. 3266 DIAGNOSIS OF OVARIAN TUMOURS. Percussion. Possibilities of case. Value of resonance. Pelvic examination. The surgeon should then proceed to percuss the parts, doing this at first superficially and then deeply. He should also examine for fluctua- tion ; asking himself during the whole examination the following questions—Is this abdominal enlargement due to tympanitis or some phantom—that is, muscular—tumour ? Is it due to, or complicated with pregnancy, or is it uterine or ovarian disease ? Can it be a hydatid, renal cyst, or an enlarged viscus such as spleen or kidney ? Is it a cancerous tumour P A fluctuating tumour rising from the pelvis in a central position yielding a dull note on superficial as well as on deep percussion, with epigastric and lumbar resonance, is probably a cystic ovarian growth, and, when the tumour fluctuates in all directions, as is proved by the peculiar thrill of the wave elicited on percussion, the growth is probably unilocular or monocystic. When the tumour has an irregular or botryoidal outline, and fluctuation is confined to parts, it is certainly compound, the degrees of solidity in a compound or multilocular tumour varying greatly. If the tumour seem to be a unilocular or monocystic growth, the surgeon must remember that ovarian tumours of this kind are comparatively rare, and that those which appear to be such often contain some intracystic growths. He should also know that purely unilocular cysts are probably broad ligament cysts or par- ovarian, that is, a cystic degeneration of the tubules of the Wolffian body, although multilocular parovarian tumours have been recorded. If the tumour be clearly cystic and multilocular, the probabilities are that it is ovarian, and if more solid than cystic, uterine. Uterine and ovarian tumours yield a dull note on deep percussion, and, as in these cases the intestines are pushed upwards and towards the loins, these regions are consequently resonant, and no alteration in the position of the patient will alter this fact. In ascites, with the shoulders of the patient raised, the lower portion of the abdomen may likewise yield a dull sound, but with the shoulders depressed and the hips raised, resonance will be made out, the bowels naturally floating on the surface of the ascitic liquid. In ascites, the central portion of the abdomen is resonant and the sides dull, whereas in ovarian dropsy it is the reverse. When the intestines, however, are matted together from cancerous or old peritoneal disease, difficulties occur, and errors in diagnosis can only be avoided by going carefully into the clinical history of the case and by a pelvic examination. In ovarian disease a friction sound may be detected at times on aus- cultation or on the application of the hand, while in ascites no such symptom will be present. On the Diagnostic Value of a Pelvic Examination in Ovarian Disease. The diagnosis of an ovarian tumour can hardly ever be said to be complete until a pelvic examination by means of the finger and uterine sound has been made, and the combined examination between the abdominal wall and rectum, for which purpose the patient had better be placed on her side. When the uterus is found to be in front of and distinct from the abdominal tumour and moveable without it, the growth is piobably ovarian.267 DIAGNOSIS OF OVARIAN TUMOURS. When the tumour and uterus move together, or, if the uterus be drawn up out of the pelvis, difficulties in diagnosis may be experienced. If the tumour be cystic, it may be ovarian with a short pedicle, a broad ligament or parovarian cyst, or, a cystic disease ot the uterus. When it is solid, it may still be ovarian, dermoid, fibrous, or can- cerous ; or it may be a fibrous tumour of the uterus. A fixed pelvic tumour is probably neither ovarian nor uterine, but if either, it is cancerous. In an ovarian tumour, the uterine sound will rarely go beyond its two inches, unless complicated with pregnancy or some uterine disease. In cystic disease of the uterus, it may enter for six or more. The uterine sound should not be used too hastily for diagnostic pur- Caution in poses, because when pregnancy and ovarian disease are combined, evil “sing sound, may follow its use, although it ought always to be employed before operative measures are resorted to. When ascites is present, a pelvic examination will generally detect a vaginal rectocele, that is, a bulging into the vagina of the posterior wall of the vaginal passage from the pressure of the ascitic fluid into Douglas’s pouch, and this bulging is not met with in uncomplicated ovarian disease, though it may occur when ovarian disease and ascites co-exist. I have found this point of great diagnostic value for many years, and was pleased to read that Dr. Peaslee had mentioned it as one of value. “ Solid uterine tumours,” writes Tait, “ besides the absence of fluctua- tion, have in addition two vascular signs which I have never met with in ovarian tumours, viz. an aortic impulse which may be seen and felt, and an enlargement of the uterine arteries to be felt in the vagina.” In pregnancy, there is also to be seen the peculiar purple livid con- dition of vagina which does not exist in other pelvic tumours, the changed appearance of the nipple, enlargement of the breasts, &c., &c. I have often found the rectal digital examination for diagnostic pur- I poses to be great, and particularly in young or old virgins; but I cannot speak from personal experience of the value of the introduction of the hand. Professor Simon, of Heidelberg, however, speaks highly of it. On the Value of Tapping for Diagnostic Purposes. When there is any doubt as to the true nature of a cystic abdominal Diagnostic tumour, a preliminary tapping ought to be performed, and the physical value of nature of the fluid examined, although an ovarian fluid in our present taPPin8- state of knowledge is not to be recognised by any definite physical or chemical characters. Drs. Washington Atlee and Peaslee, however, inform us that the fluid of an ovarian cyst may be distinguished from all fluids by the presence of a peculiar cell which they call the ovarian Ovarian granule-cell, which is about the size of a pus-cell, round and full of celis. granules, and Mr. Thornton has recently confirmed these observations (‘ Path. Soc.,’ March 16tli, 1875); adding, moreover, that large pear- shaped, round, or oval cells, containing a granular material with one or several large clear nuclei, with nucleoli and a number of transparent globules or vacuoles are characteristic of malignant tumours. ■When, from what appears to be a monocyst, the fluid drawn is Of fluid, clear, slightly opalescent, and limpid, of a low specific gravity, about 1005, and non-coagulable by heat or nitric acid, or if coagulable by heat the coagulum is re-dissolved upon the addition of boiling aceticON OVARIAN DISEASE AND OVARIOTOMY. 263 Pregnancy and ovarian disease. Treatment of ovarian disease. Ovariotomy a recognised operation. acid, there is a strong reason to suspect that the tumour is a broad ligament or parovarian cyst, and, under such circumstances, there is good reason to hope, that either a cure may follow the operation of paracentesis, or if not a cure, the lapse of a long interval of time before the repetition of the operation is called for. This fact was pointed out by the late Ur. F. Bird (‘Med. Times,’ July 19, 1851). When the fluid drawn off is clearly albuminous, tenacious, dark, or light coloured; when it is even watery and like that contained in the cysts last described, and is found microscopically to contain the com- pound cells or epithelial elements already referred to, the tumour is probably ovarian and ought to be removed. When the fluid drawn off is highly albuminous and coagulates spontaneously, the suspicion of the tumour being a fibro-cystic uterine one ought to be raised, though there is little doubt that the true diagnosis of a fibro-cystic uterine tumour from a polycystic ovarian can only be made out, in the majority of cases, by an exploratory inci- sion, when the absence of the pearly appearance of the ovarian and the presence of the pinkish, vascular, and fleshy aspect of the fibro-cystic, is enough to excite the surgeon’s suspicion of the uterine nature of the growth. When pregnancy and well-developed ovarian disease co-exists, tapping ought to be performed, though in cases where the operation is inad- missible, from the nature of the tumour, ovariotomy is a justifiable proceeding, Spencer Wells having performed the operation in nine cases during pregnancy, and in eight with success; it should, however, be undertaken before the fourth month (Obstet. Soc. MS., 1877). When the tumour is small it should be left alone. The Treatment of Ovarian Disease.—In the treatment of ovarian disease medicine is of little value and has no direct influence in arrest- ing its progress. It does good only by improving the general condition of the subject. The operation of tapping in unilocular cysts is, how- ever, often of great value, and at times essential. Injection of the cyst is only applicable to a small class of cases. Ovariotomy, in a general way, is the only radical cure. John Hunter clearly realised the truth of this in 1787, when he said, “ In the early stage of ovarian dropsy I would almost advise that they should be removed entirely, if the complaint can clearly be ascertained, as they otherwise will certainly kill the patient.” He adds, however, that “ electricity has been serviceable lately in diminishing the progress of the formation of the fluid in a patient I am acquainted with. How far it will be of further service I cannot say” (MS. lectures). At the present day the operation of ovariotomy is an accepted one by the profession, and is as recognised and justifiable as any other grave operation. Surgeons and physicians differ only as to the class of cases in which it is applicable, and the period at which it should be performed. British surgeons may probably claim the credit of having established this operation in spite of early difficulties and blind opposition, and the names of Lizars of Edinburgh, MacDowell of Kentucky, Jeaffreson of Framlingham, Walne, Fred. Bird, Lane, Morgan, Aston Key, Cooper, and Caesar Hawkins, of London, must ever be remembered as amongst its earliest practical promoters. Charles Clay of Manchester, however, the first great ovariotomist in this country. Brown and particularly Spencer Wells of London, Keith of Edinburgh, Koeberle of Strasburg,ON OVARIAN DISEASE AND OVARIOTOMY. 269 Skoldberg of Stockholm, and Atlee of America, with Hutchinson, and (possibly the present writer, have by successes fairly overcome all pre- judices, and rendered the operation an established and accepted one. Without going into the details of statistics which are now no more needed in this thau in other large operations, it may be confidently Successful in asserted, that the operation is not placed in too favourable a light when two out of it is said to be successful in 2 out of every 3 cases, good, bad, and lhree cases- indifferent, and in at least 3 out of 4 selected cases. Mr. Spencer Wells informs us as the result of his unrivalled experience, that out of his 900 cases 221 or 24'5 per cent, died, and T. Keith lost only 33 out of 200 cases (‘ Brit. Med. Journ.,’ June 26, 1875). Having thus decided that the operation of ovariotomy is justifiable Points for under some circumstances, and desirable under others, it may be well to £j™81<iera‘ consider what those circumstances are, under which it should be under- taken, and what are the best cases adapted for its successful practice. Are all examples of ovarian disease to be treated by extirpatiou ?— if not, which should be selected, and at what period of the progress of the disease should the operation be performed ? What cases are to be selected for operation ?—The very statement of Se,ection of this question would seem to imply, that the operation of ovariotomy is {br operation not suitable in all cases of ovarian disease, and that there are some to which it is quite inapplicable, since choice implies selection, and, as a consequence, variety, which leads us to consider what are the dif- ferent forms of ovarian disease P For surgical purposes it is sufficient ( to divide all cases into the simple and compound cysts, the former i being composed of one cavity only, the latter of many, solid material being almost always present, though varying in amount. In the simple or monocystic ovarian tumours when the diagnosis is In clear, other plans of treatment than ovariotomy are, doubtless, open to monocystic the surgeon, and among these the treatment by injection of iodine, injection of which in the hands of different men has had variable success stands iodine, foremost. M. Boinet says that out of forty-five patients suffering from this disease, thirty-one were cured, five had relapses, and nine died. Sir J. Simpson performed it in about twenty cases with good success, only one case dying; while Dr. Tyler Smith found that out of ten cases in which this practice was followed two only were satisfactory, and two died. Dr. West in eight cases had one cured. Still, this plan of treatment is uncertain; it may cure in excep- Injection tional cases, and does not generally meet with much favour; but in un(rcrtain the majority it does no good, and may even be followed by a fatal from'danger result. It is applicable only to simple cases of monocystic disease, and is quite inapplicable and useless in the multilocular tumour, and where much solid growth exists. A similar ovarian cyst uncomplicated with the development of Monocysts smaller cysts within its walls, and uuassociated with any solid growth, unc<mipli- is unquestionably a somewhat rare affection. Such cysts are, however* cated are occasionally found, and examples have fallen under my own observation* ^ but they are not common. The majority of cysts, even those which* appear to be simple, possessing the remarkable power of reproducing other cysts within their walls, aud being, as Sir J. Paget originally described them, proliferous cysts. The majority of the pure unilocular cysts are broad ligament cysts or parovarian, and in them a cure occasionally follows a simple tapping.ON OVARIAN DISEASE AND OVARIOTOMY. 270 Fibrous or solid ovarian tumours. Multilocular disease varied conditions. Injections inapplicable. Tapping only a temporary measure. May prove fatal. May cause after- adhesions. May be employed for diagnostic purposes. Among the cases which have been tabulated as monocystic tumours —only nine per cent, of the whole number—many doubtless were of the proliferous kind, and in these, the treatment by injection is not to be advised. The treatment by iodine injection should, however, always be enter- tained by the surgeon in every case of apparent monocystic ovarian disease, while the circumstances of each individual case can alone determine what course ought to be taken. Of the fibrous or solid tumours of the ovary, little need be said, as they seldom develope to any size or interfere to any great extent with the patient’s comfort, while the expediency of their removal has rarely to be entertained by the surgeon. Should they, however, become cum- bersome by their size, the expediency of their removal must be enter- tained, and decided upon as in other cases. In all other forms of ovarian disease, in the multilocular or poly- cystic, composite, adenoid, or cysto-sarcomatous, as they have been variously called; in all which are made up of many cysts and of a variable quantity of solid material, such cases forming, indeed, the bulk of those coming under observation; there is no treatment which appears to be of any material benefit, none which seems to have any influence in retarding the growth of the disease, in palliating its inconveniences, or averting its end. The treatment by iodine injection is obviously inapplicable to them, and there is nothing else which offers any prospect of doing permanent good. The patient must quietly sub- mit to her fate or to the alternative of an operation; and in these bearing ‘‘ the stamp of incurability upon them,” the question becomes necessarily narrowed. By means of the operation of tapping, a patient may obtain relief, which is only temporary. Within a brief period, and at uncertain inter- vals the operation will have to be repeated, and, by repetition of such means, existence may be prolonged, but in the majority of cases, this prolonged existence is miserable, and the intervals of so-called ease are, at the best, uncertain. Tapping is also at times a fatal opera- tion, in rare instances from hemorrhage into the abdomen, but more frequently from acute peritonitis and suppuration of the cyst. My own statistics prove, that these causes of death are 35’5 per cent, more frequent when tapping has been employed than when the disease has been allowed to run its course. It should be observed, also, that in all cases of tapping, parietal if not visceral adhesions are prone to take place, and, in the analysis of fatal cases, this fact is well demonstrated. Under these circumstances, is tapping to be recommended in such cases of ovarian disease as appear to be favourable examples for the operation of ovariotomy ? W ithout doubt, in the majority of cases, tapping had better not be performed. For diagnostic purposes, as already shown, it may be employed with confidence and with good effect, for it is better to run the risk, of causing the formation of adhesions and even of death by the operation of tapping, than to submit a patient to the dangers of ovariotomy when the nature of the case is not clearly understood, and the pro- priety of the removal of the growth is surrounded with doubt. In very chronic cases, it may also be adopted when the tumour is made up of one large cyst, which may be a broad ligament cyst, and therefore curable by tapping, but, under other circumstances, it is by no means271 ON OVARIAN DISEASE AND OVARIOTOMY. advisable to have recourse to the practice. Mr. Spencer Wells assures us, however, that the mortality of ovariotomy is but little aflected by tapping. When a patient has attained the point at which it is evident some- thing must be done for her relief, the diagnosis of the disease is clear, and there are no points in the case contra-indicating the capital opera- tion of ovariotomy, it is the safer practice by far to operate at once than to lose time,' which may be of value, or to risk causing the forma- tion of adhesions, which are always evils, by any such temporising means as tapping. For diagnostic purposes, in certain cases, the operation of paracentesis abdominis is of great value, as it is in others in which relief is a necessity and the operation of ovariotomy is inexpedient or inapplicable; but, under other circumstances, it is a mistake and should be avoided. Are all cases, therefore, of polycystic tumours of the ovary to be excised; and, if not, which should be rejected ? It has been already shown, that there is no hope of doing permanent good to a patient labouring under this disease by any special treatment, as there is no remedy which can be trusted to retard the growth of the tumour, or to arrest its progress. Further, there is no operation less than that of extirpation, which offers any prospect of afford- ing permanent relief, or benefit. Still, there are forms of multi- locular ovarian disease with which it would be unwise to interfere, and others with which it would be quite unjustifiable, and among these the cancerous stand pre-eminent; and, though there may be difficulty in forming an exact diagnosis as to the existence of such a cancerous growth, an approach to certainty may be made and a fair probability attained. It is not, however, to be made out by any local examination alone, for, so far as my own experience goes, there are no definite local symptoms by which a solid or semi-solid multilocular cancerous ovarian tumour can be diagnosed from one of a benign character, although, perhaps, in rare examples of cancerous disease the general outlines of the growth are more irregular or nodular. The suspicion of its cancerous nature is only to be roused by the general condition of the patient, and the natural history of the case; since in the cancerous, there will be, as a rule, more emaciation, wasting, and rapid constitutional decay than in the benign, and the disease will run its course more rapidly, although the size of the tumour may not be so great as in the simple cystic form. This rule has many exceptions, for the cancerous tumour of the ovary is very commonly a cystic disease, and there are no reasons why these cysts should not enlarge as much in the malignant as in the simple form, and in practice this is found to be the case. When solid and uncomplicated with cysts, the cancerous tumours, however, rarely attain a great size. It has been said that the oedema of the abdominal walls may be looked upon as a useful guide to indicate the cancerous nature of ovarian disease but my own personal experience does not support this view, and in the in- stances which have come under my observation in which this symptom has existed to the greatest extent and the most marked degree, there has been little doubt as to the benign nature of the disease, for the tumours in one case had existed for eight years, in another for twelve while in a third for at least thirty years, and in these three extreme ex- amples, the thickness of cedematous integument over the lower part of Ovariotomy best performed at When the operation is unjustifiable.

Hewitt’s conclusions. 272 ON OVARIAN DISEASE AND OVARIOTOMY. the abdomen might have been calculated by inches—the oedema of the skin showing itself in vesicular swellings, varying from that of a pea to a large grape. The oedema was, indeed, so great that in all these cases tapping in the median line of the abdomen, or in front, was out of the question, and a lateral position had to be selected. If, however, the organs are found to be somewhat fixed and immoveable on a pelvic examination instead of being free and mobile, the proba- bility of the growth being of a cancerous nature is much increased, for the disposition to cause infiltration of the neighbouring parts is as common in cancer of the ovary as of other parts. Cancer of the ovary is also apt to involve both organs, and from my notes of fourteen examples of disease of both ovaries, nine were cancerous; and among the cancerous there were only seven examples, or 43 per cent., in which the disease was single—the law of symmetry being observed in this as in other forms of constitutional disease. Under these circum- stances, a careful pelvic examination is a matter of such great importance that under no conditions should it be omitted, since by it alone are these points in a large proportion of cases to be made out. Are all cases of benign multilocular ovarian tumours, then, to be excised?—The answer to this question is not doubtful since the patient must be left alone to hear the inconvenience of the ovarian tumour, and endure the living death of its matured miseries and die, worn out and exhausted by the prolonged sufferings produced by its presence ; or, at some time in the progress of the disease, run the risk of the capital operation and submit to ovariotomy. Before proceeding to consider the period of the tumour’s growth at which it is desirable to undertake its extirpation, it will be well to look back on the natural history of the disease, and in- quire, what are the chances of life for a patient who is left alone ?— how long may life be prolonged under favourable circumstances ? and, what is the average period in which ovarian disease runs its course ? In discussing these points, it is needless to quote numerous author- ities, as all are tolerably agreed that the average duration of life of those who are the subjects of ovarian tumours when the disease is allowed to run its course, is two or at the utmost three years; that few live over four, and those who survive beyond that period must be re- garded as exceptional. In my own cases 75 per cent, ran their course within two years. “Taking everything into consideration,” says Dr. Graily Hewitt, in his admirable work on the diseases of women, “ we shall not be far wron°* in drawing from the published cases of Dr. Bee and JVIi. Stafford Lee the conclusion that the probable duration of a case of ovarian disease of progressive character is, in 85 or 90 per cent, of the cases, two or at the most three years ; of the apparently ‘ stationary, or chronic cases, the progress is more favourable, but in such cases the disease is liable at any moment to start into fresh activity.. 1 he first question we naturally put to ourselves when a case of the kind comes before us for decision is, Does this case belong to the fortunate series, the 10 or 15 in the 100 ? or is it one of the 90 who must die in the course of two or three years if unrelieved ? ” To the surgeon, how- ever, this question is not of so much importance, for it is not till the tumour has become by its growth so large as to raise the question ofON OVARIAN DISEASE AND OVARIOTOMY. 273 operative interference that the answer has to he given, and at such a stage of the disease this becomes of little value. Having thus clear ideas on such an important point, we may ask our- selves at what period of the tumour’s growth should the operation of ovariotomy he entertained ? I have no hesitation in answering this question, as the operation should not be entertained when the tumour is small, and causing little or no mechanical inconvenience, or, when the patient is in sound health and well able to perform all the duties of life or enjoy its pleasures. Ovariotomy should not be thought of when the patient’s general condition of health is very had or the powers feeble; when there is evidence of disease in any other organ than the ovary, and it is tolerably evident that the powers of life are unable to withstand the shock of operation, or incapable of rendering the needful reparative assistance for the re- covery of the case. It is no more to be entertained under these cir- cumstances than would any other capital operation ; since the prin- ciples which guide the surgeon iu the oi’dinary conduct of his cases, and which should scrupulously be adhered to in the practice of all operations, are applicable to ovarian disease. It is true that a surgeon is sometimes led to perform an operation in neglected hernia, certain examples of amputation for disease or accident, in the ligature of a vessel, or the excision of a tumour when suffering is severe, and, if the patient be left alone, death is certain, although the probability of saving life is almost nil. Still, it is in exceptional examples of disease or injury that such operations are per- formed, and only when there is a possibility of success being obtained by au operation, and none without. Under like circumstances, a surgeon may be called upon to perform ovariotomy; when a patient is evi- dently being worn out by the disease, and by it alone; when life’s tortures are evidently becoming unbearable, and death can be calmly looked at and even wished for; when there is even a bare possibility that, on the removal of the local disease which is clearly destroying life, the powers of the patient may rally, and that at any rate relief to the suffering will be secured; under such conditions, an operation may be admissible. With the aid of chloroform, the operation is rendered painless, and it is certainly true that the after-pains are, as a rule, marvellously little, for I have heard patients frequently say, that the pains after the operation are not severe. Under certain circumstances, consequently, the surgeon may be justified in perform- ing ovariotomy with the object of giving relief, and when only a bare possibility exists of doing more, in the same way that he may be justi- fied in doing any other operation, with the same object and a like slender hope. When evidence or even a suspicion exists that the condition of the patient is due to some disorganizing change in the cyst itself, or some suppuration, the operation should be hastened. To wait is to allow the patient to die, for any improvment in the general condition is impossible so long as the local cause of the symptoms remains. The existence of an inflamed or suppurating ovarian cyst ought to be an argument for the surgeon to operate rather than the reverse. This condition should be suspected when fixed local pain or tenderness, con- stitutional disturbance, fever, a quick pulse, anda permanently hio-h tem- perature are found; when, iu fact, the general condition of the patient vol.

Preparatory treatment. is such as to satisfy the surgeon that some local source of irritation exists. I have hitherto briefly explained when the operation is not to be undertaken, and shown when it may perhaps be justifiable in extreme cases, but the surgeon should watch himself carefully in such despe- rate cases, and not be led to undertake it without much anxious thought and earnest consideration, since operations undertaken with no reasonable prospect of success are plainly unjustifiable, unscientific, and inhumane—they degrade the surgeon and injure the profession. The public derives no benefit from the experiment, and the character of operative surgery necessarily suffers. It is well, therefore, to hear in mind the sarcasm of Cruveilhier, that “ even success does not always justify rash enterprises.” To return to our original point, let us inquire into the circum- stances under which the operation of ovariotomy should be per- formed in the majority of cases, and, after what has been written the answer to this question can hardly be regarded as difficult. For, if the reasons already given for the rejection of the operation are to be regarded as correct, it is tolerably clear, that it is to be thought of only when the tumour has, by its size, become so cumbersome as to interfere with the comfort and curtail the power of the patient to perform the duties and enjoy the pleasures of her ordinary existence ; when the general health has become affected, and the local effects of the disease are distressing; under these circumstances, and these alone, the question of operation is to be considered, and, if per- missible, to be undertaken. Electrolysis.—If recent experience, however, is to be trusted, there is good reason to believe that the treatment by electrolysis is of value, for instances of its success have been published by Dr. Fieber, of Vienna, and Dr. Semeleder (‘New York Med. Journ./ June, 1876). A weak voltaic current was used by both doctors, and the needle attached to the positive pole was introduced into the tumour, whilst the other pole was applied to the skin with a sponge or metallic electrode. This treatment was employed daily from five to ten minutes, and cures were effected by from five to twelve weeks of treatment. On the Operation of Ovariotomy. Before proceeding to consider the operation of ovariotomy, it may be well to inquire into the necessity of adopting any special treatment in the preliminary preparation of a patient who is to pass through such au ordeal; as some authors have led us to believe, that in this point of practice, there is some special power, and that success or non-success in the ultimate result of this operation may be determined by the care with which the preliminary treatment has been carried out. For my own part, I confess that I have failed to recognise the necessity of adopting any such line of practice. The principles by which we should be guided in the preliminary treat- ment of a patient about to undergo the operation of ovariotomy, need not differ in any way from those which experience has taught us to be called for, previous to any other capital operation. We should do our best to raise the standard of health by all those general hygienic and other influences which are well known to act beneficially, such as goodON OVARIOTOMY. 275 air, simple nutritious diet, a fair amount of stimulants, and the ad- Diet, ministration of some tonic. Let the patient take exercise when she can without pain, and he careful that it is kept within the limits of Exercise, fatigue, that it be taken on level ground, and that no shaking or straining be on any account allowed; and, when she is at rest, the half-reclining position ought to be usually assumed. For a day Resl a day or two before the operation, however, exercise, even when possible, or two before is not to be advised, as quiet and repose are then of some essential operation, service. As a tonic medicine, iron appears to he of real and important value, Tonics or having apparently an influence for good which other tonics do not possess. it is no more useful, however, before the operation of ovariotomy than any other capital operation, though it is as good, and I have often thought that in hospital practice wounds are less prone to inflame, and erysipelatous affections are less common under the influence of this medicine than when no such preliminary treatment has been adopted. In peritoneal operations, this point is of primary importance, and, as a consequence, the adoption of this practice should be recommended. The form of iron I prefer is the tincture of the perchloride, twenty drops of which, combined with a like quantity of spirits of chloro- form or of syrup of lemons or tolu in water, forming a pleasant draught. The bowels of the patient should be gently opened two days pre- Attention to viously by such a mild aperient as castor oil, or a draught composed tlie towels, of ten grains of rhubarb and twenty of sulphate of potash in some aromatic water, and, on the morning of operation, the large intestine should be washed out with a warm water enema, but nothing like powerful purgation should he allowed under any consideration. Care Avoid should also he observed that the catamenial period has passed for at catamenial least a week previous to the operation, as all ovarian excitement is pen° necessarily injurious at such a time, and should be avoided. I have known cases of ovariotomy, however, undertaken without any conside- ration of this point, and believe that under such circumstances an unto- ward result is to be expected In hospital practice the patient should as much as possible be iso- Isolation and lated from all others and kept in a private room in which good venti- ventilation lation exists; a special nurse should also he secured, who is not only 'e" ' a lon‘ i, entirely trustworthy, but understands how to use a female catheter, q In private practice the patient’s own house is the best for the operation, and country patients should not be brought into town unless an urgent necessity exists; as there is little doubt that the atmosphere of a large Country air city is not so conducive to the rapid reparation of a wound as fresh Prefelall'e- country air. In abdominal surgery, this influence for good is of great value, and should not be thrown away unless from necessity. The surgeon who is to operate as well as his assistant should not allow Operator and themselves, for a few days before the operation to visit the post-mor- assi.sta,lts t0 tem or dissecting room, nor should they handle any morbid prepara- motoms* i tions. Erysipelatous affections and all contagious diseases should also and t he shunned as much as possible; indeed, the same rules which are c?nta?ious ■observed by the careful obstotric practitioner re necessary to the thet?me!°l surgeon who undertakes the operation of ovariotomy ; since the same subtle poisons which are recognised by all to be hurtful to the puer- I peral woman, act with equal force upon the subject of ovarian disease,ON OVARIOTOMY. 276 when submitted to ovariotomy, and, as a consequence, should be studiously avoided. It follows, therefore, as regards the lookers-on at au operation, and all who may come in contact with the patient, that none who may bring infectious or contagious disease should on any account be admitted. The physician who is attending a case of puerperal fever is looked upon as a possible poisoner as far as con- cerns the puerperal woman. The medical attendant of a scarlet fever case, of erysipelas, or other contagious disease, should be re- garded in the same light in the presence of an ovariotomy operation, and be excluded. Hence, in hospital practice, great care is needed to exclude all such possible means of injury as have been briefly enumerated. I need hardly allude to the necessity of all bed and bedding, blankets, sheets, and hangings being perfectly fresh j all sponges being new, soft, well cleansed, scalded, and free from soap and grit; of flannel, when wanted, being fresh, and having been previously well washed in warm water ; and every instrument to be employed being scrupulously clean. The hands of the operator should likewise be thoroughly cleansed from soap just previous to the operation, and be well warmed, for manipulation with a cold hand cannot but prove injurious to an exposed peritoneum. Dr. Peaslee considers this fear of irritation from the handling of the intestines and peritoneal membrane to be so great that he bathes his hands with a preparation which he calls an artificial serum, composed of water four pints, white of egg six drachms, I and salt four drachms. This practice, however, has not been followed ] by any other operator, ofr"omRtUre The temperature of the room in which the operation is performed.— I There is still some difference of opinion on this point, among ope- rating surgeons, Dr. Clay, of Manchester, Peaslee of America, "and others, advising that the operating room be heated to 75° F. or 80° F., and a good supply of moisture engendered by the diffusion of steam, while Wells and others make no such rule. Speaking from my own experience, I have no faith in the adoption of such a practice. I would have the room heated to a comfortable temperature, 65 de- grees being amply sufficient, since a greater heat acts as a powerful depressant upon the patient, and can do no good. A warm room with good ventilation is what I always seek in preference to a hot one, with closeness. A cold damp room under all circumstances is to be condemned. ■■ Position of The position of the patient.—The horizontal position is that which j patient. patients suffering from ovarian disease can rarely assume, and when the tumour is so large as to require ovariotomy, this position becomes almost impossible. As a consequence, the half-reclining position is the most comfortable for the patient and convenient for the operating surgeon. It is the posture I have invariably adopted in the cases which have fallen into my hands, and I know of no good reason why it should be changed. Some operators have employed the sitting posture in pre- ference to any other, on account of the facility with which the turnout (an j be removed through the abdominal incision, and also on account of the advantages it gives in preventing the escape of the ovarian cyst-con- tents into the abdominal cavity. Mr. Hutchinson, for the same reason I prefers the patient to be turned partially on her side, but both these, postures are not only inconvenient to the operator, but have other Care to prevent contagion. Hospital rules in respect to operation.277 ON OVARIOTOMY. real objections which forbid their recommendation. The chief objec- tion is derived from the fact, that the same law of gravity which acts upon the tumour and its contents, facilitating its escape from the abdominal cavity, and allowing it to tumble out when the incision is made, acts as powerfully upon the abdominal viscera, and thus the disposition which always exists for the intestines to escape through the abdominal section is greatly increased, and the danger of excess of manipulation of these parts much aggravated; the difficulties of the operation, moreover, are increased. The tumour also may fall out too rapidly, and, by causing a too sudden and unexpected strain upon the pedicle, a severe and perhaps fatal rupture of some important part may follow. This evil is no slight one, and, as an argument against the practice, is of some force. Upon the whole, the advantages said to be gained by the side posture are thus counterbalanced, and, as I think, more than counterbalanced by disadvantages. The half-sitting or semi-recumbent position affords all the advan- tages which have been claimed for the other postures to which I have alluded, without their evils; for in it the tumour can readily he re- moved from the abdominal cavity, and with care, its fluid contents can without difficulty be prevented from passing into the peritoneal cavity. There is also abundant room for every manipulative act that can be required. The administration of anaesthetics in the operation and local anaes- thesia. Among the many incidental advantages which the introduction of anaesthetics has afforded beyond that of relieving pain, few are greater than that of obviating hurry, a point of critical importance in ovariotomy; and there can be little doubt, that the success of the operation has thus been greatly influenced by their use. It is true that operations for the removal of an ovarian tumour were undertaken before the introduction of any anaesthetic, but we all know how fatal were their results, and exceptional was a recovery. Those who had an opportunity of witnessing the performance of an operation under such unfavourable circumstances can hardly wonder that so many patients succumbed to the practice, although they might be surprised that any were found to convalesce. To see a patient writhing under the agonies of an abdominal section was enough to make the hardest heart turn with horror, and to witness the surgeon’s hands within the abdomen of a struggling woman, in his endeavour to remove an adherent growth, was almost sufficient to make any professional spectator decide that such an operation was really unjustifiable. How, in such a case, was it possible for a surgeon to be quiet in all his movements, gentle in his manipulations, and thoughtful over the diffi- culties which of necessity present themselves in an ovarian operation, when the cries of the patient’s agony stimulated him to expedition, and her struggles forbade gentleness ? All surgeons who have operated upon these cases will agree, that success even under favourable circum- stances is only to be acquired by attention to these points ; that hurry in any operation is always bad and unjustifiable, while in ovariotomy it is destructive; that force is never to be employed in any case where art will answer; that in ovariotomy all blind force, and dragging is to be strongly condemned; and that in a proceeding in which steadi- Some prefer a partial turning on the side.

Under these circumstances the value of some anaesthetic cannot be too highly praised, for the patient by it is not only rendered insensible to pain, but her perfect quiescence is guaranteed, and her passiveness under the hands of the operating surgeon completely ensured. The vomiting that occasionally follows the use of an anaesthetic is the only argument against its use, but it is an evil which must he endured for a positive good. By the use of the nitrous oxide gas fol- lowed up by ether, or of the chloroform mixture, of alcohol one part, chloroform two, and ether three parts, as recommended by the Chloro- form Committee of the Med.-Chir. Society, this vomiting is certainly less common than alter the use of chloroform alone, and as a general anaesthetic it should be employed. Keith prefers ether, and Wells the bichloride of methylene for the same reason. Extent of the incision into the abdominal parietes.—The temperature of the room, the position of the patient, and the propriety of the administration of chloroform having received our attention, the opera- tion itself next claims consideration, and the first thought naturally is as to the extent of abdominal incision required, as there is still a want of unanimity in the practice of different surgeons upon this point. Before commencing, the careful surgeon will see that the bladder has been emptied by means of a catheter; the linen of the patient well drawn up out of harm’s way and free from the chance of becoming soiled by the use of waterproofing; the limbs of the patient well pro- tected and kept warm by a pair of drawers, and covered by a clean sheet, either with or without a blanket. He should see also that all his assistants are carefully arranged, and special duties assigned to each, and that every instrument that may be required is clean and nigh at hand. He may then proceed to make his incision, the patient having been brought completely under the influence of an anaesthetic; though previously he should determine as to its length. From Mr. Walne, Sir J. Simpson, and Dr. Clay’s practice it might he argued that the long incision should always be adopted, since their success has been great, and in their practice the long incision has been invariably employed. From the practice of Dr. Keith, Mr. Spencer Wells, and others, the short incision would appear to he the better, for their success has at least been as good as that of Dr. Clay and others, and as a rule the short incision has been the one selected. I regard the truth as between the two extremes. When the tumour can. he removed with facility by means of a short incision, a long one is clearly not required; and, when the tumour is monocystic or nearly so and free tumour large from abdominal adhesions, it may be so removed. But when the an semi tumour is large and semi-solid, or, when adhesions exist which cannot be readily broken down by the employment of gentle traction upon the growth, it is the best practice, doubtless, to make a long incision; as by so doing the removal of the growth is much facilitated, the causes of its abdominal retention and the connection of the adhesions are satisfactorily ascertained, and, as a consequence, can be dealt with with greater safety. Vomiting does not contra- indicate use of chloroform. Extent of incision requisite. Care to have llie bladder empty. Incision may be long or short. Short preferred. tVhen solid, then long incision279 ON OVARIOTOMY. My own practice has hitherto been influenced by such a conviction; Commence and I have in all cases commenced the operation by making a short "’ith short, abdominal incision, and, in many, have been enabled to remove the ff'uecegHiry. tumour without further trouble. But in certain examples in which difficulties appeared, and in which it was clear that adhesions existed, for the breaking down of which some force would have been required, and some working in the dark called for, I have been induced to increase the length of the wound upwards, even for an inch or two beyond the umbilicus, regarding such an increase of the incision as unimportant in comparison with the evil effects of violence, and drag- ging upon the tumour for the purpose of its removal, or the blind tearing down of the abdominal or visceral adhesions which have detained the growth. I have never seen any evil effects from the long incision when made Not to under the circumstances I have just indicated, but have, beyond doubt, [^g^rowth seen the bad results of an opposite practice, of violence which has through too been employed in an attempt to remove a large growth through a small an small opening, or to tear an adherent one from its abdominal or °Pem“g- visceral connections. The incision should also always be made sufficiently low. If too Incision high, considerable traction upon the pedicle of the tumour must be ,0 *!e. .. made to bring it into sight, and, with the tumour, the uterus will also *qW' be drawn out. This traction is always injurious, and should be avoided. When the lower end of the wound is too high up, this traction of the parts becomes unavoidable; by extending the incision downwards towards the pubes to a point corresponding to the upper part of the healthy uterus or about one inch above the pubes, this evil can be prevented, and, consequently, the practice I have just advised should invariably be adopted.

When the cyst is so adherent to the abdominal parietes as to render it difficult for the surgeon to distinguish the cyst-wall itself from the parietal layer of peritoneum, the plan adopted by Mr. Spencer Wells, of emptying the cyst and seizing its posterior or upper wall from within by forceps and inverting it, is a good one, the cyst then peeling off on good traction being made. On adhesions and their treatment. When the incision through the abdominal walls has been made, and the smooth glistening surface of the visceral peritoneal covering of the tumour recognised, the surgeon may be satisfied that the abdominal cavity has been fairly opened and the tumour exposed; and, when the ovarian cyst on each respiratory act is seen to move freely within the abdomen, there is a strong probability, if not certainty, that the tumour is free, and the complication of adhesions is not likely to be severe; for, when the tumour is fixed to the abdominal walls, this mobility of the cyst is not present; and fibrous or fibro-cystic tumours of the ovary or uterus usually have a fleshy or muscular appearance. It will be well therefore to consider how these adhesions are to be treated. They may present themselves on the completion of the abdominal incision in two forms. Firstly, as forming a complete and compact union between the peritoneal covering of the cyst and the abdominal peritoneum; secondly, as loose and fibrous connective bands; and thirdly, as visceral adhesions. When a firm and compact union exists between the cyst and the abdominal peritoneal membrane, the surgeon will have lost his chief guide as to the depth of his abdominal section, and, under these circum- stances he may experience some difficulty in deciding whether the abdominal cavity lias been opened or not; he must consequently be careful in his procedure, for lie is not far from the possibility of per- petrating a fatal error—the separation of the parietal peritoneum from its muscular connections; but this error, however, can be avoided by merely extending the abdominal incision upwards, until the distinct line of separation between the cyst-wall and the abdominal peritoneal membrane is clearly seen. The next step of the operation consists in the breaking down of adhesions, which may be done by the careful281 ON OVARIOTOMY. introduction of the finger between the cyst-walls and the parietal layer of peritoneum. And here some force is perfectly justifiable, for if the adhesions are confined to the abdominal parietes and can be torn through, there is rarely much subsequent danger to be apprehended. Extreme care, however, is required at this stage of the operation. The surgeon should, by the introduction of his finger, make out the extent of the adhesions and test their strength. If they should be found nume- rous and too firm for separation, the operation, at this stage, had better be abandoned and the wound closed; or, should many visceral adhe- sions of a firm character be present, it would be well to follow the same practice, as the latter are much more dangerous than those merely attached to the abdominal walls. It is, indeed, difficult, if not impos- sible, to describe with anything like accuracy what extent or character of adhesions would justify the surgeon in abandoning an operation once begun and then closing a wound. The careful study of reported cases and experience alone, will enable him to decide with certainty upon these points. Yet, as a broad rule it may be asserted, that while parietal adhesions may be fearlessly treated when they can be divided, those connecting the cyst with the viscera and the pelvis should always be regarded with alarm ; and that the amount of force permissible in the treatment of the former class of cases would be quite inexcusable when the viscera are concerned. Wells’s method of emptying the parent cyst, passing one hand into its interior, grasping its back and inverting it, the back part of the cyst being withdrawn through the opening made in its front, is an excellent one. The fear of haemorrhage from the lacerated adhesions should always be present to the surgeon, and the torn surface should be carefully examined with a view to the arrest of any bleeding. Omental adhesions should be particularly examined with care and torn through with caution, for they are very vascular and cannot be treated with too much consideration. As a rule, they should be divided and secured with a fine ligature of silk or carbolised catgut. Their for- cible separation is always bad.

The ends of each ligature may be cut oft’ and the knot left in. When the incision has been made, and no evidence that adhesions exist between the cyst and the internal abdominal walls, it appears to be an unnecessary practice for the operator to introduce his hand into the abdominal cavity with the view of learning whether they exist or not.

In com- plicated and exceptional examples of this operation it is clear, that this practice cannot be followed, but in the more ordinary and simple cases it is most applicable. In many examples which have come into my hands, the value of this advice has been well proved, for in them the peritoneum was touched only by the knife and needle. The treatment of the pedicle. If there be one thing more than another in the practice of ovario- tomy which presses for a solution, it is the treatment of the pedicle, for the practice of different surgeons on this point varies extremely, and the multiplicity of methods is most confusing. In France, Mai- sonneuve twisted off the cyst by continued torsion, leaving the pedicle to fall back into the abdomen; whilst Nelaton preferred to fix the pedicle externally, and secure it by means of a common clamp. In Germany, Martin and Langenbeck cut through the peritoneal covering of the pedicle by a circular incision, cut off the tumour, tied each vessel separately, and fixed the pedicle to the walls of the abdomen by means of a double ligature. Dr. C. Clay fastened the pedicle by a double ligature, cut off the tumour, and, having allowed the pedicle to drop backwards into the pelvis, brought the ends of his ligatures out through the lower ends of the incision. Dr. Tyler Smith advised the same treatment of the pedicle as Dr. Clay, but differed from him in the important respect of dropping both pedicle and ligatures, which are cut off close, into the pelvis; the wound should then be closed. Mr. S. Wells pre- fers to fix the pedicle externally by means of a clamp (Fig. 410), and Dr. T. Keith has adopted the same practice, although recent experi- Fig 410. Spencer Wells’ clamp. ence has satisfied him of the value of the actual cautery as employed by Mr. B. Brown and Skolberg, who divided it by the actual cautery, and allowed it to drop back into the pelvis. Atlee of America employs the ecraseur. In my own practice, I have not adopted one unifoim method, having been influenced in my decision by the special pecu- liarities of each case. If we refer to the results of the practice of different operators, who have been in the habit of adopting the various plans to which I haveON OVARIOTOMY. 2S3 alluded, it will be seen that good success has attended each. Upon the whole, the best results possibly have attended the practice of fixing the pedicle externally. The first object which the surgeon has in view in the treatment of the Objects in pedicle is, to prevent haemorrhage, and, in the attainment of this end tiie he should employ such means as are the least liable to excite or be pedicle, followed by, peritoneal inflammation. When experience lias decided upon a plan which will with certainty secure these two objects, the one great difficulty which attends the practice of ovariotomy will have been overcome, and the mortality of the operation, doubtless, be much diminished. In the infancy of ovariotomy the early operators treated the pedicle upon the simplest principles. They secured it by one or two ligatures and brought the ends of the ligatures out of the wound; but subsequent experience has taught us, that the fastening of the pedicle by one ligature is dangerous, and cannot be adopted with safety. It does not attain even the first object the surgeon ought to have in Use of the view, namely, security from haemorrhage; while the mortality of the single cases in which it has been employed has been very great. The practice lisature- of fastening the pedicle by a double ligature, and of bringing the ends xjse of the out of the wound, still exists, and in Dr. Clay’s hands has proved double successful. ligature. The fear of exciting peritonitis by the presence of such a foreign body as a double ligature hanging from the wound, and the natural dread that surgeons entertained of evil consequences from the decom- position of the extremity of the ligatured pedicle within the pelvis, rendered the minds of surgeons dissatisfied with the practice just described, and induced Mr. Duffin to urge the expediency of keeping the strangulated stump of the pedicle outside the wound. Mr. Keeping Hutchinson perfected the practice by the introduction of the clamp. 8^j"?P Up to a recent date, this practice was generally approved, and, as wound0 ° can be seen by the statistics of the different operators, it has hitherto borne good fruits; still, to the minds of reflective men, it was not so satisfactory as could be wished; the good which was evi- dently acquired by maintaining the secured pedicle external to the wound was neutralised in certain cases by an undoubted evil. When the pedicle was long and narrow, the method appeared to be Evil of good and successful; but when the pedicle was short or broad, many traction on bad effects became perceptible—evils which could only be attributed to Pecticle- the traction upon the uterus and its appendages from their pelvic posi- tion. It was thus, therefore, that other plans of treatment were looked for, by which this traction on the pedicle could be obviated, and yet security from hemorrhage guaranteed. The plan of treatment which naturally suggested itself was the drop- Dropping in ping in of the pedicle with the divided ligature, and this was first done of the pedicle, j in 1829 by David Rodgers of New York, who, in removing an ovarian tumour, applied a ligature to the pedicle, cut short both extremities of the ligatures, returned the pedicle into the abdomen, and closed the external wound. His patient made a good recovery. This plan of treatment did not meet with general approval. It was too bold and inconsistent with all past experience and professional prejudices, and fell to the ground. It was repeated at intervals by other surgeons with tolerable success, and has now gained a strong hold on the professional mind, and bids fair to become, in certain cases a284 ON OVARIOTOMY. Brotlie’s view. Use of eai-bolised catgut ligature. Division of pedicle by actual cautery. Conclusions . as to the 1 treatment of the pedicle. more general practice. I may mention here that Sir B. Brodie had some confidence in this practice, for in 1843, when discussing the case upon which Mr. Aston Key had operated without success, at Guy’s Hospital, he expressed his belief, that the right treatment of the pedicle was to drop it in and close the wound, and that if success could be secured, it would be by such means. I make this statement on the authority of Dr. Oldham, who heard the remark. In a fatal case recorded by Dr. Peaslee in the ‘ American Journal of Medical Science,’ July, 1865, in which this practice was adopted and death followed the operation on the seventeenth day, the extremity of the pedicle was found to be atrophied, but not sloughing, and the li- gature was covered with an exudation of lymph which had already become somewhat organized. In a case occurring in my own practice, the pedicle was secured with a carbolised catgut ligature which was cut short and dropped in, and, when the patient died a year subse- quently, from some other cause than the disease, no traces of the ligature were visible, nor even an adhesion, the fimbriated end of the divided pedicle being free. In our profession, however, a theory when once established rapidly developes, and a practice which is based on a received principle soon improves. The professional mind having realised the fact that the pedicle of an ovarian tumour might with safety be strangled by a ligature, dropped into the abdomen, and the wound closed; and, having been taught by the results of experience that the strangled extremity of the pedicle did neither decompose nor set up any peritoneal mischief, looked out for some other plan of treat- ment by which the presence of the foreign body, the ligature, might be done away with. As a result, the division of the pedicle by the ecraseur was tried, while that by the actual cautery has been in- troduced. The use of the cautery is a bold practice, and has the advantage of past experience in its favour, since from the earliest times the hot iron has been a favourite means of arresting haemorrhage, even from large vessels. In the veterinary art it is also still con- stantly employed. Mr. Baker Brown, to whom the credit of its application is unquestionably due, informs us that his experience of this form of practice is very good, and that of Skolberg of Stockholm is certainly startling. But haemorrhage at times follows the prac- tice and renders it uncertain. I have lost two patients from this cause. On the whole, the evidence seems to indicate that the practice is good in certain cases—that in short, fleshy, and broad pedicles, the cautery is efficient, but that in the long and thin it is unnecessary, other treatment being more applicable. More facts, however, are required before the cautery can be generally received into practice, although by means of the cautery, aided by the crushing of the extremity of the pedicle, safety may be found even in extreme cases. What, then, it may be asked, is the right treatment of the pedicle of an ovarian tumour ? Is it always to be secured by one method P and if not, under what circumstances is the plan to vary ? Going back to past experience we have ascertained that if the pedicle is to be tied, it should be in at least two places; and that all traction on the pedicle, and as a consequence on the uterus, is to be regarded with apprehension, and, therefore, to be avoided.ON OVARIOTOMY. 285 We have learnt that the pedicle may he ligatured in two or three Treatment of parts, dropped hack into the pelvis, and that the ends of the ligatures l)edlcle- may he left hanging from the wound with a good result; and that the pedicle may also he fastened externally by means of a clamp with equal success. But we have also ascertained that good success is gained by dropping the pedicle into the abdomen, after its division by the crushing clamp and cautery, or, after it has been ligatured in two or more portions and the ends of the ligature been cut off. It would appear, as far as present experience goes, that in the case of long pedicles, the best practice is to fix them externally by means of a clamp; with short and broad pedicles in which the vessels are usually small the cautery may be employed ; or, the pedicle ligatured in two or more parts with stout silk, the ends of the ligatures cut off, the stump dropped in, and the wound afterwards closed. If subsequent experience proves that the cautery is to he relied on, whether aided or not by other means, we shall doubtless have dis- covered a plan of treatment which bids fair to do more for ovariotomy than any other improvement of modern times. Hitherto it has been in the treatment of short and broad pedicles, the class of cases for which the actual cautery is now proposed, that ovariotomists have experienced so much difficulty; but at present the practice can hardly be said to have yet arrived at any state of certainty. In this treatment of adhesions, our practice should be governed by like principles. When they are slight, they may be broken down; when strong, they may be divided or ligatured, or perhaps destroyed by the cautery. When large vessels exist, they must he tied until the crushing and cauterising plan of treatment has been perfected. But let no risk be run, let the ligature be applied, and their ends cut off, rather than incur any chance of bleeding. On sponging out the pelvis.—The tumour having been removed Qu sponging and the pedicle secured, it will be well to examine the opposite out the ovary, to be sure of its healthiness, and then to turn attention to Pelvi8- the presence of the fluid or blood that may have escaped into the pelvis during the operation. If the fluid of the ovarian cyst has been of the serous kind, and the evidence of the extravasation of blood into the abdomen is purely negative, there will be little or no need of running the risk of irritating the peritoneum or pelvic organs by the application of a sponge; for the thin serous fluid of ovarian cysts is readily absorbed, and the presence of a little blood of small consequence, since we know from experience that blood may be exten- sively effused into a joint and no evil follow, as it may into the cellular tissue of a part and yet be absorbed. Obstetricians will also readily recall cases in which blood has been effused into the peritoneal cavity without, of necessity, any serious result. A sponge must not, therefore, be applied to the delicate surface of the peritoneum without good reason, and, where the fluid of the ovarian cyst has been simply serous, and no evidence of the effusion of blood in any quantity, there is no need to use a sponge. When required, it should be new, of the softest kind, and well warmed, two or more dips into the pelvis being carefully made, to free the cavity from all foreign matter. The sponge is far preferable to flannel, for, when properly cleansed and soft, it is quite unirritating, and* not so likely as flannel to leave any foreign matter behind. The sponge,ON OVARIOTOMY. 286 Caution. Treatment of the wound. Should the peritoneum be included f Drainage tubes. After- treatment. Morphia suppository. Diet. I Value of ice. Catbeterism. however, should always be carefully employed when there has been any escape of mucus or other thick ovarian fluid, and when much blood has been effused; indeed, in those cases, much care is required to cleanse the pelvis and abdominal cavity from all such irritating materials. The number of sponges and forceps employed should always be counted before and after the operations for obvious reasons. Treatment of the Wound.—The operation completed, the pelvis cleansed, the opposite ovary examined, and all signs of hemorrhage absent, the surgeon may then proceed to the closure of the wound. He should do this by means of deep and superficial sutures, and he may use silk or silver sutures according to fancy. In my early operations I preferred silver sutures which I have now discarded, as I do not find them less irritating than silk, and, in their removal, they are more liable to scratch and tear the tissues through which they are drawn than the fine white plait, sold by fishing-tackle makers, which I am now in the habit of employing. These sutures should be inserted at intervals of an inch, and include the muscles, and peritoneum; inter- mediate superficial sutures being inserted through the skin. When union has taken place, they should be removed, any time between three and six days being suitable. When repair has taken place, no object is gained by leaving them in situ ; they are then foreign bodies, and should be removed. Drainage tubes.—In all complicated cases where the peritoneum has been much involved and there is a probability of hsemorrliage or serous exudation, the introduction of a drainage tube at the lower angle of the wound should be followed. One made of glass is better than the india rubber. The after-treatment. Whenever a patient has taken chloroform or any anaesthetic mix- ture, it is wise to keep the stomach as quiet as possible, and as the benefit of an opiate after the operation is always great, it is wise to administer it by the rectum. In abdominal operations, this prac- tice is of great value, and, for some years, I have been accustomed to give a half grain of morphia suppository after every ovarian operation, as well as after others of hernia, ruptured perineeum, &c. Tiie suppository should be administered before the patient has recovered from the effects of the anaesthetic, and care should be taken that it be passed well into the rectum. If pain appear, the suppository may be repeated, but it is rarely necessary to administer it more than once a day, at bedtime. The patient’s room should be kept cool and airy, as in other cases of operation. For the first two days, milk or barley water form generally the chief diet; but should sickness super- vene as a result of chloroform, ice and milk, or ice and soda water should be administered; and everything should be cold. If it con- tinues, food ought to be given two or three times a day by the rectum. As soon as the stomach will admit, fresh meat, brandy, and wine ought carefully to be given, the object being in these cases, as in all others of general surgery, after the first three days, to keep up the powers of the patient, and so enable nature to complete the cure. The appli- cation of an ice bag to the abdomen I have found of great advantage, and an ice cap to the head when the temperature rises. The urine ought to be drawn off periodically by the catheter, and when the bowels require relief, their action should be rendered easy by the useON OVARIOTOMY. 287 of enemata. The bladder should never be allowed to become distended, nor the bowels be left loaded too long. On the use of opium a few remarks remain to be made, for upon this point the practice of surgeons appears to be undergoing a change. In the early operations of ovariotomy it was extensively employed, and at the present time, some are still free with its use, but there is good reason to believe, that in this operation as in others, a very free admin- istration of the drug in every case is not attended by such good re- sults as could be wished; and that in a patient under its full influence, a wound does not repair so rapidly and favourably as in another where natural processes are allowed to progress without interference. Opium carefully given to allay pain and cause sleep, is a drug upon the value of which there cannot be a doubt, but opium administered with sufficient freedom to bring, and repeated often enough to maintain, a patient under its influence, is a drug the use of which a surgeon should be on his guard. In ovarian cases it ought not to be given in larger quantities than sufficient to allay pain and secure sleep. A patient should not be kept under its full influence, unless there are specific reasons for it. It is best administered by the bowel, being less liable to cause injurious effects, and more likely to produce good, since it is absorbed as rapidly by the rectum as by the stomach, and in abdominal operations, it tends much to maintain that requisite quies- cence of intestinal actions which in all such cases is so desirable. In my own practice I have been accustomed for some years to administer opium by the bowel in preference to the stomach, in all cases of abdominal surgery. After the operation of ovariotomy, patients may become pregnant. Many of mine have done so, and in one case recorded in the * Gaz. Med. de Paris,’ 1873, a patient had twins, one male and the other female. Ovariotomy may even succeed when performed upon a pregnant woman. Mr. Spencer Wells has reported nine such operations with eight recoveries. In five of the nine cases pregnancy proceeded and living children were born after natural labour, and in all these, the operation was performed within the fourth month. In the other cases a miscarriage occurred. On the treatment of suppurating ovarian cysts. When an ovarian tumour is breaking down and undergoing disorgan- izing or suppurative changes, whether spontaneously or after tapping, it has been already stated that it is the surgeon’s duty to interfere, and to remove what is a serious source of constitutional irritation, and which, if left to itself, must to au almost certainty destroy life. This should be done by means of an exploratory operation. When the tumour can be removed as a whole, so much the better; but, when it has contracted such adhesions with the parts around as to be practically immovable, as much of the tumour should be turned out of the parent cyst as possible, and the cyst itself stitched to the margins of the wound, the suppu- rating cavity being well washed out once or twice daily, and a drainage tube left in. I have recorded an excellent example of this practice Tn ‘Guy’s Hosp. Rep.’for 1868, where a woman, set. 34, was successfully treated by these means; and more recently, in 1874, I removed a sup- purating ovarian cyst associated with acute peritonitis with a successful result. Opium. On suppurating ovarian cysts.288 ON OVARIOTOMY. ( Extirpation of the Uterus. Extirpation of the uterus. When necessary. Cases applicable. Successful operations. A grave operation. This operation, extirpation for fibro-eystic disease and fibrous tu- mours filling the abdominal cavity, is one that will probably become more frequent as time progresses; but, under any circumstances the operation ought not to be undertaken until the tumour has acquired such dimensions as to threaten life, or to render what remains of it miserable. These tumours have often been mistaken for ovarian and operated upon as such, the mistake in diagnosis having only been discovered during the operation. As a rule, they are slow in their growth, solid in their nature, and low down in their pelvic position. They usually also attack women at a later period of life than ovarian tumours. In 1873, I removed a fibrous tumour the size of a large cocoa nut from the right cornu of the uterus at the same time that I removed a large ovarian tumour from the left ovary. The lady was set. 51, and recovered. The fibro-cystic uterine tumours, however, often present all the external features of the more solid ovarian, and cannot be diagnosed, more particularly when a pelvic examination reveals but little. When the uterus can be made out to form part of the tumour, and to move with it; when the uterine sound can be passed freely into the cavity of the uterus, and be made to extend far beyond its normal distance; when at each monthly period the flow is profuse; when the tumour is fixed well in the pelvis and the abdominal veins, &c., are turgid from its mechanical pelvic pressure, something more than a sus- picion of its fibro-cystic nature may be formed j but when none of these symptoms are present, the diagnosis cannot be made with cer- tainty. The operation of extirpation of the uterus has been performed with success by Clay of Manchester, Storer of Boston, Koeberle of Strasburg, Keith of Edinburgh, Wells, Thornton, Davies Colley, and myself. My own case was in the person of Miss M—> set. 26. The tumour had been growing for three years, and for this she had been under the care of Dr. Oldham, who believed the case to be one of ovarian disease. He sent her to me for operation. On May 19th, 1871, I operated, and, finding the uterus and both ovaries diseased, I removed the whole, fixing its base with a large clamp. An uninter- rupted recovery took place. Full particulars will be found in the ‘ Trans, of Obstet. Soc.,5 1873. I have operated on three other cases but not successfully, one patient dying from haemorrhage caused by the rupture of a pelvic vein, and the others from the shock and peritonitis. In two, I removed the uterus and its tumours by means of the chain ecraseur made by Meyer, of Great Portland Street, and I believe this to be the best instrument for the purpose. The chain should be passed well round the base of the growth, and screwed up slowly. Mr. Spencer Wells prefers a stout pin about the size of a penholder, around which a figure of 8 ligature is passed, the two together acting as a clamp. This operation is the gravest that the surgeon can undertake, the shock to the system being far greater than in ovariotomy. A good account of the cases done, up to 1866, will be found in the ‘ American Journ. of Med. Science ’ for January, 1866.MUSCLES AND TENDONS. 289 AFFECTIONS OF THE THE SURGERY OF THE MUSCULAR AND OSSEOUS SYSTEMS. CHAPTER XXVIII. AFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. Contusions. Contusions of muscles, as of other parts, may occur, and when severe Contusions. : may be followed, not only by want of power, but by absolute wast- !ing. Thus, in 1863, I saw a man, set. 44, who, five months before, received a severe contusion of the left deltoid muscle from a fall upon a the shoulder, and, as a consequence, the muscle had completely atro- ; phied, although there was no loss of sensation over the muscle, and in all other respects, the limb was normal. When wasting takes place, the muscle should be stimulated by gal- i vanism before degeneration has proceeded too far.

I have also the notes of a case of complete laceration of the extensor triceps muscle of the thigh above the patella, in a railway inspector, who said that it gave way with a report on his attempting to start off suddenly for a run. In this case there was great effusion of blood into the part within a few hours, which had subsided after the application of ice, the separation of the muscle from the patella being very distinct. In drawing (fig. 411), rupture of the rectus femoris is illustrated, and was taken from a male patient, set. 42. Fig. 411. Bupture of rectus femoris just above patella in a man, at. 42. Minor degrees of laceration of muscles are of common occurrence, and often followed for many months by pain, stiffness, and want of power in the part, the pain disappearing for a time to reappear on any over-action of the weakened muscle. These pains are often called rheumatic. Mr. Poland records in his ‘ Fothergillian Prize Essay’ two cases of complete rupture of the rectus abdominis muscle in the hypogastric region, so that the finger could be laid in the dents between the re- tracted ends. Both occurred in the wards of Guy’s Hospital, and in men of advanced years suffering under organic disease, the one had an advanced stage of bladder and kidney mischief the sequelae of old stricture, the other was suffering from a relapse after continued fever. In both, the accident had been caused by a fall across the iron rods of the bedstead in a vain attempt to rise and walk, and both died a few days after the accident, when complete rupture of the rectus was found in the middle of the hypogastric region. Coagulated blood was present between the divided ends as if only just poured out. Ho signs of repair existed. must be relaxed in order that the divided ends may be made to ap- proximate as much as possible and be fixed at rest, so that repair may not be interrupted. When much effusion of blood or serum follows, ice may be applied in a bag; and, when absorption has somewhat advanced, a stimulating liniment hastens recovery and gives comfort. When these are not attended to, repair cannot go on; indeed, as a conse- quence of neglect, suppuration is by no means a rare result, as is seen in psoas abscess. When the laceration has been complete, permanent weakness will remain, and, when the abdominal muscles are at fault, some hernial protrusion of the abdominal contents will take place. InAFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. 291 a man who fell from a ship’s ladder upon a blunt-pointed iron bar, and had severe rupture of the abdominal muscles attached to the anterior half of the crest of the ilium, a large hernial protrusion existed, and I could press my fist into the opening through the muscles. In such cases some artificial support is permanently needed. Compound laceration of muscle. , When muscles are lacerated in connection with wounds of the soft parts covering them the injury is grave, and the primary danger of the case as well as the prognosis as to the future use of the part, turns upon the amount of laceration. In compound fractures, &c., this fact is well known. But, at times, muscles are torn out through skin wounds, or are rup- tured at the time of the accident, and may even hang out of the wound. When this is the case, the muscle, unless much crushed or injured, must not be cut away but replaced in position as well as possible, and to further this end, the wound in the soft parts may be enlarged. One of the worst cases of this kind I have ever seen I attended with Dr. Mason of the Barbican. It was that of a gentleman, set. 22, who, when sleep-walking, fell a height of forty feet out of a window on a glass skylight. Among other injuries he sustained a lacerated wound of his right thigh and complete division of the body of the inner hamstring muscles. When I saw him, a large mass of well-developed muscle protruded from the skin wound. I enlarged the opening in the integument and carefully replaced the muscle, keeping the limb on a splint. In five weeks he was convalescent. A year later, he had complete movement of his limb. Entire tendons are sometimes torn out of a limb, and in Guy’s Hospital Museum there is a preparation (1367), which includes the last joint of the middle finger with its tendon from the flexor profundus attached. It was torn by a thrashing machine, the accident being followed by tetanus, yet the patient recovered. In another preparation (111965) figured below (Fig. 412), there is a portion of thumb with the long flexor and extensor Compound laceration of muscle. Evulsion of muscles. Muscle to be replaced.

There is good reason to believe that muscles, like tendons, may be Dislocation dislocated, although from the way the former are protected by fascia of tendons, and the latter by fibrous sheaths and bony grooves, such accidents are rare. When they occur, they are the result of some sudden and unexpected strain, rick, or twist. In the upper extremity, the accident may occur to the biceps tendon and those about the wrist, and in the lower, to the peronei tendons and tendon of the posterior tibialis as well as to the conjoined tendon of the extensors of the leg attached to292 AFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. the patella and that of the sartorius muscle. It may, also, doubtless affect other tendons. Whenever it takes place, it can be recognised by the starting of the tendon from its anatomical position, as well as by the pain suffered on putting the muscle into action—the muscle necessarily acting at a disad- vantage. The tendon in most cases may he readily reduced, but the great- est difficulty will be experienced in keeping it in position ; indeed, it is a question whether the sheath of a tendon when fairly ruptured will ever unite or repair, yet the attempt should be made. In a case of dislocation Of peroneus of the peroneus longus tendon, the only treatment that gave perraa- lougus. nent relief was its division, and, what is more, the foot was not visibly weakened by the operation. In 1869, I had under my care, a woman, set. 29, with a well-marked example of dislocation of the peroneus longus tendon. Some ten days before I saw her, when walking, she felt a sudden pain behind the external malleolus, which led her to think she had been struck with a stone. She was at once disabled and expe- rienced severe pain in the part; and on rubbing her ankle at the time, she felt a cord in front of the hone, which slipped in on moving the foot. Since that time any movement of the ankle caused the same cord to appear. When I saw her, by giving the foot the slightest twist the ten- don of the peroneus longus muscle could be readily displaced from its groove behind the external malleolus and made to appear upon the hone, where it could he rolled under the finger. Its reduction was effected by abducting the foot, hut it was kept in its position with great diffi- culty. For this purpose the best means were a good pad of lint fixed over and behind the ankle by means of strapping. I saw her a month after the accident, when she could walk without pain or stiffness; the tendon seemed fixed in its place; but the bandage and pad were applied, and directions given to retain them for a month. I have likewise seen the tendon of the tibialis posticus displaced from behind the inner malleolus. Dislocations of muscles are probably more rare than those of tendons, and if not, are less recognised. They may be suspected to have taken place where after a rick or strain pain is produced when the muscle is put into action and the pain is fixed to a spot; when it is relieved by relaxing the affected muscles and kneading the part with the hand when so relaxed; and when, moreover, there is no external evidence of a bruise to suggest rupture of muscle. These cases should be treated by manipulation after relaxing the muscles, the surgeon with a strong and firm pressure manipulating the part at the seat of pain; subsequently pressure should be applied, and the muscle kept at rest for a sufficient time to allow the injured part to heal. Kupture of Tendons. Rapture of This is more common than rupture of the body of a muscle, tendons tendons. usually giving way at their muscular or bony origin. It occurs chiefly in subjects past middle life. The long biceps tendon not rarely gives at its upper end, and, when it does, it imparts to the biceps muscle on contraction, a peculiar appearance; its inner or cora- coid half contracting into a hard knot (Fig. 413), while its outer re- mains lax and but slightly altered. This swelling has been mistaken for tumour of the muscle of the arm. When the one tendon breaks, the other usually follows at a later date, thereby clearly indicating thatAFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. 293 Treatment. they give way from some disease which, affects their elasticity. In a. case I treated in 1858, the two tendons gave way at the interval of four months, and the arm became black and blue after the acci- dent. The tendo Achillis rarely snaps. The plantaris does occasionally, and when it does causes a peculiar dragging of the foot and eversion. In the case of a man, tet. 27, which I saw a few hours after the accident, this symptom was so marked and peculiar as to make it quite pathognomonic. The rupture was caused in taking an upward step of two and a half feet into a vessel with a load on his back. The tendon gave way with a snap when in the act of raising the posterior pait of the heel from the ground. Fio. 413 Ruptured long tendon of biceps. Drawing 37°°. I have likewise the notes of a case of rupture of the tendon of the biceps femoris which took place in a hoy, ait. 8, who, when hanging on behind a four-wheeled cab, had one of his legs entangled in the wheel. When admitted into Guy’s directly after the accident, the tendon of the biceps femoris was made out to have been ruptured at its insertion into the fibula; there was a marked depression at this point, with ecchy- mosis; the limb was flexed and fixed on an outside splint and a good recovery ensued, although there was some weakness of the muscles supplied by the external popliteal nerve, which had apparently been injured at the same time. Looking upon the ligamentum patellae as a tendon, the following example of its rupture may be recorded. In 1867 I was called upon to treat a man, set. 31, for an injury he had sustained to his right knee ten days previously, while attempting to save himself from falling backwards. The knee swelled after the accident and became acutely painful, and, when I saw him, the patella was drawn up for at least an inch, the ligament having been divided. I treated the case as for fractured patella with a posterior splint, and employed pressure to bring the patella downwards, but I was uu- able to alter its position to any extent. The man recovered, however, with a useful limb. Muscles and tendons may be cut like other parts, and then they separate directly. They should be treated like ruptured tendons or muscles by adopting such means as are necessary to bring the divided ends together and to keep them there, splints, bandages, and position being brought into requisition according to the wants of the individual Rupture of tendon of biceps femoris.

Tlie parts should he kept in apposition for at least a month or six weeks, otherwise some stretching of the uniting medium will take place, followed by permanent weakness or deformity. In certain cases of divided tendons, sutures may be introduced, and several cases are on record in which such treatment was successful. In wounds where muscles and tendons unite by granulation, some stiffness and want of power in the part will remain for a long time, or even continuously. But in healthy subjects it is remarkable, how ten- dons at one time fixed, subsequently free themselves from their sur- rounding attachments and become free again. This hope may always he held out to a patient who takes a gloomy view of his own prospects. Inflammation of muscle is a recognised affection, and occurs as a con- sequence of some strain or partial rupture of its fibres, as well as inde- pendently of any such cause. It is the more common as a result of injury, and is seen not seldom in the rectus abdominis as well as in the psoas muscle; indeed, as a cause of psoas abscess, I believe it to be more common than spinal disease. As a result of septicaemia, it is frequently met with; and is found in every muscle, even the heart. It appears as a more or less acute affection of the muscle, and is accom- panied by swelling, local pain and constitutional disturbance; suppu- ration occurs in due time. The symptoms rarely come on directly after the injury, but probably after the lapse of several weeks as a consequence of some want of repair in the injured part, and from the non-observance of the necessary rest which an injured muscle so much requires in the process of healing. When an abscess forms in a muscle the sooner it is opened the better, recovery readily follow- ing, even when the disease is in such a muscular organ as the tongue. Inflammation of muscle as an independent affection is generally chronic, and in adults is chiefly of syphilitic origin. In infants it is met with most commonly as an affection of the sterno-mastoid muscle; the body of the muscle wholly or in part appearing as an indurated mass. It is generally observed soon after birth, and may at times be traced to some injury sustained at that time. I have seen it in the offspring of syphilitic parents, but more frequently when no such history could be obtained. In fifteen consecutive cases, a syphilitic history was obtained only in one. These cases rarely if ever suppurate in infants, but, under the use of warm fomentations and some simple tonic, such as cod-liver oil, proceed to a natural recovery. I have never seen a case fail to recover by these means. In the early period of the disease, the inflammatory product is cellu- lar ; in the later fibrous. These points are seen in the drawings 414 and 414a, which have been kindly made for me by Dr. Goodhart. They were taken from a patient of Dr. F. Taylor’s, set. 5 weeks, who looked healthy, but bad had “ snuffles,” slight Assuring of the anus, and super- ficial ulceration of the scrotum. There was no history or other evidence of syphilis in the parents. The child died from atelectasis. The tumour in the left muscle was only noticed in the fifth week after birth, and the right muscle was never noticed to be diseased. The case is reported in the * Path. Soc. Trans.,’ 1875, vol. xxvi. The student should remember that this affection appears as a simpleAFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. 295 induration of the muscle, and is, affection.

Chronic inflammation of the sterno-mastoid is likewise met with in In adults adults, and, I believe chiefly as a consequence of syphilitic disease. It n,° attacks the muscles in the same way as it does others, such as those of s-'p 1 the tongue, the extensor triceps of the thigh and of the arm, the tem- poral, masseter, or other muscles, the muscle or muscles becoming infil- trated more or less diffusely with the well-known syphilitic inflammatory products. These tumours, when their nature is recognised and right treat- ment employed, can be re-absorbed; but if neglected and left alone, after attaining their full size, which is rarely great, break up and suppu- rate, giving rise to deep-seated abscesses, which, when they have discharged externally, leave deep, irregular, excavated sores. In the tongue these simulate closely cancerous sores; many of the cases of supposed cured cancer of the tongue being, doubtless, of this origin. In other parts, they have much the aspect of the deep cellular membranous ulcers which have been already described. As a part of syphilis, they always appear late in its course, and remote from the primary inoculation. When it appears in the adult, in the sterno-mastoid muscle, it more frequently attacks its sternal end than its body. After the disease has ceased, atrophy of the affected muscle is a Atrophy may common consequence. Contraction occasionally follows, though I have fo"ow- never seen it. MM. lticord and Notta have, however, recorded ex- amples. Recognising the syphilitic nature of this affection, the treatment should be conducted on the usual principles; large doses of the iodide of potassium, say fifteen to thirty grains, may be given three times a day with advantage; not in such full doses at first, but by gradual increase from one to five grains. Mercury may also be given, the mercupial suppository once or twice a day being the best form. In the chapter on syphilis this practice will be found described in detail.29G AFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. Atrophy of muscle. From infantile paralysis. Progressive muscular atrophy. Pathology. Symptoms. Atrophy of Muscle. The surgeon can see this under a great variety of circumstances. He is the most familiar with it as a consequence of want of use in disease of the joints, or any other affection in which the limb is kept at rest; and under these circumstances the muscles simply waste ; they undergo no other change in structure, and are capable of complete restoration on re-assuming their normal action. In a large number of cases of infantile paralysis, the same thing may also be said, for under the stimulus of galvanism or the continuous current, persevered in for many months, the thinnest limbs plump up, and the feeblest muscles become capable of performing the work for which they were intended. Indeed, in these cases where deformity does not complicate the case a good result may be looked for. After fevers, however, lead poisoning, rheumatism, scrivener’s palsy, and alcoholism, the muscles may undergo genuine degeneration, either granular, fatty, or waxy, and according to Lockhart Clarke “ there is another form of this malady, which is known by the name of progressive muscular atrophy (Cruveilhier), atrophie musculaire graisseuse pro- gressive (Duchenne), and wasting palsy. This curious disease differs in several respects from the other atrophies. It is always chronic, but of uncertain duration, is frequently hereditary, capricious or irregular in its invasion, prone to spread from one part to another, or become general, and thus go on to a fatal termination. The affected muscles suffer different degrees of wasting, and assume a variety of aspects. Even in the same muscle bundles in different stages of atrophy and degeneration may be found at the side of others that have retained their normal state. When the wasting is extreme in all the bundles, a long muscle may be reduced to a mere fibrous and cylindrical cord, or to a kind of tendon, and a flat muscle may be reduced in the same manner to a kind of membrane. In some instances the atrophy may be simple, that is, the muscular tissue may be wasted to a considerable degree without any granular or fatty degeneration; but generally one or both of these alterations of structure is found to exist to a greater or less extent. The muscle also changes and varies in colour, according to the nature and degree of the atrophy. It is paler than natural; occasionally it is quite colourless, like the flesh of fish, or it may have a faint yellow or ochreous tint. Its consistence for the most part is increased in consequence of the increase in the interfibrillar connective tissue. When examined under the microscope the affected muscles may be seen to have lost, to a variable extent and degree, or even entirely, the appearance of transverse and longitudinal striation, while in a corresponding proportion the sarcous or muscular element is trans- formed into granules, which in some instances are too fine to be dis- tinguished as separate particles. The granules are soluble in acetic acid. In this odd affection the granular, fatty, and waxy degenerations are found side by side ” (‘ Holmes’s Syst.,’ 2nd ed., vol. iii). This disease is said to appear more commonly in the hand and right upper extremity, progressing upwards to the trunk, and then over it to the lower extremities. It rarely commences in the lower limbs. It begins with loss of power in the part, but rarely with any loss of sensation, this symptom gradually increasing. Want of muscular co- ordination soon appears, as well as awkwardness in the patient’s move-AFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. 297 merits, cramps, twitches, and fibrillary tremors take place, occasionally with pain or some cutaneous anaisthesia. Cruveilhier believed that atrophy of the motor nerves was the starting-point of this disease; but this theory is not now entertained ; Lockhart Clarke says, “ in 1861 I discovered, in the spinal cord removed from a well-marked case of this disease, numerous lesions of the grey substance, consisting chiefly of areas of what I call granular and fluid disintegration; and 1 have seen the same in other cases since.” This view is taught by Trousseau, Duchenne, Meryon, Roberts, Cohn, and others. This disease is generally hereditary, more common in males than females, and is excited by excessive muscular exertion, cold, and damp, as well as by injuries or disease of the spine, syphilitic or otherwise. Treatment.—Removal of the cause is the primary object, and when Treatment, syphilis is suspected, special treatment should be employed. Tonics are always of use, and arsenic in Dr. Meryou’s hands has met with good success ; “ but of all remedies hitherto employed galvanism is undoubt- edly the most useful when applied to the affected muscleswhile Clarke states, that setous and blisters to the spine may be employed in the early stage. Degeneration of muscles with apparent hypertrophy, called Duchenne’s Muscular disease, after its first describer in 1858, is a strange affection which ^?eneratlon attacks children, but continues to affect them for many years of their hypertrophy, youth. I have placed it amongst the affections of the muscles, but the observations of Dr. L. Clarke (* Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. lvii, 1874) ‘ clearly places it amongst the neuroses. It begins with weakness of >i the lower limbs which is lasting, and passes on to a progressive en- i largement of the gastrocnemii, then of the glutei and lumbar muscles, and occasionally of all the muscles. These feel firm and elastic, and hard on contraction. After a variable period, at times years, the para- lysis gradually increases and becomes more general. “ The patient is no longer able to stand upright, the upper extremities become affected, the enlarged muscles rapidly decrease in volume, and the limbs and trunk become atrophied en masse. In this state the patient may exist for a considerable time, but ultimately dies from intercurrent disease. Many of the children affected with this singular disorder have dull intellects, and are more or less idiotic.” (Clarke.) Pathologically, great hypertrophy of the connective tissue of the muscles is to be found, the fibres themselves show finer striae and are transparent, large collections of fat-cells also exist. Neither medically nor surgically, does any treatment seem to be of benefit. Muscles at times ossify either in parts or in groups. In the College Ossification of Surgeons there is a specimen in which nearly all the muscles of the of muscles, back had become ossified, and at St. George’s Hospital, a similar pre- ' paration exists; the case being recorded by Caesar Hawkins (*Med. Gaz.,’ 1844). The disease is supposed to be inflammatory in its origin. i Some years ago, one of my colleagues at Guy’s excised a piece of bone from the body of the deltoid muscle, an inch long, the growth of seven - years. Tumours in Muscle. These are of rare occurrence, and always of a serious nature. They Tumours of are mostly of the fibrous or fibro-cartilaginous kind.

The tumour separated the fibres of the muscle which it infiltrated, and, microscopically, it had all the elements of the fibro-plastic tumours! It returned within the year, and when I last saw the patient, in 1869, there was a second growth the size of a cocoa-nut occupying the place of the original tumour. In 1868, with Dr. Burchell, of Kings- land, I removed from the abdominal muscles of a woman, set. 33, a myxomatous tumour, eight or nine inches in diameter, of two years’ growth. Cancerous tumours may originate in, hut more frequently infiltrate, muscles as secondary growths or by extension from other parts. Sur- geons see them in the pectoral muscles in acute or neglected cases of cancer of the breast; in the periosteal cancer of hone, as well as in other parts. In the tongue and lip they may be regarded as new growths. Hydatids, likewise, are found in muscles as in every other tissue, as painless, tense, globular, swellings. So also is that curious nematode worm the Trichina spiralis, which, in man, seems to he taken into the body through eating the insufficiently cooked flesh of animals infested with them, particularly that of pigs. “ Trichinae, as ordinarily observed in the human muscle, present the form of spirally coiled worms in the interior of small, globular, or lemon-shaped cysts, which latter appear as minute specks scarcely visible to the naked eye. These specks sometimes resemble little par- ticles of lime, and are more or less calcareous externally, according to the degree of degeneration which their walls have undergone ,• these cysts are not, however, essential.”—Cobbold. When these worms are present in large numbers in the body they give rise to a disease known as trichiniasis which is most fatal. Drs. Boehler and Konigsdoffer, of Central Saxony, who first saw this disease according to Leuchart who described it, state that “the affection began with a sense of prostration, attended with extreme painfulness of the limbs; and after these symptoms had lasted several days, an enormous swelling of the face very suddenly supervened. The pain occasioned by this swelling and the fever troubled the patients night and day. In serious cases the patients could not voluntarily extend their limbs, nor at any time could they do so without pain; they lay mostly with their arms and legs half bent—heavily, as it were, and almost motionless, like logs. Afterwards, in the more serious cases, during the second and third week an extremely painful and general swelling of the body took place,” a large proportion of the cases died. Dr. Thudichum has given an able report on this subject in the ‘ Medical Officer’s Report ’ to the Privy Council, 1864. Vascular tumours of muscle have been made the subject of a special paper by Mr. C. de Morgan (‘ Brit, and For. Med.-Chir. Rev.,’ 1864), and Mr. Teevan has published an able paper on tumours in muscle in the same Review for 1874. These, however, are very rare. The vascular tumours of erectile tissue attack a muscle either as a diffused or en* capsuled growth, or as tumours having the appearance of varicose veins around the muscle. They are chiefly though not always con- genital, and are generally found in the lower extremities. They have no definite clinical history beyond their gradual and painless increase. My colleague, Mr. Howse, in 1872, excised such a non-encapsuled growth from the biceps muscle of the thigh of a woman, tet. 23, which wasAFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. 299 made up of erectile tissue and highly vascular, and had been growing for eight years. He excised all the muscle that was involved, but left its tendon. A good recovery ensued, with free movement of the limb. Fig. 415. Tumours of Tendon. Besides ganglion, other tumours are found connected with tendon, Tumours of and of these, the cartilaginous and fibrous tendon, are the most common. Some are said to begin as ganglion and subsequently to consolidate. I have seen one com- posed of bone and cartilage of two years’ growth removed from the extensor tendon of the hand which was said to have such an origin. Tumours withtendonspassing through them are not rare, and on two occasions I have had to amputate the hand of a child for a cancerous tumour occupying its palm, through which all the flexor tendons passed (Fig. 415). In 1867 I removed from a hoy, ffit. 31, a congenital tumour the size of a walnut, which evidently grew from the theca of the tendon of the long extensor muscle of the thumb. The tendon passed through the tumour which surrounded it. Dr. Moxon examined the growth with myself, which was clearly composed of fat or con- densed fibro-cellular tissue. The majority of tumours connected with tendons, however, are of the nature of ganglion more or less indurated. What has been described as the rider's hone is probably at first an The rider’s inflammatory infiltration and subsequently an ossification of the tendon tone, of the pelvic origin of the adductor longus or magnus muscle. I had such a case under observation in the person of a medical friend, set. 44, Example, who while hunting in 1869, made a violent effort to grip his horse when about to make a long jump. The effort was not attended with any pain, hut was followed by much ecchymosis extending down to the knee, and loss of power in the muscles of the part. When these symp- toms had subsided, a dense induration was felt in the pubic origin of the right adductor longus muscle, which was painful on manipulation. As time passed, this induration not only lasted but became more dense, and when I first saw him about three months after the accident, it was clearly in the sheath of the adductor longus and moved with it. It grew somewhat during two years, and, when the tendon was rigid, it appeared as an outgrowth from the pubis corresponding to the origin of the adductor longus, of about two inches in length. When the muscle relaxed, it was clearly only in the tendon, aud had no bony origin. At the present time, this gentleman can take his exercise as usual. Theic is a distinct grating to be heard and felt on moving the tumour, which has not grown for the last three years. The history of the case is identical with that given by Birkett (‘ Guy’s Hosp. Rep.,’ 1868). Billroth has also described this affection. Cancerous tumour of the hand. Dorsal aspect.Inflammation of tendons. Treatment. Relieve tension. Necessity of early incision. 300 AFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. Virchow is said by Holmes to have recorded the fact, that a similar ossification of the muscles of the left arm of the Prussian soldier takes place, and is termed “ exercise bone.” Inflammation of Tendons. As an acute affection, this is most serious and gives rise to severe local and constitutional symptoms. It is met with as a consequence of a severe strain or laceration of tendon, or of some punctured or other wound Involving the sheath. It may begin in one toe or finger and spread upwards to the palm, and so on to other tendons and even up the forearm. The local symptoms are pain with the external evi- dences of inflammation, heat, redness, and swelling; the swelling being deep-seated while the pain soon extends up the arm beyond the seat of mischief. The constitutional symptoms are those of more or less severe pyrexia. If surgical interference is not brought to bear upon the case at an early period, suppuration must soon appear with the local symptoms of throbbing and aggravated local distress, and the constitutional symptoms of rigors, excitement, and depression; inflammation of the absorbents and their glands will probably complicate the case. Under still more neglect, sloughing of the affected tendons, and dif- fused inflammation with suppuration of all the parts involved in the disease will ensue. A finger, hand, or forearm, may be jeopardised or sacrificed, if the inflammation be very active or the treatment with which it is met insufficient. Absorbent inflammation and blood poisoning (septicemia) are common accompaniments of this affection. Treatment.—This affection is very amenable to surgical control, and a free incision into the swollen part is the best means of arresting its progress by relieving tension. The operation not only relieves pain, which is caused by the tension of the fibrous tissues from the effusion beneath, but arrests the progress of the affection, by preventing the inflammatory effusion burrowing up the theca of. the tendon. For these objects a clean cut down to the theca should be made as soon as hardness of the parts, with external evidence of inflammation, appears. If pus escape the practice must be good, but if serum only, the operation will tend to arrest the progress of the affection at its onset, prevent the formation of pus, and probably check the disease. The incision should be vertical over the middle line of the finger and the centre of the tendon; no vessel or nerve of importance being there in the way. When suppuration exists, the surgeon must follow up with his lancet every line of inflammation and suppuration, for in no tissue does more harm ensue from retained fluids than in the fibrous. In the very earliest stage of the inflammation warm fomentations and possibly leeching may be beneficial. Elevation of the limb undoubt- edly relieves pain, the hand being higher than the elbow, and the elbow than the shoulder. A saline purgative is often serviceable. But the sur- geon must not lose time by such temporising means ; for tension of the part means its death by strangulation, if not mechanically relieved, and medicines, have no material influence upon the affection. When suppura- tion appears, tonics and liberal diet are required, as well as stimulantsAFFECTIONS OF BURS^I MUCOSA, GANGLION, ETC. 301 carefully adjusted to tlie necessities of tlie case. Sedatives are always ■wanted in some one of their forms. Morphia acts the most rapidly in quarter- or half-grain doses given subcutaneously. Water dressing or poultices should be applied. In very severe cases when the powers of life are failing, amputation may be justifiable, more particularly when the prospects are small of giving a useful hand or arm. For the arrest Occlusion of diffused inflammation in the hand and arm the occlusion of the °rt"'^mt-or main artery of the limb has been suggested. Moore and Maunder arrest of have both adopted it in the upper extremity, with enough success, to inflammation, justify the practice. Bleeding is apt to take place at times during the progress of the sloughing of the tendon, and if recurrent, such a complication is likely to induce the surgeon to perform some ope- rative act "for its control upon the main vessel of the extremity. Before doing this, however, he should always remove any sloughing tendon, as-1 have known haemorrhage even of a severe kind to be kept up by the presence of a sloughing tendon in a part, and to have been arrested by its femoval. Chronic Inflammation of Tendons. The thecae of the tendons of the extensors of the thumb, of the Chronic tendo Achillis, and the long tendon of the biceps, as of other muscles, inflammation are liable to inflame,, and this action is attended by pain and weak- 0 en ons’ ness on moving the muscles, and at times by swelling. More frequently, however, the affection will show itself by a peculiar crackling sensa- i tion which may be felt on grasping the part when the muscles are in motion. This crepitation when it has followed an injury, has more than once been mistaken for that of fracture; yet it is distinct, and when once felt ought to be recognised. The affection is readily cured by rest of the affected muscles, through the application of splints and by counter-irritation by means of one or more blisters.

Indeed, most of the cases of diffused suppuration around the knee have their origin in “ bursitis.” When the inflammation is less acute and shows itself by serous effusion into the bursa, it may give rise to local pain on pressure and a peculiar crepitation, this crepitation often existing before any percep- tible enlargement of the bursa has taken place. In the more advanced stage, when the effusion has increased, an encysted fluctuating swelling will have formed, which may be tense or flaccid, the degree of tension of the bursa turning entirely upon the rapidity of the effusion. In more chronic examples, the bursa will appear harder, firmer, and less distinctly fluctuating, while in very neglected or chronic cases, it may have so consolidated as to appear as a solid tumour, although the tumour will contain on section some cavity in its centre, the mass appearing to be made up of con- centric lamina) of organized lymph (Fig. 416). In exceptional may have completely consolidated. These bursae, as a rule, contain simple serum, although at times serum is blood-stained, while mother cases, rice-like bodies (organ- ized fibrin) or pedunculated fringe-like out- growths like loose cartilages exist. When injured these bursae may become filled with blood—their contents being grumous or like coffee-grounds (haematocele). Bands of lymph cross the sac at times, but more frequently they line it in regular, onion- like layers. In neglected cases, this fibrin may die and slough away, the bursa being cast out as a whole as in an ordinary cellular membranous ulcer, and in the case from which Fig. 417 was taken. In syphilitic subjects, this result is not un- frequent. On the other hand, a bursa may increase by effusion, and by some external cause rupture subcutaneously or externally, and thereby undergo cases, however, the bursa Fig. 416.

When I saw him, the cellular tissue about the kneeAFFECTIONS OF BTJKSiE MUCOSiE, GANGLION, ETC. 303 was infiltrated with serum which was subsequently absorbed, and the bursa did not reappear. What has been described as taking place in the bursa over the Otherseats of patella may occur in other parts, and more particularly over the ole- ^ursa:. cranon process, where an enlargement of the bursa goes by the name of the “ miner’s elbow.” I have, however, seen them over the acromion process in men who carry timber; over the tendon of the extensor triceps muscle of the thigh in a woman who habitually started her sewing machine with the knee; over the tuberosity of the ischium in Spitalfield’s weavers (“ weaver’s bottom ”), and in Thames lightermen; over the dorsum of the foot in extreme cases of talipes equino-varus when the children walked upon the part; over the external malleolus in tailors; over the malleoli and also the instep from the pressure of a boot; over the great trochanter of the femur in a soldier from pressure caused by sleeping on a board; and last, but not least, over the hall of the great toe in cases of “ bunion,” and in the sole of the foot over the heads of the metatarsal hones in men who walk much with short shoes, or with some who have contraction of the extensor tendons of the toes. Bursae will, however, enlarge or form wherever there is pressure, the enlargement being in a measure compensatory to save deep tissues. Yet this rule, does not hold good always, for I have seen more than one'instance in which enlarged bursae existed over the knuckles of the first phalangeal joint of the bands without any such cause. Treatment.—In the early crepitating stage of effusion, the removal Treatment, of all pressure and the application of a blister are, probably, sufficient to effect a cure, and, in more advanced stages, the repeated appli- cation of blisters is often sufficient to excite absorption of the effused fluid and recovery. When these means fail and the walls of the bursa are thin, the cavity may be tapped and the parietes of the cyst firmly Tapping, pressed together by means of a pad and strapping. When the walls are indurated, this treatment is useless; but a cure may generally be effected by the introduction of a seton which should be kept in till suppuration is freely established. In more solid cysts, none of these l means are of use, and excision is the only sound practice, the surgeon Excision. making his incision over the outer border of the bursa in order that - the cicatrix may be out of harm’s way.

It may he distended with serous fluid or may contain loose bodies such as are found in other burs® or ganglia. They should be dealt with cautiously on account of the possibility of their communicating with the joint. Hence, blistering and absolute rest of the arm are the best means to employ, the burs® being opened only when obstinate, and when pouching exists in front of the deltoid tendon. Prom one of these burs® on two occasions, I have evacuated within three months, more than half a pint of bursal fluid, containing melon seed-like bodies, a recovery subsequently taking place. Such an operation should, however, be done only after grave consideration. Another extensive bursa, situated beneath the extensor muscles of the thigh, is not infrequently the seat of acute or subacute inflammation, and such cases have been mistaken for inflammation of the knee- joint. The diagnosis ought not, however, to be difficult, for in the bursal enlargement however great, the bulging of the cavity will seldom extend downwards beyond the upper border of tbe patella; and will not, as in joint disease, extend to either side of that bone or below it. Fluctuation, moreover, will only be felt above the joint and not obliquely through it. When the patient stands, the difference between the distension of the bursal and that of the synovial sac will be also at once manifested. With this enlargement,there maybe some stiffness of the joint, but there will be always mobility. This bursa at times becomes the seat of suppuration, when the necessity of a correct diagnosis is more important on account of treatment. In all cases it is necessary to maintain rest, and the absorption of the fluid should be promoted by blisters. In obstinate cases when the bursa is very tense, the cavity may be tapped, and, when it suppurates, freely opened, but neither of these operations should be undertaken without a strong necessity, for suppurative inflammation of the bursa may extend to the joint with a fatal result. I have, however, tapped such a bursa in a woman, ®t. 35, and drawn off eight ounces of a thick, grumous- looking, semi-purulent fluid with success; in a second case, a woman, ®t. 50, I made a free incision into the bursa, and evacuated many ounces of pus and blood, such as escapes from a h®matocele; a good recovery took place. The deep bursa between the ligamentum, patella and the bone is very liable to inflame and enlarge, which gives rise to pain that is often mistaken for joint disease. The pain however, is always local over the bursa and aggravated by the patient attempting to raise the extended le°\ It is very troublesome, and when established, can only be treated successfully by means of blisters and rest with the leg on a splint. The bursa situated over the upper part of the tuberosity of the os calcis, between the bone and the tendo Achillis, is sometimes inflamed, and gives rise to a marked projection in the part; it causes pain and lameness. It is to be cured by absolute rest (the foot and leg being fixed on a splint) and the application of blisters. A. bursa also naturally exists in connection with and beneath the tendon of the psoas muscle as it passes over the arch of the pelvis ; thisAFFECTIONS OF BURSAE MUCOSA, GANGLION, ETC. 305 also mny communicate with the hip-joint. When distended with fluid it will give rise to a swelling in the upper part of the thigh on the inner side of the femoral vessels, which will he soft and fluctuating, hut not receive any impulse on coughing, like a psoas abscess, for which it is apt to be mistaken. The bursa between the tendon of the gluteus maximus and trochanter Bursa may also inflame and suppurate, and, when it does, it gives rise to a troublesome and often dangerous affection. When suppuration takes maximus place, an opening may be made, which should be free, but the thigh and must be well fixed. When suppuration does not occur naturally the trochanter, surgeon should be in no hurry to open the bursa, but be satisfied to keep the limb at rest and blister the swelling. Synovial bursae in the popliteal space require a rather longer notice In popliteal than the forms to which attention has already been directed, since they 8Pac<J- are, although common, sometimes difficult to diagnose and dangerous to treat. Their treatment, however, as a rule, is successful. These bursas may be divided in a clinical point of view into two classes—the first, including such as are connected with the sheaths of tendons or that encircle their insertion, and have no communication with the knee-joint; the second, those that directly or indirectly communicate with the joint and are either synovial herniae pouching from it, or‘bursae originating about the tendons and communicating with it. A mong the first is the normal bursa which exists above the head That do not of the fibula on the outer border of the popliteal space between the insertion of the biceps muscle and the external lateral ligament; a J0 ' second, which may be said to be on the outer border, although it has a somewhat more central position which separates the external lateral ligament from the tendon of the popliteus muscle; and a third on the inner side of the space which lies between the tendon of the semi- membranosus muscle and the inner tuberosity of the tibia—the whole of these bursae occupying the lower half of the popliteal space. In the second division, there is the smaller bursa which separates the Tlmt do. outer head of the gastrocnemius muscle from the outer condyle of the femur, and the larger that normally exists between the internal condyle of the femur and the inner head of the gastrocnemius and semi-membranosus muscles, and which generally sends a process between these muscles, the smaller occasionally and the larger generally com- municating with the knee-joint, both of these occupying the upper half of the popliteal space. The larger bursa may have its origin on the inner side of the popli- teal space, but as it grows, invariably encroaches on it and becomes central, and is far more frequently enlarged than any of the other popliteal bursa}. All these normal synovial bursae may become enlarged under the jinfiuence of over or prolonged exertion or any sudden strain, the .smaller ones increasing to the size of a walnut, and the larger to that |of an orange. As they increase so they become ceutral, and as they ;assume a central position difficulties in their diagnosis may be expe- rienced. They may contain a thin, clear, or blood-stained serous fluid; a tenacious, synovial, or colloidal, apple-jelly-like material, and, in ■xceptional instances may have consolidated. I have, however, known ;his to occur but once. It is probable that the bursae which have serous vol. II. 20306 AFFECTIONS OF BUKSA? MUCOSA?, GANGLION, ETC. When pulsating. When com- municating with joint. Treatment. Bursa in popliteal space. contents do not communicate with a joint, while those that have synovia do. Diagnosis.—In a general way there ought not to he any difficulty in making these cases out, more particularly when the different positions in which they may appear are known, since their circumscribed and defined outline, their fluctuating feel and mobility when the leg is flexed, and their hardness and elasticity when fully stretched fairly characterise them. When, however, the swelling pulsates and a bruit is heard over the tumour, some difficulty in diagnosis may be felt, although I can hardly understand how such a case could be mistaken for an aneurism, as on a careful examination the bursal pulsatile swelling could not be emptied and refilled by pres- sure upon the afferent artery, as would an aneurism; neither would the pulsation be so distinct nor the bruit so clear; for both the pulsa- tion and the limb would have been simply communicated. The posi- tion of the bruit, moreover, would have a greater influence upon the symptoms in a case of bursa than in that of aneurism; for whereas in the latter, by slightly flexing the leg upon the thigh, the aneurism would become more defined, its pulsations more marked and under control, in bursae the swelling would become more flaccid and less distinct. Extension makes the pulsation and the swelling to be more distinct in the case of bursae, and less so in that of aneurism. With respect to the diagnosis of a synovial bursa which communi- cates with the knee and a true synovial hernia, I have not much to add beyond the fact, that in the former there may be no symptoms of knee- joint disease, whereas in the latter, there will to a certainty be chronic effusion into the joint, which probably will be part of an osteo-arthritic change. When pressure upon the popliteal swelling causes it to diminish or disappear, while the joint itself enlarges and becomes fluctuant, or more so under the pressure, it is a fair inference that the joint and bursa communicate, although when these conditions do not exist, it would be wrong to infer the opposite, for the opening from a bursa is at times valvular and altered by position. Tbeatment.—As an enlargement of these burs® always follows excessive muscular action and strains, so by absolute rest of the limb as guaranteed by a splint and the application of repeated blisters, can the bulk of them be made to disappear. In obstinate examples of the first division of cases tapping may be resorted to, whereas in the second it should be undertaken only where other treatment has failed, and then with extreme care by means of the aspirator. In still more obstinate cases where the limb is rendered useless, a free incision may be made into the cysts, or they may be excised; but such desperate measures are only applicable in desperate cases. The first division of cases may always be boldly dealt with, but the second should be treated with extreme caution. Thus, in a case which was under my care some years ago, where by repeated blistering the tumour disappeared for a time only to recur, afsurgeon was induced to tap and subsequently incise the cyst, after which, acute suppuration of the part occurred, which in the end com- pelled amputation. The case of solid bursa already alluded to occurred in my own practice. I mistook it for a tumour, having punctured it with a needle withoutAFFECTIONS OF BURSjE MUCOSiE, GANGLION, ETC. 307 obtaining any flow of fluid. It was in a man of middle age, had been Bursa growing for about ten years, was tbe size of a fist, filled the popliteal space, and was solid and moveable. I found that it was connected with the inner hamstring tendon only on making the attempt to remove it. On recognising its nature, I took away a large portion of the mass down to its central cavity, which was the size of a nut, but I left the deeper part. Suppuration, however, subsequently attacked the knee-joint, and amputation became necessary. I am unable to point out how a correct diagnosis could be made in such a case as this, but the record of the fact that a solid bursa may exist in this locality, as well as the unfortunate result which accrued upon operation in my case may be of value. Holmes draws attention to a valuable paper by M. Poucher on this subject in the ‘ Archives Generates de Med./ 1856. Synovial Cysts. In connection with this subject of synovial hernia it should be Synovial stated, that at times these hernia} rupture and the synovial fluid c-s,s' escapes into the connective tissue of the leg, forming a synovial cyst; and, if Mr. Wormald was right when he taught that the thinnest point of the joint capsule was at the spot at which it partially encircles the tendon of the popliteus muscle, it is more than probable that it is at this spot that the fluid escapes. The synovial cyst may occupy the popliteal space and upper part of the calf of the leg, or may be evident in the calf of the leg only, pro- jecting most, as a rule, on the inner aspect of the leg, or may be per- ceptible only at the upper and inner part of the leg as a small defined swelling not approaching within three or four inches of any part of the knee-joint. There need not of necessity be any communicable fluctuation between the cyst and the joint. These cysts are generally found in joints that are the seats of osteo- arthritis and are curable. They should not be punctured or otherwise subjected to operation unless there appear strong reasons for so doing, inasmuch as interference may lead to acute inflammation and suppura- tion of the knee-joint. For this information I have to thank Mr. Morrant Baker, who has written a valuable paper on the subject in the * St. Bartholomew’s Hosp. Hep./ 1877. It recalled to my recollection several cases which were doubtless of this affection, and which I did not under- stand. Ganglion. This is met with in two forms, the one the more common as an Ganglion, encysted swelling connected with the sheath of a tendon; the second as a more diffused swelliug involving the theca of one or of many ten- TV dons, those of the wrist being the most commonly affected; and the Dlffu5ed> flexors more frequently than the extensors. I have, however, seen it in the extensors of the toes, and on the dorsal aspect of the foot beneath the annular ligament of the ankle; but it may attack any tendon. Ganglion is always the result of strain or over-action of the tendons. The local ganglion always contains colloidal apple-jelly-like material, which is at times crystal-like in clearness, at others pinkish. In the diffused, the fluid is more like synovia, containing loose bodies. “ The bursas or ganglions which form about the sheaths of the ten-Local. Symptoms o the diffused form. Melon-seed bodies. 308 AFFECTIONS OF BTTKSiE MTJCOSAD, GANGLION, ETC. dons at the wrist appear to be the cystic transformations of the celb enclosed in the fringe-like processes of the synovial membrane of the sheaths . . . Sometimes they are distended with serous fluid; at other times their contents possess a gelatinous or even a honey-like consis- tency, which constitute a form of meliceris. Under some circumstances free fibro-cartilaginous-like bodies, irregularly shaped, composed of a compact connective substance, form in considerable numbers, more especially in the ganglionic enlargement of the synovial bursa which surrounds the flexor tendons of the fingers at the wrist.”—Paget, Surg. Path.’ The localised form of ganglion is more common on the dorsal aspect of the wrist than anywhere else, although not rarely it is connected with the flexor tendons; and appears as a globular or irregularly cystic, tense swelling of the part. At times, it is very hard, at others, fluctuat- ing and soft. When of good size, it may be translucent. Pressure upon it to any extent causes pain, severe pressure sickening pain, even faint- ing and vomiting. Those in the palm of the hand about the head of the metacarpal bones are the most painful. At times, ganglion is painless, causing only some weakness of the wrist. A large ganglion occasionally forms behind the external malleolus connected with the peronei tendons. It should be touched with care. The diffused or compound ganglion varies in its symptoms according to the number of tendons involved. When one only is affected it may appear as a deep-seated, fluctuating, irregular swelling in the course of the tendon, the amount of swelling and deformity depending entirely upon its size. The swelling, when many tendons are involved, will be diffused; but when the whole of the flexor tendons are implicated it will occupy both the palm of the hand and the forearm above the wrist. In the case illustrated in Fig. 418, taken from a woman, set. 49, sent to me by Dr. Lovegrove, now of Hythe, all the flexor tendons Fig. 418. Ganglion involving all the flexor tendons of hand and wrist. were involved to an extreme degree. In such cases as these, the foreign bodies, commonly called “ melon-seed or rice-like” bodies, are usually present. They may frequently be made out to exist by the surgeon when ascertaining the presence of fluctuation from above and below the annular ligament of the wrist by firm pressure alternately applied in this direction, the pressure exciting a peculiar rough scrooping sensa- tion, caused by these loose bodies passing along the theoe of the tendons beneath the ligament.AFFECTIONS OF BURS^I MUCOSAS, GANGLION, ETC. 309 Treatment.—The local ganglion when first formed, may often be Treatment cured by the application of a blister and by rest of the tendon secured Blisters, by means of some splint, but when it has existed for some time, such treatment is useless. When it can be ruptured by pressure applied by Rupture, grasping the flexed hand with both hands and by one thumb superposed upon the other over the ganglion, a cure may often be effected; firm pressure being subsequently kept up by means of a pad of lint and strapping. When this fails, the ganglion should be punctured Puncture, subcutaneously by means of a spear-shaped needle or fine tenotomy knife, its contents squeezed out, and pressure applied by lint and strapping as before. When success does not follow this treatment, a silk seton may be introduced, the hand being kept quiet on a splint, seton. but it should be removed so soon as suppuration has been estab- lished. This treatment should not be employed, however, until all minor means have failed, for it is occasionally followed by diffused in- flammation of the theca of the tendon with all its dangers. The diffused or compound ganglion is dangerous to deal with; that oftlie is, any interference with it may be followed by severe inflammation diffused of all the thecae involved, and thus limb and life be jeopardised. But form‘ this result is not common when proper precautions are taken to guard against it. The risk of such a thing should always, however, be laid before the patient by the surgeon before any operation is ar- ranged. The only effectual way of dealing with it is hy incision. To do incision, this, the surgeon should for some five or six days before fix the hand and forearm upon a splint; he should then make a clean cut into the affected theca, free enough to allow of the ready escape of all the gan- glion contents without any forcible manipulation. When many tliecro are involved, more than one incision is called for. The incision should always be made in a vertical directions over the tendons, and both above and below the annular ligament when the disease extends up the arm. After the operation, the wound should be dressed with water dressing and the splint kept on, movement of the finger being allowed after the lapse of a few days, when the fear of diffused suppurative inflammation has passed away. In the severe example of the affection illustrated in Fig. 418, this practice was adopted with success, and in several others of a less severe character, I could record the same result. I have never had occasion to divide the annular ligament.310 MALFORMATIONS. Their varieties. Excess of development. CHAPTER XXIX. DEFORMITIES, CLUB-FOOT, AND ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY. Malformations. Malformations of the limbs remain to be considered, those of special parts having already received attention under other headings. Fig. 419. Types of the different kinds of deformities of the hands and feet. They may roughly be classed as being due either to excess or hyper- trophy, or to deficiency. Unnatural adhesion between parts is not rare, and mal-development in some odd way is occasionally met with. As examples of excess of development, supernumerary fingers or toes are the most common, the supernumerary digits being more or less well formed or rudimentary; appearing either as skin appendages (8, 9, Fig. 419) or being more like cleft phalanges, with common raetarcarpal or metatarsal bones (2,6, 7, Fig. 419). The thumb is very commonly cleft. Thus, out of twenty cases of supernumerary fingers and toes consecu-311 DEFORMITIES. tively noted, eigbt were of the thumb, and four of the fingers aloue, three of the toes alone, and five of the fingers and toes together, the deformity being symmetrical in six of the cases. Occasionally super- numerary fingers or toes have perfect metatarsal or metacarpal bones, and more rarely the hand may he double. Jardine Murray, of Brighton, has recorded such a case (‘Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xlvi). Hypertrophy of extremities is met with, either of whole limbs or parts of limbs. In drawing 10, Fig. 419, hypertrophy of one finger is shown, associated with deficiency of others, but the hypertrophy is a type of the affection that is met with in practice, whether of a digit or extremity. Treatment.—Rudimentary fingers and toes may he fearlessly ex- Treatment, cised when they appear as skin appendages, but, when they exist as bifid phalanges, great care is called for in their treatment on account of the frequency of there being a common joint to the two digits. Under these circumstances, the surgeon should carefully consider the question of amputation; and if he decide upon performing it, it will be wise to cut off the supernumerary digit some little distance from the joint, leaving a stump, which, as a rule, subsequently withers. Hypertrophied extremities may be removed when they are sources of great inconvenience, but not otherwise. Webbed fingers and toes are another common deformity. At times Webbed all the digits of one or both hands or feet are webbed, but more com- digits, monly only two are involved. Thus, I have seen the thumb and in- dex-finger webbed in one case (No. 3, Fig. 419); the ring and middle fingers of both hands (No. 4), and in another the second and third toes of both feet. In one instance, the toes of one foot were webbed, and the fingers of the hands more or less truncated. In another, with webbed toes on both feet, there was a supernumerary right thumb. Indeed, where a disposition to deformities shows itself several varieties of deformity may co-exist in the same subject. Treatment.—For the baud, when the fingers are well formed, the Treatment, surgeon, if possible, should divide the weh, but, under other circum- stances, it is more prudent to leave it alone. When the web is very narrow there is nothing left but to divide it, hut before doing so a good opening at the base of the cleft ought to he established to prevent the subsequent closure of the wound. This can be effi- ciently effected by means of the galvanic cautery or otherwise, and the subsequent introduction into the opening of a piece of aluminium wire, the wire being kept in till the wound has cicatrised and become as thoroughly established as an ear-ring hole. When this step of the operation has been effected, the cleft may be fearlessly divided. When the web is broader and more material exists for the surgeon’s manipulation, the best plan to adopt is, to split the weh transversely between the fingers, and to turn one flap of skin round one finger and the other flap round the second, stitching the edges of the flap to the skin of the finger. Webbed toes need no surgical interference. Absence of parts cannot surgically be remedied. In No. 13, Fig. 419, Deficiency or there was an absence of a thumb, but by way of compensation, an extra parts, finger was given. In No. 14, the ring-finger was absent, but the index and middle were hypertrophied. At other times, limbs are truncated as if from intra uterine amputation,312 DEFORMITIES. and, in rarer cases, bones and joints seem to be deficient. Thus, in a male subject I had under care some years ago the right arm was shortened as if amputated above the elbow, and the right lower ex- tremity was represented by one short bone, with a foot that would have been called perfect if the little toe had not been absent. These cases are mentioned, however, only as curiosities, and are beyond the pale of the surgeon’s art. M,d- Clawlike extremities as represented in Nos. 1, 11, and 12, Fig. 419, development. are very curious. No. 1 represents the hands of George N—, set. 7 weeks, the third child of well-made parents, the other children being natural. Very little power existed in the claws, one finger alone being of use. The child in other respects was well made and intelligent. Nos. 11 and 12 were taken from Edward E—, sat. 4, one of eight children, three being boys and five girls, one brother having precisely the same deformity. The parents were well made. The hands in No. 11, had apparently but three metacarpal bones; the wrist and carpal joints being normal; the solitary digit had much power. The feet in No. 12, were still more oddly made. In both, the tarsal bones seemed to be natural, but on the right foot the metatarsal bones were confused together. The digits had good power. Nothing could be suggested for the patient’s benefit. Hereditary nature of deformities. Heredity. The hereditary nature of deformities is generally recognised, though in the history of such cases it is exceptional for such a tendency to be traced. When, however, it is made out it is, as a rule, remarkable. De- formities when inherited, are also generally of a like kind. Thus, de- Generally of formities of the genital organs are passed on to succeeding generations, like kind. ag ;g tjje deposition to harelip or webbed fingers, &c. Exceptions to Exceptions to this rule are met with. Thus, in a family of twelve children, two out of four boys had harelip and fissured palate, and one out of eight girls had hypertrophy of the right lower extremity, with atrophy of the right great toe. The father of this family had a supernumerary little finger on one hand. A female child, one of five, the other four being well made, had hy- pertrophy of the two inner toes of the left foot. They were at five weeks old as large as the toes of an adult, and as well made. The parents had no deformity, but the father’s maternal grandfather had a double thumb. A boy had a double thumb on one hand and a web between the second and third toes of both feet. His father had webbed toes. These exceptions to the rule above given are, however, rare. Examples of As illustrations of the rule, the following cases have been extracted law. from my note-books. A man had six perfect toes on each foot, and six perfect fingers on each hand. He was one of ten children, all of whom had the same kind of deformity. The parents of these children were, however, well made. A female child had left equino-varus. She was one of eight children, the other seven being well made. The parents had no such deformity, but the mother had two brothers and one sister so deformed, and her father had double talipes. A man had scrotal hypospadiasis, and was one of nine children. Both his parents were well formed,and no history of deformity could be traced313 CLUB-FOOT. backwards. One of his sisters had harelip, while two of his brothers were deformed as he was, one having passed as a female till he was eighteen years of age.

When a muscle or a group of muscles, from whatever cause acts spasmodically with an active tonic contraction, or a slow and progressive Spasmodic one quite irrespective of the will, or but slightly influenced by it, and distortions, in this way overcomes the opposing muscle or group of muscles, defor- mities may likewise he produced, such cases being called spastic or spasmodic distortions. In the first class, the degree of deformity depends much upon the degree of paralysis that is present, and in the second, on the amount of spasm or contracting force of the muscles involved. Some surgeons would class all deformities in the first group, hut this view is incorrect. Both may he congenital or acquired. In the congenital, greater How changes take place in the conformation of the hones than in the produced, acquired, these changes depending much upon the intensity of the muscular action, but more upon the period of life at which they com- menced. “ It seems as if in congenital club-foot and analogous distortions a Little’s stimulus or irritant were present in the medulla spinalis, acting upon Vlews- certain ganglionic cells there, which keeps the affected muscle in a state of tonic contraction, yet not sufficient to neutralise the stimulus of the will within the limits of movement permitted by the structural shortening of the member. Many non-congenital spastic contractions appear allied to the condition which prevails in some states of chorea, in which, when the will would permit or cause contraction or relaxa- tion of a particular muscle, an involuntary influence excites contrac- tion, interferes with and frustrates the voluntary effort. In more intense spasmodic contractions the will is entirely overpowered before structural shortening supervenes to effect the same end.”— Little. As an extra argument in favour of this view, the fact may be adduced that club-foot often co-exists with other deformities, such as spina bifida and club-hand, &c. “ Congenital and non-congenital club-foot spring from analogous causes.” When these muscular contractions are powerful enough or continue long enough to alter the natural position of a part, deformity is said to exist, and according to its seat or form has it a special name. To Stromeyer abroad as well as to Little in this country, are we chiefly indebted for most of our knowledge on this matter, although in more recent times Tamplin, Lonsdale, W. Adams, Brodhurst, and others have added much to the subject.314 CLUB-FOOT. Club-foot. Its forms. Combina- tions. Stromeyer, however, in 1831, only followed Delpech in 1828, this great surgeon, following a greater—John Hunter—who in 1794 esta- blished the principle of subcutaneous surgery, when he divided injuries to sound parts into two divisions, and established this principle, that—“ The injuries of the first division, in which the parts do not com- municate externally, seldom inflame, while those of the second com- monly both inflame and suppurate.” Club-foot may he divided into four typical forms :— Talipes equinus, in which the heel is simply drawn up by the con- traction of the muscles of the calf (Fig. 420). Fig. 420. Talipes varus, in which the foot is drawn inwards to different de- grees (Fig. 421). Talipes valgus, in which the foot is turned out (Fig. 422). And, talipes calcaneus, in which the foot is drawn up and the heel depressed (Fig. 423). Combinations of these forms are commonly seen, thus, we have T. equino-varus, when the foot is turned in and heel drawn up (Fig. 421a) ; T. equino-valgus, when the foot is turned out and the heel drawn up; T. caleaneo-varus and calcaneo valgus being terms applied when the heel is depressed and foot turned in or out. Talipes varus is the usual congenital form, but any may exist, talipes Fig. 421. Congenital Varus. equinus and equino-varus and valgus being the more common acquired forms.ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY. 315 lu. valgus, the peronei muscles are chiefly involved; in varus, the ad- ductors, particularly the twotibials; in equinus, there is contraction of the muscles of the calf through the tendo Achillis; and in calcaneus, paralysis of the same group. Club-foot is often hereditary, and more prone to attack the male Often branches of a family than the female, and in this respect seems to follow hereditary, the ordinary law of all deformities. In a case under my care of talipes varus, the child’s father, grandfather, and great grandfather on the father’s side had congenital talipes, while none of the female branches of the respective families were deformed. “ It is convenient, for practical purposes, to divide congenital club- Degrees of foot into three degrees of severity: the slightest, that in which the severity, position of the front of the foot, when inverted, is such that the angle formed by it with the inside of the leg is greater than a right angle, and in which the contraction is so moderate that the toes can easily be brought temporarily by the hand of the surgeon into a straight line with the leg, and the heel be depressed to a natural position. The second class includes those in which the inversion of the foot and elevation of the heel appear the same or little greater than in those of the first class, but in which no reasonable effort of the surgeon’s hand will temporarily extinguish the contraction and deformity. The third class comprises those in which the contraction of the soft parts and displacement of hard parts reaches the highest degree, so that the inner margin of the foot is situated at an acute angle with the inside of the leg, sometimes, or even almost in contact with it. Cases of the first and second grades may be respectively converted into the second and third grades by delay in the application of remedies, and by the effects of improper locomotion.”—Little. Talipes equinus is the most common form of the acquired talipes, al- t. equinus though Little positively declares it is at times congenital. It is found the more in every degree, from the inability to flex the foot beyond a right angle to a pointing of the toes, necessitating the patient walking upon the form"U heads of the metatarsal bones and phalanges, the head of the astragalus projecting prominently on the dorsum of the foot. Fig. 420 illustrates the medium and extreme forms. Talipes varus is the more common congenital form.

Pig. 421a. based, and the process by which repair can take place after the di- vision of tendon. To Paget and W. Adams, in this country, we are chiefly indebted for our knowledge of this subject, and I shall use as much as pos- sible, Adams’ description of this process as published in 1860, in his work on the ‘ Repara- tive Process of Human Tendons after Division,’ his investigations having confirmed those of the former as well as added to our stock of knowledge. When such a tendon as the tendo Achillis is divided subcutaneously, the divided ends sepa- rate, in an infant for half an inch, and in an adult from one to two inches, the degree depending much upon the healthy condition of the divided muscle and the amount of move- ment subsequently permitted in the ankle-joint. The reparative process begins by increased vascularity in the sheath of the tendon, which is followed by the infiltration of a blastematous material into its meshes or spaces between its fibrous elements, exhibiting the development of innumerable small Fig. 422. nuclei, a few cells of large size and irregular form, with granular contents,or, perhaps, with Fig. 423. one or more nuclei and studded with minute molecules of oil; a blaste- matous material, in which the cell forms do not develope beyond the stage of nuclei, appearing to be the proper reparative material from which new ConcfenilaZ tendon is developed. This Acquired Talipes Calcaneus nucleated blastema soon becomes vascular, capil- lary vessels having been seen in it on the eighteenth day; the nuclei assume an elongated, spindle, or oat-shaped form, and are seen afterORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY. 317 the addition of acetic acid to be arranged in parallel linear series. The tissue becomes gradually more fibrillated, and at last fibrous—a solid bond of union subsequently forming between the divided extremi- ties of the tendon, which is tough to the touch, but to the eye presents, even for at least three years, a greyish, translucent appearance, distinguishing it at once from the glistening old tendon. This newr tissue remains during life as permanent, and has little tendency to contract subsequently. Adams’s observations rather led him to the conclusion, that the required portion of new tendon is to be obtained during a lengthened period of formation, that is, about two to three weeks, under the ordinary conditions of health; but, in paralytic cases as in others of feeble health, this period may be doubled. Adams informs us also, that the divided extremities of the old tendon take no active part in the reparative process during its earlier stages, although at the later the cut ends become rounded and their structure softened. They become enlarged and exhibit a tendency to split, and thin streaks of new material similar to that already described are seen between the fibres j tbe ends are joined by tbese means. At a later period, the bulbous enlargement gradually diminishes. When a tendon is divided a second time, there is but little separation of its ends, and this is probably due to adhesion of the new tendon to the neighbouring fibro-cellular tissue, in which fact is found an expla- nation of the unsatisfactory results of second operations. There is no reason for believing, that in the treatment of defor- mities by tenotomy, direct approximation and re-union of the divided extremities of the tendon must first be obtained, and that the required elongation is afterwards to be procured by gradual mechanical exten- sion of the new connecting medium, as we would stretch a piece of india rubber. Gradual mechanical extension, however, is required, in cases of long standing, as in those of congenital origin, to forcibly overcome ligamentous resistance, and to separate the ends of the divided tendons; as it is in those of paralytic and of non-congenital origin to prevent the too rapid separation of the extremities of the tendon. The mechanical extension should be carefully regulated according to the ac- tivity of the reparative process, as indicated by the amount of effusion into the sheath. Blood poured out into the sheath or any inflamma- tory action interferes much with the process of repair; any causes of general feebleness, coldness of the limb, too early, too late, or too for- cible extension, having a like effect. With these remarks the operation itself may be considered. Treatment.—“ The indications,” writes Little, “ are to overcome the shortening of the muscles, ligaments, fasciae, and integuments on the contracted side of the member, to direct the bones into their proper position, to educate the patient’s voluntary use of the parts, to give strength to the muscles and ligaments in the elongated side of the member, and to combat the tendency to relapse.” To fulfil the first indications, mechanical means are often sufficient • and when these fail or are inapplicable, the division of the con- tracted structures. To carry out the other, mechanical means are also of value, aided hy general measures, and more particularly by gal- vanism of the weakened muscles. In a large number of cases, however instruments are not required, much less tenotomy; since in any case' Extension of uniting; medium not required. Gradual mechanical extension. Treatment of talipes.

By splint. of congenital or infantile talipes, when the foot can he brought into its normal position with but little force, a cure without operation can with some confidence be promised. In the very simplest cases, mere friction of the affected limb and the daily extension of the contracted tendons is often enough to effect a cure, the nurse or parent holding the crooked foot for some ten or fifteen minutes two or three times a day in the required position. In the next class of cases, which are slightly worse than the last, in which the foot can he brought with gentle force into its natural place, a cure can he effected by means of strapping adjusted in the fashion depicted below (Fig. 424). The strapping must he of a firm nature; that spread on linen being the best, as made by Messrs. Gerrard and Co., or Leslie, and used at Guy’s. The first piece acts as a kind of splint, and the second by binding down the first to the ankle, admits of any amount of force required to bring the foot in or out, ac- cording to the nature of the case. In a still more severe form, where the former method is inapplicable, a small tin splint covered with leather with a screw hinge at the ankle, such as that advised by Little, Fig. 424.

When necessary. or made for myself by Millikin, of St. Thomas’s Street, may he employed, the foot being forcibly brought into the required position and fixed there by strapping (Fig. 425). In the worst forms, where, by no ordinary force the foot can be brought into the required position, the division of the shortened tendon, tendons, or fascia should be performed, no more structures being divided than are absolutely essential. “ When deciding on the necessity of operation, the surgeon must not be guided solely by the external configuration, but by the amount of firm resistance opposed to restoration, by the depth of the furrows existing in the sole and behind and above the heel, and by the degree of tension of the integuments above the internal malleolus. The deep clefts or furrow's in question denote intensity of contraction of muscles, and closer adhesion than usual of integuments and fascia to the subjacent soft structures and bones. They probably denote, also.319 ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY. that the deformity dates from an early period of uterine existence.”— Little. Sayre’s law upon this point is very good:—“Place the part con- tracted,” he writes, “ as nearly as possible in its normal position by means of manual tension gradually applied, and then carefully retain it in that position; while the parts are thus placed upon the stretch, make additional point-pressure with the end of the finger or thumb upon the parts thus rendered tense, and, if such additional pressure produces reflex contractions, that tendon, fascia or muscle must be divided, and the point at which the reflex spasm is excited is the point where the operation should be performed. If, on the contrary, the additional point-pressure does not produce reflex contractions, the de- formity can be overcome by means of constant elastic tension, and the more you cut, the greater will be the amount of damage done.”— ‘Orthopaedic Surg.,’ 1876. In all cases treatment should be commenced as soon as possible, and Early the foot of the youngest infant may he dealt with advantageously by manual extension a few days after birth. Within a week, extension ‘ hy strapping may be carefully employed, the foot being looked to daily to see that no sloughing or cutting of the skin by the strapping takes place, for in infants the tendons yield far more readily than they do as months or years go on, and with care no harm can accrue from simple mechanical extension. Even splints, carefully applied, can be used. When tenotomy is clearly a necessity—that is, in grave deformities —there is no reason, in a healthy well-developed babe, why it should not he performed within a month after birth. I have divided the tendo Achillis for a talipes varus, with an excellent result at the end of the first week, and Mr. Stromeyer Little has operated successfully within twenty-four hours of the child’s birth. The operation.—In a large number of cases of congenital varus the Direction as division of the tendo Achillis is enough, the foot after division of the to selection tendon being generally capable of restoration to the required position of tenilons- by mechanical means, but in severe examples, the anterior or posterior tibials, singly or together may require to be cut. These three tendons may be divided at one operation in average cases, though in the severe, Little’s advice is good to deal with the tihial tendons first and overcome the inversion of the foot, and, at a later date, to divide the tendo Achillis. The value of this proceeding consists in the fixed os calcis offering a resisting point from which the surgeon is enabled to stretch out and unfold the contracted inverted sole.

The surgeon, To be done during this procedure, should keep his finger upon the tissue to be completely, divided, and immediately on the withdrawal of his knife, close the \ opening with his finger or thumb, the assistant relaxing the parts at the moment he feels resistance to cease.

If any suspicion exist of the posterior tibial artery having been wounded, as indicated by arterial haemorrhage and blanch- ing of the foot, the dressing should be left on for at least a fortnight and all mechanical treatment postponed. It is, however, an exceptional circumstance for any harm to follow the puncture of the artery. Little, with all his experience, informs us that he has only once seen any trouble from this circumstance. After the operation the foot in its deformed position should be bound to a flexible metal splint till the immediate effects of the opera- tion have subsided, after which the mechanical treatment may be com- menced. Division of the posterior tibial tendon should be performed with the child upon its back, with the limb to be operated upon rotated well outwards. The surgeon should take charge of the foot and his assistant of the knee. The tendon should be divided about one inch, or one and a half inch above the extremity of the inner malleolus. In thin subjects, on abducting the foot, the tendon may be felt at the spot indicated; but in fat persons, and when the tendon cannot be made out, the surgeon knows it lies along the inner edge of the tibia, “ exactly midway between the anterior and posterior borders of the leg on its inner aspect.” At this spot the knife should be inserted perpendicular to the surface through the fascia for about half an inch, this opening in the fascia being made sufficiently free to admit of the introduction of the probe- pointed knife, which must next be inserted. This knife can then be introduced perpendicularly close to the bone, between it and the tendon to be divided, when its edge should be turned towards the tendon and the operation completed by a slight sawing movement. It is not always necessary to change knives during this operation, some opera- tors, indeed, never do so. It is safer, however, to adopt the practice in fat subjects when some uncertainty exists as to the exact position of the tendon. As soon as the tendon has been divided, a dossil of lint should be applied, as in the former operation. Some surgeons prefer to divide the tendon of the long flexor muscle at the same time; as a rule, this is unnecessary. Division of the anterior tibial tendon can be performed with the patient lying on his back and the foot extended, the tendon being in this way made prominent in front of the inner malleolus. The knife should be inserted at this point behind the tendon and its edge turned for- ward, when the tight cord can be divided—the foot being at once flexed, and the punctured wound covered with lint and strapping. It ought to be kept in a splint for several days, after division of the tendo Achillis. When all these tendons are divided at the same operation, the after- treatment must be the same. Division of the peronei tendons for talipes valgus is easily accom- plished by adducting the foot and introducing the knife behind the external malleolus, between the tendons and the fibula—the tendons being cut on turning the edge of the knife towards them with a salv- ing movement. Some surgeons advocate a higher division of these tendons to obviate their retraction, union taking place between the tendon and the sheath.ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY. 321 It is unnecessary to describe the operation for division of the plantar fascia or other tendons, as the practice in all should be conducted on principles identical with those already described. Mechanical Treatment.—However necessary these operations Mechanical . • • • j appuauces. may he in any given case, it j,.IQ 426 ought to be remembered that they are only preparatory to the mechanical treatment of stretching which is subsequently to be carried out. That they are not always necessary has already been shown, mechanical treat- ment generally being amply sufficient of itself to effect all the surgeon desires. In one case after the division of the rigid tendon or tendons, a cure may be effected by means of strapping as already illus- trated (Fig. 424); in a second, a simple inside or outside splint with strapping or bandages may he enough. In a third the simple splint figured in Fig. 425 an- swers every purpose; while in a fourth, Scarpa’s shoe is required (Fig. 426), or some of its modifi- cations. A shoe with a ball-and-socket heel-joint, which Messrs. Krohne made for me, is strongly to be recommended, and in Fig. 427 is another, suggested by my colleague Mr. Davies-Colley, which, for extreme examples of talipes, is inexpensive and stands unrivalled. Little’s modification of Scarpa’s shoe for talipes. Fig. 427. Mr. Davies-Colley’s splint for talipes equino-varus. In all, the principle embodied is the same, the separation of the divided ends of the tendon and the deposition of new material between them. The splint invariably should be applied and fixed to the foot in its deformed position, and the stretching process commenced on the third or fourth day, and be completed at the latest by the second week. In many I have brought the foot into position on the third or fourth day, and with nothing but good results. Delay in this matter, as a rule, means failui’e, for the new tissues soon assume a fibrous character, and the deposition of new material takes place only during the early days after the operation. In adults, however, the mechanical treatment may extend over many months. VOL. ii. 21321a ORTHOPiEDIC SURGERY. Operative interference in talipes. Removal of cuboid. ‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1857.

If failure follows the first operation, a second may be performed, but the hope of a successful issue under these circumstances is far from good. Barwell has recently revived the old practice of elastic bands to stretch the tendons in lieu of dividing them; and in some cases it is a valuable practice, hut as a substitute for tenotomy it cannot be recommended. There are, however, cases of talipes equino-varus which are neither amenable to subcutaneous tenotomy nor to mechanical appliances, as well as others which have been treated by these measures and have failed, or which are so severe as to make it certain that a long interval of time must of necessity be spent in the attempt to bring about a cure, even if such a result were probable or possible; and under these circumstances surgeons have sought for more expeditious and efficient means of treatment. With such a view. Dr. Little, the pioneer of tenotomy in this country, suggested, so long ago as 1854, “ that in inveterate varus the treatment might well be commenced in robust subjects by ablation of the os cuboides,” and the late Mr. S. Solly, in 1857, carried the suggestion into effect. The case not proving very successful, the practice met with no encouragement, and the operation was not repeated till Mr. Richard Davy, an old pupil of my own, per- formed it at the Westminster Hospital in 1874, on a boy, set. 15, with such a “ striking immediate result that the sole of the foot could with force be placed in a natural position,” and he repeated it in 1875-76. In 1872, Mr. Edward Lund went a step further, and removed from a , boy, set. 7, both astragali in a case of severe double talipes, with some perceptible improvement. This measure he repeated in March, 1878. In October, 1875, however, my colleague, Mr. Davies-Colley, adopted a new method, and on the suggestion of Mr. Howse, removed from a boy, set. 12, a wedge-shaped piece of the tarsus without paying any regard to its articulations, by means of “ an incision, three inches in length, along the outer border of the left foot, from the middle of the os calcis to the middle of the fifth metatarsal bone, and a second across the dorsum of the foot from the centre of this incision • two inches long. Both feet were operated upon at intervals of six weeks, and in less than ten weeks from the second operation the wounds were quite healed, and the boy could walk without assistance. In No- vember, 1876, Mr. Davy performed the same operation. All these proceedings are sound in principle, and in cases of talipes in which minor measures have been tried and have failed, or in which the probabilities of their success are slight, and time and expense are questions of importance, they should be entertained. I believe, how- ever, that Mr. Davies-Colley’s operation is the best for talipes equino- varus, particularly where the varus is worse than the equinus, though Mr. Lund’s operation is probably of value under the reverse conditions. I say this after having had opportunities of seeing several of Mr. Davy’s and one of Mr. Lund’s cases and having carefully watched throughout its treatment Mr. Davies-Colley’s. Entertaining these opinions, I per- formed Mr. Davies-Colley’s operation on June 18th, 1878, and with such a good result that I now give drawings of the boy’s foot before the operation1 (Fig. 427 A and b) and subsequent to it with an outline of the portion of bones removed (Fig. 427c). l The delay arising from the accidental loss of the MS. of this article during the printing of this work affording me the opportunity of inserting the case.ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY. 322 The case was that of a boy, set. 12, who was born with talipes Example, equino-varus of the right foot, and went under surgical treatment when eight months, and again when five years old, but with no permanent relief. On admission into Guy's, under my care, on June 12th, 1878, the heel of the right foot was much drawn up, and the foot so twisted inwards as to cause the sole of the foot to face the median line of the body, as in a complete subastragaloid dislocation. The head of the Fig. 437a. Fig. 427c. Fig. 427b.

By no force could the foot be restored to a better position, although the tendo-Acliillis and tendon of the posterior tibial muscles could be made tense. Under the circumstances described it was tolerably clear that by no tenotomy or mechanical means could any hope be entertained of restoring the foot to a good position, and I consequently determined to perforin Mr. Davies-Colley’s operation. This I did on June 18th, 1878, by an oblique T-incision of the soft lucision parts, and the application of a keyhole saw beneath the tendons and soft made, parts, made after Esmarch bandages had been applied as a tourniquet. The wedge of bone I removed is represented in Fig; 427c, and was Bones taken out entire, great care being taken to protect the tendons and removed, soft tissues and particularly those of the sole, by the introduction of a flat retractor, during the sawing process. The day following the operation the temperature went up to 102-4°, but fell the next day. On the third day, when the wound was dressed for the first time, it was 99’6°, and during the progress of the case it322a ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY. 1 Clinical 1 Society, 1878. Flat-foot. Treatment.

On July 11th, the bones having fairly united and the wound nearly closed, Davies- Colley’s talipes splint was put on and the limb swung. On Sept. 10th the boy got up, and the sole of the foot was found, on his standing, to be perfectly flat. An immovable splint was then ap- plied, and the boy left for the country. On October 20th he returned to have the tendo-Achillis divided, with the view of giving more movement to the ankle-joint, and some success has followed the measure. He can now (November 10th) walk fairly well, with his foot as flat to the ground as the unaffected one. Spurious valgus, or flat foot. This requires a notice, as it is a common condition and causes much distress. It is found in growing boys aud girls who stand much or take too much exercise, and is the direct result of the giving way or yielding of the ligamentous and fibrous structures of the sole of the foot (Pig. 428); the arch of the foot sinks, the foot and toes become everted, and the peronei muscles contract as a secondary consequence. In extreme cases the movements of the ankle- joints are likewise seriously interfered with. When slight, the deformity can readily be remedied by simply giving rest to the weakened tissues, forbidding standing, and allowing only gentle exercises; also by the use of tonics, &c., during the growing period of life. Mechanical support by means of strapping, in some cases gives great comfort and does good. In a worse class, the introduction of a light steel plate as a support in the hollow of the boot is of great benefit. It is only in very neglected cases that tenotomy can be called for, and this not as a curative means. In examples in which much pain exists, nothing but absolute rest will be of any use; and in such the local signs of inflammation of the overstretched parts can often be read, when fomentations, &c., may be employed. Knock-knee, like flat-foot, is primarily due to the mechanical yielding ofilthe ligaments of the knee-joint from want of power, but at a later date to the overgrowth of the inner condyle of the femur, from the want of the controlling influence of pressure which normally is applied through the leg bones. It is found in growing boys and girls who stand too much or carry heavy weights, and in those of feeble power either from natural or acquired causes. It is not rarely seen with rachitis. . . It can be treated on principles based upon the facts just briefly stated, and not purely by mechanical means. To put irons on the limb of a feeble subject is a mistake, for where the child is too weak to support his own frame without injury, to give him more to carry must be hurtful. Young children should be taken off their legs as much as possible, and provided with proper food and such tonic medicines as seem requisite. The weakened ligaments should have time £iv®n them to contract and become strong. Older children should be limited in the amount of exercise; rest and exercise alternating at regular intervals. When walking half an hour causes pain or323 CONTRACTION OP FINGERS. Ogston’s operation. Fig. 429. Tenotomy in contracted limbs with diseased joints. aching, something less should be allowed, and so on. Exercise sufficient to get and keep the muscles in order may be allowed, but not sufficient to tell upon the weakened ligaments. In other cases, as an additional means, strapping the knees may be of great use; in extreme cases only splints or irons should be employed. These latter instruments when used, should extend from the pelvis to the foot, and be well jointed. Double splints are of little use in these cases, as in the simple they are not wanted, and in the severe they are useless. In very severe examples operative interference may be justifiable. In the ‘Edin- burgh Med. Journal’ for April, 1877, Dr. Ogston reports a case in which by means of Adams’s saw he divided vertically and subcutaneously the inner condyle of the femur (vide Fig. 429), and so forcibly straightened the bent limb with the best result. The operation has been repeated eighteen times since, with good results. When the knees give out instead of in from the same cause, similar principles of practice are applicable. Besides all these recognised affections there are many other conditions in which tenotomy is a valuable operation. Thus, in the contracted limbs which are asso- ciated with bip, knee, or other joint dis- ease, it is often necessary to divide the rigid and contracted tendons or muscles that forbid the limb being straightened by the application of any ordinary or justifiable force; while mechanical means can then complete the object the surgeon has in view. It is better to divide than to tear a tendon. Contractions of the fingers. In this affection where the flexor tendons and the palmar fascia together produce a permanent contraction of first one and then the other finger so as to draw them into the palm, some operation is called for. This affection is curious, generally appears in the little finger, Course, subsequently involving the ring-finger. It often attacks both hands, together or consecutively. It is said to be found more frequently in gouty or rheumatic subjects than in others, but I have failed to verify this statement. It is also difficult to trace the origin of the disease to any local injury; in fact, this affection is somewhat obscure. It may attack the middle finger or any and all of the fingers, but more commonly it is the two outer. From its symmetry it has probably a constitutional and not a local origin. It is often hereditary, but possibly not more so than any other deformity. Treatment—By fixing the contracted fingers in a flexible splint Treatment, and gradually stretching them, much may be done, and in several cases I have effected a complete cure by these means. But it is difficult for men patients to submit to this inconvenience, and, as a consequence, the surgeon is only consulted when the disease is severe and the finger Drawing illustrating Dr. Ogston’s operation.

Under these circumstances, the free division subcutaneously of all the tense tissues may be called for, as recently ably advocated by Mr. W. Adams (‘Brit. Med. Journ.,’ June 29th, 1878). Hi3 operation and treatment is as follows: 1. The subcutaneous division of all the contracted bands of the palmar fascia and its digital prolongations by as many punctures as might be necessary, cutting from above downwards, with the smallest tenotomy knife. 2. Immediate extension of the contracted fingers. The fingers and hand to be bandaged to a splint. 3. The bandage not to be removed until the fourth day, when the punctures will be found to be healed. 4. Extension splint to be worn night and day for two or three weeks, and afterwards at night for three or four weeks, motion being employed every day. Dr. Madelung, of Bonn (‘Berliner Klinische Wochenschrift,’ Mo. 15, 1875), believes that this condition of finger known as Dupuytren’s contraction, is due to the absorption of the numerous small deposits of fat which in healthy young and middle-aged subjects exist between the connective-tissue bands of the palmar fascia and the short fibres which connect this fascia with the superjacent integument. This fascia consequently, under the influence of pressure, falls into a state of chronic inflammation and becomes contracted. He then describes how Busch, of Bonn, treats such cases with great success. In a case, for example, of contraction of the little finger, he raises an angular skin flap from the palm of the hand, its base being at the root of the finger, and then cuts away bit by bit the tense fascia beneath as the finger is being straightened. He then replaces the flap and fixes it with sutures. The finger is left free for some days after this operation, but as soon as granulations appear, a cylinder of wood is placed in the palm for a few days, and after this the finger is extended and kept so by means of a straight splint applied to the back of the hands. This should be re- moved daily and the finger moved. At the end of three or four weeks the hand is left free. Dr. Madelung has never seen this operation fail (‘ Med. Rev.,’ May 26th, 1875). I have adopted this practice in several cases with excellent results. In the same way, one or more toes may be so affected, and tenotomy may be called for. In 1871,1 saw a boy, set. 14, who for years had had repeated attacks of pain and inflammation about his great toe, more particularly after over-walking. He had been under the care of many medical men who had treated him for gout, &c., but who had never compared the sound with the affected toe. When I did this the source of the evil was very apparent, for the long extensor tendon was clearly contracted, and at its insertion into the base of the extreme phalanx there was much thick- ening. I divided the tendon, and recovery at once ensued. The biceps muscle of the arm is also at times so contracted as to prevent extension, and tenotomy may be called for. In fact, any tendon may contract under the influence of disease, and require divi- sion. Rigid atrophy.—Muscles that atrophy occasionally contract and become rigid, but this rigidity must not be mistaken for the spasmodic contraction of a muscle or group of muscles that is so common in pro- gressive disease, more particularly of joint disease, although it often fol-325 WRY-NECK. lows upon that form; indeed, it seems generally to be the consequence of some long-continued spasm, atrophy following from exhaustion, inflam- mation of the muscle, or what is called rheumatism. It is seen more commonly in the flexor muscles of joints than in any other, and, as a special affection in some cases of nory-neck, where the sterno-mastoid muscle is at fault. Treatment.—When the muscles are not too rigid, much may be Treatment done by rapid extension under the influence of chloroform, or gradually by means of splints, manipulation, or india-rubber bands, &c., suited to the wants of the individual case. When these means are ineffectual, or the parts too rigid to allow of their application, the subcuta- neous division of the tendon of the muscle or muscles may he per- formed upon the same principle as tenotomy is practised in contracted tendons. Wry-neck is an example of this affection due to a contracted sterno- Wry-neck mastoid muscle. It may he that the sternal or clavicular origin may he alone at fault, it being exceptional to find both divisions of the muscle affected. Under such circumstances, w'lien the muscle refuses to he Treatment, stretched by mechanical appliances, the half involved alone requires division, followed by extension when union has taken place. In these difficult cases it seems wise, as a rule, not to bring the divided ends of the muscle so closely into contact as the surgeon usually does after division of a tendon. One of the worst cases of the kind I ever had to treat was in a Example, child, aat. 7, in which both origins of the muscle required division. I brought the head up to the required position on the second day, and kept it there, an excellent result ensuing In another which I treated in 1870, in a child, set. 6, with Mr. Duke, of Battle, the muscle of the left side was two inches shorter than that of the right from contraction of its sternal half; I applied extension on the third day, after the division of the con- tracted portion, and brought the head into its right place, keeping up the extension by means of a piece of india-rubber band an inch wide, which was fastened to a skull cap on the opposite side of the head and passed backwards across the shoulders and beneath the axilla of the affected side to fasten to a good thoracic belt (Fig. 430). These cases of wry neck due to contraction of muscles, are always as- sociated with some arrest of growth in the upper and lower jaws on the affected side. Mr. De Morgan informs us (‘ Med.- Chir. Rev.,’ 1866) that in a case that failed to yield under such treat- ment he took away a piece of the spinal accessory nerve with permanent benefit, the steruo-mastoid and trapezius muscles being of necessity paralysed. This operation has been repeated, but without success. * Fig. 430.Division of muscle. Wry-neck resulting from spinal disease. Sprains of joints. Contusion of joints always serious. Treatment. 326 CONTUSIONS, SPRAINS, AND WOUNDS OP JOINTS. The operation of dividing the sterno-mastoid muscle either wholly or in part at its sternal or clavicular origin, must be subcutaneous, and requires much care, for important parts lie behind the muscle which may be injured. A punctured wound should be made over the part to be di- vided with a sharp-pointed tenotomy knife down to the muscle; a blunt - pointed knife ought then to be introduced with its edge turned towards the muscle close to its bony attachment, and all resisting fibres divided by turning the edge backwards, an assistant putting the muscle fully on the stretch; the muscle usually gives way with a distinct snap. The thumb or finger must then be applied to the part and a pad ad- justed, sufficient pressure being made to prevent bleeding, but no more. As already stated, extension should be made early in the case, after the second or third day, and the means adopted in the example quoted seems to be the best; it succeeded at any rate, where the usual instru- ments failed. When both insertions require division, it should be effected by two different punctures. Some surgeons prefer to divide the muscle from behind forward, but there is greater risk of injuring the deep parts by this practice than by the one advised. I need scarcely add that where wry-neck is due to spinal disease, no such treatment as the above is applicable. CHAPTER XXX. CONTUSIONS, SPRAINS, WOUNDS, INJURIES OF JOINTS, AND DISLOCATIONS. Sprains may be very slight or very serious injuries, and are more or less severe overstretchings if not lacerations of the ligaments that bind the bones of an articulation together, In the more severe instances are included lacerations of the muscles, tendons, and soft parts that surround the joint without displacement of the bones. They require rests and time in their treatment in order that repair may be complete; since neglected sprains are often the cause of joint disease. Contusions of joints always ought to be regarded in a serious aspect, for a large amount of internal injury may often be sustained with very slight external evidence of mischief, and, under certain conditions of health, a slight blow or sprain is often enough to set up severe local action or to excite chronic changes which may involve the integrity of the joint. During the period of the growth of bone in children these observations have great force. The nature of the accident and the amount of force concentaited on the joint is the best index to the case, and, under all circumstances, the prognosis should be guarded and the treatment cautious. Treatment.—“ In sprains of joints, rest is the first principle,” said John Hunter in 1787 (MS. Lectures), and at the present day the same words are as pregnant with truth as when first spoken; indeed.SPRAINS OP JOINTS. in simple cases of sprain, by such treatment alone will convalescence Rest, be established. When swelling and effusion into the joint ensue in the course of the second or third day after the accident, the evidence of internal injury is more marked, for such effusion means inflamma- tion or synovitis, which is to be treated by absolute rest, possibly by the application of a splint, the local use of ice, or cold lotion, leeches or warm fomentations, according to the comfort afforded by cold or warmth. If swelling of the articulation follows immediately upon the Where much injury, effusion of blood into the joint is indicated with or without *ft1"^°nice fracture, but always with severe local mischief. Such cases should be treated by the employment of a splint to ensure immobility of the ar- ticulation, elevation of the injured joint with the patient reclining, and the local application of a bag of pounded ice, or irrigation with cold water; these means being maintained until the hsem or rh age has ceased, all risks of inflammation of the joint gone, and repair appears to be going on satisfactorily. As soon as the primary effects of the sprain and all signs of inflammation have passed, the application of pressure to the joint by means of a bandage or strapping with passive move- ment is very striking. When the muscles over such a joint as the shoulder are severely Where bruised by a fall, much local pain may be produced, as well as want of muscles' power in the arm exciting a fear of some bone or joint mischief; but a careful examination will show, if no roughness in the examination be used, that the joint can be passively moved without exciting pain, al- though if the patient attempts to set the muscles in action, pain is pro- duced. This point is one of clinical importance, indicating that the mis- chief is in the muscle and not in the articulation, the pain being ex- cited by muscular action and not by joint movement. In delicate children, all falls upon the hip followed by pain should Contusion of be treated by rest and extreme care; for a large number of cases of hip in hip disease originate from some such slight cause, and there is good children, reason to believe that the majority of liip-joint affections might be prevented by proper attention after slight injury. When the immediate effects of the sprain have passed away, the Affer- local use of some stimulating liniment and moderate friction of the treatment of part expedites the cure, and, at the same time, gives comfort to the contusions- patient. A local warm bath at intervals likewise relieves the stiffness of the joint. Whenever movement excites more than a momentary pain, rest should be observed; and if the pain continue, some chronic inflammatory change ought to be suspected and treated. When weak- ness of the joint aloue remains, a good bandage or strapping around the part to give support is of great benefit. Where much laceration of liga- ment has taken place, it is at times necessary for the joint to have some Artificial permanent artificial support, either in the form of a splint, felt, supports, leather casing, or bandage, for no parts are repaired with less per- manent power than ligaments. In the wrist, when much swelling exists, a sprain may be mistaken Avoid for a fracture or a fracture for a sprain, as fractures about the end of mistaking for the radius are generally impacted, and not consequently attended by fracture' crepitus. Much care is necessary in the diagnosis of such cases. Many sprains of the ankle are also really cases of fracture of the fibula above the malleolus. The popular notion that a severe sprain is worse328 WOUNDS OF JOINTS. On wounds of the joints. Symptoms of a wounded joint. Prognosis guarded. Treatment. Sutures. Splint. Value of cold.

These are always serious accidents, yet as a whole, if treated with discretion and at an early period of their existence, they are fairly successful in their issue. Lacerated, incised, and punctured wounds are met with, and the symptoms that follow any one of these accidents are by no means commensurate with the extent of the local injury, for a slight or punctured wound is often followed by severe and destruc- tive local changes, when an extensive one heals without giving rise to any mischief. A joint is known to be wounded when its contents escape, as synovia has very definite characters, its oily, glutinous nature rendering its flow very manifest. In fat subjects wounds over joints give exit to oily fluid, simulating “joint oil;” such fluid, however, is not sticky when rubbed between the fingers as is synovia. Yet joints are some- times wounded without any evident escape of their contents, and doubtful cases are clinically to be treated as cases of wound. In every case of wounded joint however trivial, and in all doubtful cases of wounded joints, the prognosis must be very guarded and the treatment cautious. Treatment.—The wound should be well cleansed with warm water, and its edges accurately adapted with sutures when necessary. Probing must be avoided and the joint should be kept in absolute repose, the application of a splint being desirable. The best local application is ice or cold-water irrigation; nothing checking pain or subduing in- flammation and effusion better than the constant flow of cold water over the part. The cold, however, to be of value must be persistently applied, as any intermission of its use is almost sure to be followed by increase of pain and effusion. To seal hermetically a wound with a piece of lint soaked in the compound tincture of benzoin, and at the same time apply an ice bag is excellent practice. Should an interval have passed between the receipt of the accident and the application of the cold, and much joint inflammation exist with constitutional symptoms, the application of leeches to the joint, and subsequently of cold, is beneficial. In exceptional examples, where cold is not tolerated, warm fomentations must be substituted. The advocates of the “ spray' system” speaks highly of the plan of applying carbolic acid dissolved in oil to the wounded joint, and lint saturated with the same over the wound. Opium is always of use, the patient being kept fairly under its influence by one grain two or three times a day. Mercury is useless. In very sthenic cases, antimony may be given, and colchicum where gout is suspected. When all acute symptoms have subsided and chronic effusion remains, the application of a blister or blisters expedites the absorption of the effused fluid, and the benefit of pressure by the adjustment of well- applied strapping is very great. In feeble patients, tonics are required. Should suppuration appear, active treatment is called for, such as a free incision into the joint, or other means which will be considered under the head of suppurating joints. Extensive wounds of large joints complicated with other injuries had better be treated by amputation or excision.DISLOCATIONS. 329 DISLOCATIONS. A joint is said to be dislocated when the articular surface of one bone On is displaced from another, and, when the hone is wholly displaced, the aislocatlons- dislocation is called “complete,” hut when otherwise, “'partial or incom- plete. When a wound communicating with the joint complicates the case, it is known as a compound dislocation, and when not so associated, as a simple one. Congenital dislocations are cases of malformation, and the displace- Congenital, ments of bones produced from disease are accidental complications of Pathological a more serious affection. In the present chapter neither of these two displacement, conditions will receive attention. Dislocations are mostly caused by external violence, hut they occa- Causes, sionally occur from muscular action. Dislocation of the lower jaw is the most familiar illustration of this fact. I have known, however, the head of the humerus to be displaced by the exertion used in the violent throwing of a stone, and by the spasm of muscles in an epi- leptic fit. I have, likewise, seen the hip-joint dislocated by mere mus- cular action. Schoolboys are also familiar with the dislocation of the thumb at the carpal joint, which some young persons who possess relaxed ligaments are capable of producing at will. Laceration of the ligaments more or less complete as well as of the Effects, capsular ligament, is a necessary accompaniment of all dislocations, Primary, the muscles and soft parts that surrrouud the injured articulation being likewise, generally much torn. At times the nerves are pressed upon or lacerated, as at the shoulder, and the main artery may be divided in severe injury at the knee-joint. In all joints, more particularly in the ankle, dislocation may be complicated with fracture. After a dislocation has been reduced, most of these injuries are Secondary steadily repaired, although some weakness of the joint often remains, effects, but when nerves have been injured, more or less local complete paralysis or want of power follow in the muscles supplied by the injured nerves. When a dislocation has been overlooked or neglected, other secondary and in a measure reparative changes take place and a new joint is New joint, formed. To effect this, inflammatory products are poured out around the bone in its new position, which organize and ossify (Fig. 431). The cavity thus formed becomes lined with a dense layer of fibrous tissue, putting on the external aspect, and serving instead of cartilage. The head of the bone becomes at the same time altered in shape, and surrounded by the condensed cellular tissue of the part, which answers for a new capsule. A large amount of mobility is often secured, par- ticularly in the ball-and-socket joints. When, however, the original articular cavity be-DISLOCATIONS. 330 Cadge’s case, Diagnosis and symptoms of dislocations. Compare injured side with sound side. Deformity. Loss of voluntary power.

The mobility of joints after dislocation is at times impaired. How long these secondary changes take to form is not yet decided. In some patients they doubtless occur rapidly and in others slowly, as Brodhurst and Fournier both (‘ St. George’s Hosp. Kep.,’ 1868) record a case in which the cartilage of the acetabulum was found healthy, and the cups unfilled, three years and ten years respectively after a disloca- tion. Cadge also records a singularly instructive example (‘ Med.- Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xxxviii) of an unreduced dislocation of the head of the femur upwards between the two anterior spinous processes of the ilium of sixteen years’ standing, in which “ the new bone was deposited in such abundance that it formed a new and complete acetabulum, so complete as, indeed, to hold the thigh bone suspended after all the soft parts were removed, and make it requisite to saw off a large piece of the new bone in order to set the femur at liberty. The new cavity, thin at its walls and smooth on its outside was lined by a dense pearly white tissue which resembled fibro-cartilage. The head of the femur was still covered with cartilage. The old acetabulum had disappeared, partly by the absorption of its cotyloid margin by a deposit of new bone, and partly also by a mass of dense fibrous tissue.” Diagnosis and Symptoms.—-Typical examples of dislocation when seen at an early period of their existence are not difficult of diagnosis; although partial and even complete dislocations, some days after the accident, when swelling of the parts has taken place, are often obscure. The frequency with which such cases are overlooked, even by good men, forbids our saying they can always be made out. In every case of suspected dislocation, the surgeon should compare the sound with the injured side, as in doing this, he will at once detect the most obvious result of any dislocation, deformity, and be able to make out the direction the displaced bone has taken. He, moreover, will see whether the limb is longer or shorter, or more abducted or adducted than its fellow. The patient will not only have lost all power of voluntary movement, but the surgeon, by grasping the affected extremity will probably find when dislocation exists, that the movements of the joints are very limited, and the attempt to move it causes severe pain. There will also be an absence of crepitus, unless some days have passed since the accident, when the crepitus of effusion into the joint or into the bursae about the joint or tendons, will often be felt. Deformity, loss of the power of voluntary motion, and impaired actual mobility, coming on after an accident, are the three most marked symptoms of dislocation. Indeed, these symptoms by themselves, with the absence of crepitus, are usually enough to enable the surgeon to diagnose a dislocation from a fracture, although possibly they are not enough to distinguish it from the separation of an epiphysis. In subjects under the age of 21, the possibility should be entertained of any case of injury about a joint being due to some separation of an epiphysis or complicated with it. With respect to the diagnosis between the separation, of an epiphysis and dislocation Holmes, with his usual clearness, writes upon this point (‘ System,’ vol. v): “ Separations of epiphyses are distinguished from dislocation by the following characters :—(1) TheTREATMENT OF DISLOCATIONS. 331 former can only occur at ages at which the epiphyses are separate from their shafts, the latter at any age. (2) The former are, as a rule, easy to reduce and difficult to retain; in the latter, as a rule, these con- ditions are reversed. (3) In the former, the points of bone imme- diately surrounding the joint preserve their normal relations; in the latter, these relations are variously altered. (4) The sensation perceived in the two injuries is different, for separation of an epiphysis is usually complicated with fracture, and therefore crepitus can be elicited.” Treatment.—In all cases, the reduction of the dislocation should he Treatment of effected as soon as possible, delay being only justifiable when the dislocation, appliances required for the purpose are not at hand or the diagnosis Immediate liy uncertain. Most dislocations, not excluding those of the hip, may be 01 readily reduced directly after their occurrence by extension or mani- tjon p pulation without the aid of an anaesthetic; but, when any time has been allowed to pass and the immediate constitutional effects of the accident have subsided, it is a fair question whether it is advisable to attempt reduction before anrestheticising the patient; for, under the most favourable circumstances, without this aid, much force will to a certainty be called for, whilst with it the gentlest manipulation is often enough. Indeed, I believe it to be wiser for the surgeon to delay When any attempt to reduce a dislocation till an anaesthetic can he obtained delayed, than to make it without, for the slight harm that ensues from the delay £e °'s“(J)rnl to is more than compensated by the great good secured by its use. In no department of surgery is the benefit of anaesthetics better demon- strated than in this, for where force formerly reigned, gentleness now suffices, and where difficulty and pain were common accompaniments, facility of reduction and painlessness are now the rule. Their use has Value'of superseded the old treatment by venesection, tartar emetic, the string wueathetics. of students, and the pulleys. Under then- influence, all muscular spasm ceases to be a force which has to be overcome, and the surgeon has simply to replace the bone through the rent in its capsule, by such gentle manipulative acts as the special requirements of each case appear to indicate. The facility, however, with which a dislocation is reduced by manipulation, turns much upon a surgeon’s knowledge of the way the dislocation was produced, for, in a general sense, the best way to reduce a dislocation is to make the head of the bone retrace the course it followed after it had first burst through its capsule, as the untorn parts in the capsule is doubtless the main obstacle to reduc- tion, muscular spasm being eliminated by the use of an anaesthetic. In neglected cases of dislocation where false joints exist and force In neglected is called for to break them down, pulleys may occasionally be wanted, cases, but they must always be employed with the greatest caution, and under a healthy fear, for not only may the axillary artery be torn aud liga- ments lacerated, but worse injuries may ensue; thus, in Paris, in 1864 the forearm of a woman, set. 64, was torn off at the elbow-joint in the attempt to reduce a dislocation in the humerus, and in London, more recently, the same dreadful accident is reported to have ’taken place. After the reduction of a dislocation, the limb should be kept at rest, After- and fixed by bandages sometimes on a splint, and Sedillot’s rule of treatmeut- “ simply placing the joint in a position the opposite of that in which it was when the dislocation occurred” is sound.

Three or four weeks are at least required for repair to take place before any useful free movement of the joint can be allowed, although when no inflammatory symptoms appear, passive movement may he permitted at the end of two weeks; but, in dislocation of the hip, no walking or standing should be permitted for a month. When reduction cannot he accomplished after a reasonable attempt, a second one may be made at a subsequent period after the effects of the first have passed, that is, if any sound hope exists of success being secured; some modification of the means employed probably suggesting themselves to the surgeon, upon reflecting as to the pecu- liarity of the case and the cause of his failure. When the patient is an adult the difficulties and prospects of the case should be laid before him and his opinion taken; not, however, as to the desirability or the reverse of the attempt, for such an opinion belongs to the surgeon and his colleagues only, hut as to the risks that must he run, for in many cases failure of reduction, more particularly of forcible reduction, is followed by some destruction of the new joint that nature has partially formed, by some inflam- matory change that may end in the destruction of the joint, or in ren- dering its usefulness still less promising. With respect to the propriety of attempting the reduction of an old dislocation, no .definite rules can be laid down, and since anesthetics have been introduced, those originally given by Sir A. Cooper and generally followed, require modification. Sir A. Cooper gave three months as a limit to the attempt in the shoulder, and eight weeks in the hip; yet Sedillot reduced a dislocation of the shoulder more than a year after its receipt, Brodhurst on the 175th day, Smith (D.S.) at the seventh and ^ tenth month; whilst Breschet reduced a dislocated hip on the seventy-eighth day, Travers and my colleague Mr. Durham at the fifth month, Blackman (of Cirencester) at the sixth month. Yet such cases must he rare. Ball-and-socket joints are also more readily replaced than others. The best guides the surgeon possesses for his decision are found in the amount or absence of repair that is present in the dislocated joint. When the movement is good, there is small reason for making the attempt; for, writes Fergusson, “ after three months the use of the limb is not, when reduced, greater than that which it would have acquired in its dislocated state.” When the movements are very limited, a cautious attempt to re- duce the dislocation is hardly likely to be followed by a had result, at whatever period it is made; but, as previously stated, the patient and surgeon should take counsel together on the point and share responsibility. To facilitate the reduction of an old dislocation, it is needless to say, some anaesthetic should be employed, and all adhesions broken down by free rotation or forcible movements of the joint. When this has been effected, the head of the bone ought to be replaced by manipulation, or by slight extension, forcible extension being inadmissible. When tendons are very rigid and forbid movement, they should be divided subcutaneously, but this should be done some days before reduction is fully attempted. Compound dislocation is one of the most serious accidents that can333 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. befall a limb, and in the larger joints is generally complicated with fracture or torn arteries. In the knee-joint the popliteal artery is generally lacerated, and, under such circumstances, amputation is the only resource. In the ankle-joint where the accident is most commonly seen, the case should be treated as one of fracture and wounded joint by immovable splints after its reduction, and the persistent application of cold, either by means of ice or irrigation, In exceptional cases only, when the soft parts are much injured, and in very feeble subjects, ought amputation to be thought of; excision of the articular surface being always a point for consideration. In the elbow where movement is of essential importance, excision had better he performed when the wound is large, although recovery with movement of the joint may take place without it in young adults. Under all circumstances, the dislocation ought to be reduced, the question of excision or amputation turning upon the amount of mischief the soft parts or bones have sustained. Compound dislocations and compound fractures into joints are clini- cally of very similar import. When dislocation and fracture co-exist, difficulties are often met with, hut the reduction of the dislocation is often possible by manipulation aided by chloroform, where, without, it is impossible; and I have re- duced with its aid in one case the head of a fractured humerus from the subglenoid position; and in another a forearm displaced backward with fractured arm-hone, and afterwards in each case adjusted the fracture with facility; I have likewise seen the head of the femur displaced upon the pubes pressed hack into its socket, notwithstanding that a fracture of the shaft existed. I believe that in the majority of these cases the dislocation may be successfully treated before the frac- ture, the fractured hone being at the same time moderately extended. It may be prudent in some to apply splints before attempting the reduction of the dislocation, but such a step is not always necessary or indeed advisable, for with the limb encased in splints the surgeon has less influence upon the dislocated hone. When the dislocation cannot be reduced, the fracture must he dealt with in the ordinary manner. In a case I recently had under care, of a woman, set. 66, in which the head of the femur was dislocated into the sciatic notch and an impacted fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone co-existed, a good limb was secured. DISLOCATIONS OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Dislocations of the spine and lower jaw have been considered in former chapters (pages 269 and 551, vol. I). Those of the upper extre- mity will now occupy our attention. Dislocations of the Clavicle. Dislocations of this bone at its sternal end are rare accidents, though according to Flower they form about 3 per cent, of all dislocations of the upper extremity. They are produced by violence applied to the shoulder, when the scapula is fixed, the clavicle being forcibly thrown towards the mesial line. Dislocation downwards is an impossibility, On dislocation with fracture. Fracture and dislocation. Dislocation of the clavicle.334 DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE. Dislocation forwards. Characters. Treatment. Dislocation upwards. Characters the cartilage of the first rib preventing; but it may take place for- wards, upwards, or backwards, and may be partial or complete. Dislocation forwards is usually caused by some violent pressure of the shoulder backwards, although Melier (‘ Archives Gen. de Med.,’ tom. xix) records a case in a child where it was produced by simply pulling the arm. The head of the bone in this accident forms a marked feature, and cannot be mistaken for anything else| (Fig. 432). When the dislocation is partial, some unusual prominence of the end of the bone on comparing it with its fellow will suggest its nature, the bone being only covered with skin and readily pressed back. When complete, the nature of the acci- dent will be still better marked; and the end of the bone will be usually found pointing downwards. Inflammatory thickening of the joint should not be mistaken for partial displacement. Treatment.—There is usually little or no difficulty in reducing this form of dislocation, by forcibly drawing back the shoulder and applying pressure to the dis- placed bone; though there is great difficulty in keeping the bone in its normal position; indeed, as a rule, it is quite impossible to do this satisfactorily. A pad in the axilla, with a figure-of-8 bandage to keep the shoulder outwards, the elbow being bound to the side, will do much towards the desired end; and a pad of lint applied outside the displaced end of the clavicle, and firmly fixed in position by strapping carried over the shoulder and scapula, has a very bene- ficial tendency. Nelaton advised the use of a common hernia truss. The surgeon, however, must expect a certain amount of failure in the treatment of these cases, though he may safely assure his patient that the usefulness of the arm will be but little, if at all, impaired. I have had one case of this dislocation combined with fracture of the sternal end of the bone, in which no harm followed its non- reduction. Dislocation upwards is very rare. Malgaigne has recorded four such cases, Hamilton another, described by Dr. Rochester, of Buffalo, and Dr. R. W. Smith a sixth (‘Dublin Journal of Medical Science/ 1872). In 1865, such a case came under my care. It was in a young woman, a milliner, set. 20, who two years before was violently crushed in a crowd, the violence causing pain which was referred to the upper pai-t of her chest. She was treated at home and got well, although with a deformity, for which she consulted me. On examining her chest, both clavicles were resting upon the border of the sternum, behind the sternal tendons of the sterno-mastoid muscles, and, with the slightest pressure upon the shoulders, the two ends could be made to meet. By drawing the shoulders backwards, the bones could be separated and pressed back into what appeared to be their normal position, but no appliance could keep them here. The patient had good movement in her arms, and followed her occupation. I have Fig. 432. Dislocation of sternal end of clavicle, forwards. Drawing 27ai, Guy’s Mus.DISLOCATIONS OF SCAPULA. 335 the notes also of a second case that came under my care in 1863, in a man, set. 35, produced by a fall on the shoulder. In the Guy’s Museum (129290) there is a specimen of dislocation of the clavicle at its sternal end upwards and forwards. Treatment.—In the treatment of this as of the last form of disloca- Treatment, tion, there is no difficulty in reducing it by drawing outwards the shoulders and applying pressure upon the bone, but there is much in keeping the bone in position. The best means, however, are the applica- tion of a pad over the hone, the firm pressure of the scapula against the ribs by means of broad hands of strapping, and the supine position. Under all circumstances, the surgeon may comfort the patient by the assurance, that good and useful movement of the arm will be secured. Overhand movements, however, will always be difficult. Dislocation backwards stands next in point of rarity to that of Dislocation dislocation upwards, and is usually caused by violence, forcing the backwards, shoulder, forwards or by direct force. I have seen but one such case, Examples, in a man, set. 52, who was crushed by falling bricks, and in it the dis- location was self-reduced on the second day, when the man was in bed. The displaced clavicle presses at times upon the trachea and oesophagus, so as to interfere with respiration and deglutition. In 1845, a sailor, set. 17, was admitted into Guy’s with such an injury, the dislocation having been caused by a blow on the shoulder. It was easily reduced by drawing the shoulders back, and maintained in situ without diffi- culty. Cases of this kind have been recorded by Mr. Brown, of Cal- lington (‘ Med. Gaz.’, 1845), and M. Pellieux, 1834 (‘ Revue Medicale.’ In one singular case recorded by Sir A. Cooper, the dislocation was produced by curvature of the spine, and Mr. Davie, of Bungay, excised the sternal end of the displaced bone to prevent death from suf- focation. Mr. C. De Morgan has recorded a case in ‘ Holmes’s System,’ vol. ii, p. 805, in which, in a girl, set. 10, the bone was thus) displaced and successfully treated by means of a splint across the shoulder, with a pad between it and the spine, the shoulders being drawn to the splint by a bandage and the child kept in bed. The splint was removed at the end of a fortnight, and the articulation in four weeks became as firm as that on the other side; the arm, moreover, could he moved with- out causing any pain. Dislocation of the Scapula was formerly called dislocation of the acromial end of the clavicle; but Dislocation of as the clavicle is a fixed point, it seems only consistent with common scapula, or sense, although not with custom, to follow Skey, Maclise, and Flower, lIisIoCfltjon of and call what have hitherto been described as dislocations of the aero- of davide™1 mial end of the clavicle, dislocations of the scapula. In the more usual form of this accident, the acromion process of the scapula is forced beneath the clavicle. In rare cases, it may be re- ceived above it. Both are commonly caused by direct violence to the p shoulder. Lauses. The symptoms are well marked in both forms; the falling of the Symptoms shoulder and projection upwards of the acromial end of the clavicle in one (Fig. 433), and the projection upwards of the acromion process of the scapula in the other, prevent any mistake heina made. 8 Ireatment.

The belt presses the clavicle downwards, aud raises the shoulder and arm up- wards. The parts fall into position at times when the patient assumes the hori- zontal posture, and when this is the case, and the position can be maintained for two or three weeks, it is well to adopt it. At others a pad fixed over the clavicle by means of strapping, or a bandage passed between the axilla will suffice; but the surgeon recognising the special wants of the case, must adapt his means to meet them in the best possible way. Good movements of the arm are, as a rule, acquired in time after either of these accidents. Dislocation of tlie scapula dowmvards. Mr. Poland’s case.

Statistics. In 40 out of 60 consecutive cases, or in two-thirds of them, I found a direct blow upon the shoulder was the cause of the accident, while in the exceptional cases, a fall upon the extended arm or elbow, or a for- cible dragging backwards of the arm, was the assigned cause. The accident is rare in childhood, although I have seen an instance of it at the age of 13; while Flower and Hulke have recorded a case in an infant 14 days old. Two thirds of the cases are found in men between 50 and 70 years of age, it being comparatively rare in women and in young adult life. I have, however, treated one in a man aged 75.

Out of 60 cases, 31 were subglenoid, or downwards; 25 subcoracoid, or forwards; and 4 subspinous, or backwards. 49 were in males, aud 11 in females. 4 were in subjects under 20 years of age. 17 „ „ between 21 „ and 50. 38 ,, ,, „ 51 „ 70. 1 aged 75.

When the coracoid process has been broken off, the head of the humerus may be displaced over the root of the former; two or three such cases being on record.DISLOCATIONS OF THE HUMERUS. 337 Snbcoracoid.—This is probably the most common form of dislocation, but the statistics I have given place it second on the list. Flower has shown, however (‘ Path. Soc.,’ vol. xii) that 31 out of the 41 specimens of dislocation of the shoulder-joint found in the London Museums belong to the subcoracoid class. In it the head of the humerus rests on the anterior lip of the glenoid cavity beneath the coracoid process, or even more forwards, the completeness of this dislocation turning upon the Fig. 434 Sulylenoid From Mr. Flower’s models, Middlesex Hosp.

When they are completely torn through at their insertion into the great tuberosity of the humerus, or the tuberosity is torn off, the head of the hone will he more forward than when they are only stretched or partially divided. Many of the cases described by Sir A. Cooper as dislocation downwards, or as partial dislocation, were doubtless of this kind; and many others re- corded as examples of subcla- vicular, are nothing more than specimens of this variety. (Fig. 434.) Symptoms.—The symptoms of this form of dislocation in their general character are the same as in most others, such as inabi- lity to move the arm, immobility and pain often passing down some nerve trunk, and aggra- vated by movement. On look- ing at the part and comparing the injured with the sound side before swelling has appeared, some striking points will be ob- served, such as flattening of the deltoid, prominence of the acro- mion, and a depression beneath it. Extra prominence will also Subcoracoid dislocation of bead of humerus. Drawing 27“. VOL. II. 22 Subcoracoid dislocation.

Symptoms. be seen below the coracoid process, from the head of the bone pushing forward the pectoral muscle (Fig. 435); from behind, too, there will be some flattening of the shoulder. There will be little or no lengthening of the limb, but the elbow will be found projecting more or less from the side; the movements of the forearm will be perfect. On manipulating the shoulder, the head of the bone will be felt beneath the pectoral muscle in front of the scapula, and from the elbow it will be made to move. Dislocation downwards or subglenoid—although usually given as the most common—is probably se- cond in frequency to the subcoracoid just described. Flower asserts that not one in ten of all dislocations of the humerus can properly be called subglenoid. In it the head of the bone rests below the glenoid fossa (Fig. 434), the rent in the capsule being at its infe- rior instead of its anterior border, and the soft parts mechanically interfering with the natural ten- dency of the deltoid, coraco-brachialis, and biceps to draw the head of the humerus upwards towards the coracoid process. Symptoms.—The most constant are immobility of the arm, as well as inability to move it without pain, with a greater separation of the elbow from the side, a more marked flattening of the shoulder, greater de- pression beneath and extra prominence of the acromium than are met with in the subcoracoid variety. The most typical, however, are a depression of the anterior fold of the axilla from a drawing down of its attachment, the marked presence of the head of the bone in the axilla, and the separation of the coracoid process and the head of the mal- placed bone by a space of one to two inches (Fig. 436). Dislocation backwards or subspinous. This is next in rarity to the last, and in it the head of the bone rests beneath the spine of the scapula or base of the acromion (Fig. 437); the latter position being a less complete luxation than the former, and more common. It corresponds to Malgaigne’s “ subacro- mial” variety, this completeness of the dislocation depending upon the amount of laceration of the muscles attached to the bone, and more particularly of the subscapularis. The symptoms of this accident are very marked. Looking at the shoulder in front, there will be the flattening of the deltoid and pro- minence of the acromium as usual, but there will be a marked flat- tening if not depression of the soft parts below the coracoid and acromion processes. The elbow instead of being fixed away from the side will be drawn to it and forwards, the forearm generally pointing outwards. The back view, however, is the most typical, the head of the bone covered with muscles and soft parts forming a prominent fea- Fig. 436.DISLOCATIONS OF THE HUMERUS. 339 ture in the case (Fig. 438). I had a patient under observation about thirty years of age, who could at will dislocate her shoulder in t ns direction by muscular action. In this dislocation the limb is said to be slightly longer than normal, but I have not found it so. Fia. 437. /Sui-spinous jSu7>- clavicular From Flower’s models, Middlesex Hospital. Subspinous dislocation of head of humerus. Subclavicular dislocations, in which the head of the humerus rests 0,1 below the clavicle ou the sternal side of the coracoid process are exceed- IocutiaF ingly rare (Fig. 437). I have never seen a complete example. Mal- gaigne informs us that in it the arm is pressed against the chest with the elbow slightly removed from the side, the head of the bone being felt and seen in its abnormal position, and the shaft instead of the head of the humerus felt in the axilla. The bulk of cases recorded as of the subclavicular kind are probably subcoracoid. The supracoracoid dislocation is a mixed form of accident, as it is The secondary to a fracture of the coracoid process. Malgaigne has re- supra- corded an example, and Holmes, in the * Med.-Chir. Trans./ vol. xli, a second, with an account of the dissection of the case, the preparation being in St. George’s Museum. He also describes a third which occurred in the practice of Mr. P. Hewett. Some points in diagnosis remain to be told, and the most important Important was pointed out by the late Mr. T. Callaway in his excellent Jacksonian P?int thc Prize Essay for 1849, which is: “ That in taking the vertical cir~ these'08'3 °f cumference of any shoulder in which dislocation exists by means of a dislocations. tape carried over the acromion and under the axilla, an increase of about two inches over the sound side is an invariable concomitant.” The same author also shows, how elongation of the limb does not take place, at any rate, to any extent; the different accounts given by authors on this point depending upon the fact, that they are content with optical rather than actual measurement. Professor Dugas, of Georgia, Dugas’s guide has also pointed out (‘Southern Med. and Surg. Journal,’ 1856) at0®aon081s- sign of dislocation of the shoulder-joint that merits more notice thanDISLOCATIONS OP THE HUMERUS. 340 Dislocation associated with fracture. Mistaken for displacement off epiphysis. On the treatment of dislocation of the humerus. Mode of reduction by manipulation. it lias received, and I am indebted to Dr. W. Briggs, of Nashville, for calling my attention to it. It is based upon the physical fact, that in consequence of the rotundity of the thoracic walls, it is impossible for loth ends of the humerus to touch them at the same time. “ If the fingers, therefore, of the injured limb can be placed by the patient, or by the surgeon, upon the sound shoulder while the elbow touches the thorax, a condition that obtains in the normal condition of the joint, there can be no dislocation. And if this cannot be done there must be one, for no other injury than a dislocation can induce this physical impossibility.” Dr. F. Hamilton has likewise shown (‘ Lond. Med. Rec.,’ April, 1875) how in a dislocation, a rule will touch, at the same time, the acromion process and the elbow of the injured side, a condition that cannot exist in health. It sometimes happens, that the head of the bone after its apparent reduction, fails to remain in position and falls out again; and when this occurs, it becomes a question whether some part of the glenoid cavity is fractured or some other fracture exists. I have recently seen a case of dislocation of the head of the humerus forwards and downwards, in which a portion of the glenoid cavity was broken off and displaced downwards, associated with severe injury to the radio-spiral nerve. In children or young persons under twenty-one, the upper epiphysis of the humerus may be separated, or rather the shaft of the humerus may be displaced off the epiphysis, which retains its normal position, and, under these circumstances,the arm should be most carefully manipulated under chloroform, to make the diagnosis sure. In exceptional cases, however, this slipping out again is not to be explained by these com- plications ; for, in the case of a man set. 75, who had a dislocation back- wards, the head of the bone could not be kept in position till the muscles began to act after the effects of the chloroform had subsided, and I had to hold the bone in place till the patient recovered, and the muscles acted naturally. Treatment.—The use of anaesthetics has completely revolutionised the treatment of dislocations, and, at the present day, nothing can usually be simpler than the reduction of a dislocation of the shoulder, and what was formerly called reduction by stratagem is now the rule. “ If you can get a person off his guard,” wrote Abernethy, “ you have first to put your hand up to the head of the bone, depress the elbow, and it will sometimes succeed in putting it in,” and the modern surgeon, in describing the reduction of dislocations by manipulation, might use the same language. To reduce a dislocated humerus by manipulation, chloroform is essential, and when the patient is fully under its in- fluence as vvell as in the horizontal position the surgeon should grasp the shoulder with one hand, and the flexed elbow with the other (Fig. 439, a). When the dislocation is subglenoid or subcoracoid, the thumb of the surgeon may be placed over the head of the bone, and the fingers ovei the spine of the scapula, the thumb acting as a fulcrum; with the other hand the flexed elbow should be drawn from the side and extension made, some slight rotatory movement outwards being employed. When extension has been carried to its full extent, the elbow should then be raised and the arm made to describe a semicircle in the direction of the sternum and the face, and then suddenly brought down to. the side o the thorax, the head of the humerus at the same time being rotated inwards. The thumb of the opposite hand should give the right diree-341 DISLOCATIONS OP THE HUMERUS. tion to the head of the bone. (Fig. 439, n.) Should the first attempt fail, a second may succeed, or possibly a third. In the majority of disloca- tions of the shoulder, this method will succeed. In Philadelphia, this practice is known as H. Smith’s method. In the dislocation backwards Fig. 439. a b Extension, adduction and rotation outwards. Fig. 440. or subspinous, the same method will suffice, but in that case, the head of the bone being behind the glenoid cavity, requires pushing forwards. Under such circumstances, the surgeon should stand slightly behind the patient with one hand grasping the axilla with the thumb behind, and with the other the elbow, making extension; reduction may then be effected by drawing the elbow backwards and rotating the bone. By these means, I easily reduced an interesting case of dislocation backwards (subspinous) complicated with fracture of the ribs of the same side and of the opposite clavicle. When these means fail, or when chloroform is not at hand, reduction by means of extension with Extension by the heel in the axilla should be employed, the surgeon with his unbooted heel in axilla, heel pressing upon the head of the humerus or lower border of the axilla, and with his hand grasping the forearm of the misplaced limb, and making steady extension; some slight rotatory movement often facilitates re- duction. The head of the bone usually slips into its place with a perceptible jerk, and the moment this is felt, all extension should be stopped. To facilitate extension, the clove hitch (Fig. 440) may be employed; and, instead of the heel, Mr. Skey’s well-padded iron knob. Mr. W. F. Teevan informs me that be has known the third rib to be fractured in the attempt to reduce a dislocation of the head of the humerus with the foot in the axilla. If the humerus still resists, the following plan, writes Hulke (‘Holmes’s w„n.p>« Surgery,’ vol. ii, 1871, “ which I have never known to fail in a recent P dislocation, may be tried. The patient is seated in a high chair which is placed about two feet from the post of an open doorway • the surgeon, having his back against the doorpost, places one foot upon the side of the chair, and with his knee presses into the axilla and with both hands upon the shoulder, steadies the patient’s body - a jack towel is then fixed by a clove-hitch knot to the patient’s arm just above the elbow, and by its means two or three assistants’DISLOCATIONS OF THE HUMERUS. 342 Extension upwards.

Cooper’s plan of bending the extended arm over the knee, placed in the axilla with the patient sitting, using the humerus as a lever; and is, doubtless, a good one. Should these means fail, success may be secured by drawing the arm vertically up- wards, as practised by White, of Man- chester, in 1764, and recently advocated by Mr Lowe, of Burton-on-Trent (‘ St. Barth. Rep.,’ 1870). In 1864,1 succeeded by these means in the case of a subglenoid disloca- tion of one month’s standing, in a man set. 64, the method of manipulation and exten- sion having failed; and again, more recently, in a similar case of twenty-four hours’ standing, in a gentleman, set. 30, when every other means had proved unsuccessful (Fig. 441). Mr Lowe places his patient in a sitting posture on the floor, and then stands behind himonasofa forcibly extending the dislocated arm upwards, the scapula being kept fixed by the surgeon’s foot. In all cases, the extension should be gradual and steady, the counter-extension effective; no jerking or great force should he allowed; pulleys are to he looked upon as dangerous appliances; with the use of anesthetics they should be abandoned. In recent disloca- tions they are never needed ; and in the old, adhesions should be broken through by forcible rotation and flexion of a joint rather than extension. Extension forwards is at times beneficial. It proved successful in my hands in a case of subspinous dislocation of three weeks’ standing in a man, set. 75. In a neglected dislocation of twenty-five days’ standing, Mr. Cock succeeded in 1859 (vide author ‘ On Diseases and Injuries of Joints,’ 1859) by the following plan, all other means having failed :—“An air- pad, made of vulcanised india rubber, was placed in the axilla, and the arm firmly bandaged to the side, the air-pad thus being made to exert a powerful outward pressure upon the head of the bone. Upon removing the bandage upon the third day, the head of the bone was found to have returned to its natural position.” Without chloroform, obstacles to the reduction of a dislocation of the shoulder are muscular spasm, and the difficulty of replacing the head of the bone through the rent in its capsular ligament. With chloroform, the resistance of the muscles is an element which has not to be considered, the second one alone existing. In old dislocations, the presence of adhesions is an extra element of difficulty. After the reduction of a dislocation the arm should be bound to the side for a week, and kept at rest for a fortnight or more, all violent exertion being forbidden for several mouths, the object being to give time for the injured parts to recover their power, and ruptured muscles to unite or form fresh adhesions. It happens at times that the trunks of the nerves are so injured as norizontady outwards. Fig. 441. Reduction by extension of arm downwards.DISLOCATIONS OF THE HUMERUS. 343 to give rise to paralysis of the muscles supplied by them. I have seen, Paralysis as in one case, the parts supplied by the ulnar nerve permanently para- a result- lysed; and, in another, those supplied by the musculo-spiral. It is by no means uncommon to find the circumflex nerve so injured as to be followed by a most complete wasting of the deltoid muscle. In many cases, however, in which paralysis follows dislocation, recovery may May be eusue, and in a very marked example I saw in 1874, in which Jreo^vere paralysis of all the parts supplied by the radio-spiral nerve was most complete, recovery took place in fifteen months. The axillary artery may likewise be lacerated. Callender (St. Barth. Rep.,’ 1866) has recorded such a case; and Dr. R. Adams dl elJ (‘ Cyclo. Anat. and Phys.,’ art. “ Shoulder,” p. 416) another. In neglected dislocation of the shoulder it is always a difficult ques- Expediency tion to decide as to the expediency of attempting reduction. Sir °1(1re ucl"" A. Cooper used to say, that after twelve weeks’ rest, an attempt should dislocations not be made, and, in a certain sense, such an opinion is correct; but there are many cases of less standing in which the attempt would be wrong, and some few of much longer standing, in which it would be right. Where good movement exists after twelve weeks, there is little need for the attempt, unless under exceptional conditions. When bad move- ment exists, or none at all, the attempt may be made, for cases are on record in which reduction has been effected after a year or more. Fracture and dislocation of the head of the humerus occasionally occur Fracture with together, and, when the dislocation can be reduced at once, as it may by means of chloroform, so much the better. When it cannot, the fracture humerus, must be treated and the dislocation left alone, good movement at times being the result. In Fig. 442 such a complication existed. The preparation was taken from a gentleman, ret. 64, three months after the injury before union had taken place at the seat of fracture. Compound dislocations of the shoulder are grave accidents, and, when Compound the soft parts have been much injured, the best plan is probably to o|3'i°gat'oris resect the head of the bone, although when the wound is limited or shoulder, clean and reduction easy, it may be right to treat the case as one of wounded joint. Dislocation of the Elbow. This accident is most com- mon in early life, and accord- ing to the Middlesex Hospital table (‘Holmes’s Syst., vol. ii.) more than half of the cases oc- curred in boys between the ages of five and fifteen. Dr. Hamil- ton found 19 in children under fourteen years of age, out of 33 cases. At Guy’s, these pro- portions are not quite so large, for out of 13 cases, 6 were in subjects between ten and twenty; 3 between twenty and thirty; 3 between thirty and forty, and one between forty and fifty. In only one case was Fig. 442. Coracoid Jlrromlon. On dislocations of the elbow. Dislocation of the head of the humerus asso- ciated with fracture. Prep. HU3®, Guy’s Hosp.

Both bones may be displaced backwards, outwards, inwards, or for- wards, backwards and outwards, or backwards and inwards. The ulna may be displaced backwards alone, the radius maintaining its natural posi- tion ; and tbe head of the radius may be thrown forwards or backwards. These dislocations may be more or less complete, simple or com- pound ; uncomplicated, or complicated with fracture of one or more of the bones entering into the formation of the joint, or with displace- ment of an epiphysis. In point of frequency, dislocation of both hones backwards is the most common, the other dislocations of both bones occurring in the order above given; dislocation forwards being so rare that without a fracture, its existence was doubted by Sir A. Cooper, but Velpeau and Canton have each recorded undoubted examples. The force required to produce any one of these injuries is severe. It is generally exerted directly upon the elbow, or indirectly upon the hand, either by a fall or twist. To admit of any dislocation, there must of necessity be much laceration of the ligaments. Symptoms and diagnosis. These accidents are not difficult to diagnose when they are seen at an early period of their existence, though after the lapse of some hours, great difficulty may be ex- perienced owing to the swelling masking the points of bone, and rendering it difficult to make out their relative positions. The injured joint should always be carefully examined, each point of bone felt for, and its relative position with other points compared with those of the sound limb, although, too, in all forms of dislocation or fracture about joints, the surgeon should compare the sound with the in- jured side, in none can he derive greater assistance, or feel more forcibly the value of the rule than in dislocations of the elbow. The student should accustom himself to the manipulation of healthy joints, and learn where to place his finger upon their different prominences and de- pressions ; and having learned the normal conditions, he will find usually but little difficulty in discovering when a displace- meut has occurred. When both bones are dislocated back- tvards (Fig. 443), the forearm is par- tially flexed and the hand slightly pronated; the displaced bones project backwards and make a prominent swell- ing with the tendon of the triceps, while the condyles of the humerus can readily be felt in front pushing the artery and soft parts forward; the inner condyle Dislocation of radius and ulna backwards.

In thin subjects, the olecranon and the head of t' radius can readily be felt in their abnormal position, and the head ot the latter bone made through the hand to rotate in its new situation. In the dislocation of the bones outwards, the marked prominence of Dislocation the inner condyle of the humerus as seen from behind is a typical feature outwards. (Pig. 444), and, with luxation of the same bones inwards, the external condyle is prominent. In the rare form of dislocation fonvards (Pig. 445), the loss of the olecranon from its right position, the unusual prominence of the con- dyles of the humerus, and the marked elongation of the forearm, are the chief features. In dislocation of the ulna back- wards, the pronation and twisting inwards of the hand, the great shortening of the ulnar side of the forearm, and projection backwards k of the olecranon, mark the nature 1 of the accident. When tho head of the radius is displaced alone forwards (Pig. 446) or backwards, its absence from its natural position, as well as its presence in an unnatural one, can usually be made out. In the forward disloca- tion the flexion of the joint is limited. In the backward (Pig. 447), the movements may be complete; more commonly, however, they are limited.

Occasionally extension of the forearm is required, or the forcible bend- Fig. ing of the forearm over the surgeon’s knee or thumb, but in the majority of early cases the joint may be moulded into its normal position. When some weeks have have been allowed to pass without reduction, consider- able force may be required to Dislocation of the bead of the radius back- break down the adhesions, wards. forcible flexion and extension being then applicable. Up to two months, any dislocation of the elbow may be reduced, or rather an attempt at reduction may be made. After that date when useful movement has become possible, the attempt had better not be entertained. When no movement exists, it is, however, justifiable, but no definite rule can be laid down on this point, since each case must be judged upon its own merits. I have reduced, after nine weeks, a dis- location of the bones of the forearm backwards, with an excellent result, and have failed after five. What would be justifiable under some circumstances would be unjustifiable in others, the age of the patient, his position or occupation, and necessities, having as great an influence in guiding the surgeon as the time that has elapsed after the accident, and the amount of useful movement in the joint. Wheuboth bones are displaced, or the ulna alone, the surgeon should grasp the forearm as a whole. When the radius is the bone displaced, the extending force should be applied from the hand. After the reduction of the dislocation, the arm should be kept in a splint and cold lotion or ice applied, according to the amount of in- flammation that ensues. When little inflammation follows, passive movement may be allowed in about ten days or a fortnight. After the reduction of a dislocation of the head of the radius forwards, there is usually great difficulty experienced in keeping the bone in its position. To effect this, I have found the forced flexion of the forearm the best, the wrist and forearm being bound by means of a bandage to the arm. In a recent case the benefit of this practice was well displayed. When reduction of a neglected dislocation has been effected, it is wise to fix tbe elbow on an angular splint for ten days or a fortnight and to apply cold water, and, after all inflammatory action has subsided, to allow of passive or, possibly, forcible movements, as a stiff elbow joint is a misfortune of no mean importance, and to prevent it measures may be employed which, under other circumstances, might be considered rash. In neglected cases, where reduction is beyond all hope, the surgeon may use a considerable amount of force to flex the forearm to a right angle, in which position it should be fixed. In compound dislocation of tbe elbow-joint wbere reduction is pos- sible and the wound small, tbe case may be treated as one of wounded joint, viz. by splints and the application of ice, good hopes existing of a sound recovery being secured with movement. When the wound is347 DISLOCATIONS OP THE WRIST. large and the soft parts are materially injured, excision of the joint should be performed, the success attending this practice generally being very satisfactory. When the vessels and nerves are clearly so in- jured as to preclude the possibility of a useful limb being secured amputation may he required. In all these dislocations of the elbow, the surgeon should he careful to ascertain that they are uncom- plicated ; that no fracture co-exists; or, what is more common in young subjects, that no displacement of the lower epiphysis of the humerus is present, such as is shown in Fig. 448. This can only he made out by a careful comparison of the sound and injured sides, and the appreciation of the crepitus of fracture, the crackling of effusion, and the semi-crepitating feel of a displaced epiphysis. Dislocations of the Wrist. These are exceedingly rare accidents, the majority of cases recorded nisIoc t- as being of this nature being fractures of the lower end of the radius, of the wrist. What is known as Colies’s fracture is the more common form of accident. Dupuytren pointed this out years ago, and the truth of the observation is now fairly recognised. When dislocation does occur the hand is displaced either forwards or backwards, the ends of the radius Hand and ulna forming prominent points in the opposite positions, and the fonvards- styloid processes of the radius and ulna being recognisable points in a line with the shafts of the bones of the forearm (Fig. 449). This feature is important, for when the displacement of the hand is due to a fracture of the lower ends of the radius and ulna, the styloid processes will be in connection with the hand, instead of the shafts of the bones. Treatment.— Reduction by manipulation is readily performed, extension of the hand and direct pressure upon the displaced bones, as a rule, effecting the sur- geon’s purpose. The parts should be kept in position by an anterior and a poste- rior splint extending to the flexure of the finger. The splints should be removed, however, as soon as the parts have become firm, and pas- sive movement of the fingers should be enforced. Dislocation of the lower end of the radius with the hand may take Dislocation of place whenever the hand is forcibly pronated or supinated. When lower end °f forcibly pronated, the ulna projects backwards, and the radius and baud radius' forwards; when supinated, the reverse conditions are found to exist. Fig. 449. Treatment.

The dislocation had taken place some months previously, and had never been reduced. It was the result of a fall upon the dorsum of the hand. Pronation and supination of the hand were limited, and the ulna was fixed in its new position. The hand was more pronated than natural, but very useful. Fig. 450. Dislocation of the hand and radius forwards off the ulna. Such dislocations are readily reduced by extending the hand and also by the application of pressure to the displaced bones. After their re- duction, anterior and posterior splints should be applied for two or three weeks to prevent the bones slipping out of position, and to allow the ligaments time to unite. In the case figured no treatment was available. Dislocation of Dislocation of the carpal bones is an occasional though rare acci- carpal bones. deu^ and the displacement of the os magnum backwards, from a fall upon the flexed hand, is the most frequent form. I have known this to occur in a woman during the efforts of parturition in grasping a towel and forcibly bending the wrists, the bone being pressed out of its connection. When the accident occurs, the prominent head of the bone on the dorsum of the wrist in a line with the metacarpal bone of the middle finger is too marked a feature to allow of there being any difficulty in the diagnosis. The bone, as a rule, is easily reduced by pressure, and kept in position by means of a pad. This pad must be maintained in position for many weeks after the accident, to allow time for the ligaments to consolidate. South, in a note to his translation of Chelius, records a case in which the 'pisiform tone was displaced ; while Fergusson and Erichsen describe others caused by overaction of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Erichsen also Of semilunar, mentions a dislocation backwards of the semilunar bone, and in St. George’s Hospital Museum there is a specimen of compound dislo- cation of this bone on both sides, occasioned by a fall from a height upon the hands, in which the bones were pressed out of a wound in front of the wrist. Maisonneuve has recorded (f Mem. de la Soc. de Chir.,’ tome ii) a case, in which the second row of carpal bones was displaced backwards from the first; and Erichsen another in which the metacarpal bones were displaced backwards from the carpus. These accidents are very rare. Dislocation of Dislocation of the thumb at any of its joints is not unusual. The meta- the thumb, carpal bone may be displaced backwards or forwards from the trape- Of 08 magnum. Of pisiform.DISLOCATIONS OF THE THUMB. 349 zium, the former being the more common accident. Sir A. Cooper described a dislocation inwards, but gave no ease. Dr. P. Hamilton questions its occurrence. Reduction of these dislocations by extension and local pressure is usually readily effected, the bones being kept in position by means of a pad and a good splint extending some inches above and below the displaced bone. Dislocation of the first phalanx from the metacarpal hone is a recog- Dislocation of nised accident, the displacement backwards being the usual form, first^>halanx Dislocation fonoards is a rare one. The first form is usually the result metacarpal of a fall upon the distal end and palmar surface of the thumb, the bone, bead of the metacarpal bone projecting forwards, the base of the first phalanx backwards, and the extreme phalanx being flexed upon the first. The head of the metacarpal bone having probably been thrust forward through the capsule of the joint, and caught between the two beads of the flexor brevis muscle. In some cases, the reduction of this form of dislocation is effected Treatment with ease by simple extension, or, by the pressure of the surgeon’s of thumb upon the displaced phalanx, and for the purpose of extension Fio. 451. nothing equals in value the Indian toy called a “ puzzle,” or tube of plaited reed (Fig. 451). When this is not at hand, strips of strapping W] applied longitudinally to the distal digit and fixed by a circular piece difficulty in will answer the purpose. In some instances all these means fail, and reduction, there is yet much obscurity as to the cause of the difficulty. The numerous muscles and tendons that surround the joint doubtless have a powerful influence, more particularly the two heads of the short flexor with the sesamoid hones, and, when the wound in the capsule is small, these muscles act more powerfully, the base of the displaced hone or the head of the metacarpal bone being held by these parts “ as a button is fastened iuto a button hole.” Under these circumstances, success may at times be achieved by flexing the metacarpal bone of the thumb to an extreme degree, rotating, and then suddenly extending the displaced phalanges; this manoeuvre, as it were, freeing the displaced hone from the many tendons and ligaments that surround the joint, and that doubtless, at times, interfere with its reduction. I succeeded by this method in one case where every other had failed. My friend, Mr. Sells of Guildford, informs me that he has with facility reduced several dis- locations of this form by forcibly bending the thumb back, so as to tilt the base of the phalanx over the head of the flexed metacarpal bone and then extending it. Both these means have the effect of relaxing the short flexor muscle as pointed out by Prof. Fahbri. When all such means as have been mentioned have been unsuccessfully tried, the subcutaneous division of the tendons and ligaments that appear to350 DISLOCATIONS OP THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. Excision.

Causes. prevent reduction has been practised with variable success; and when this fails, excision of the part has been employed. In a case of this kind of six months’ standing, when the thumb was a useless member and the seat of pain, I excised the joint with excellent success, a moveable articulation being secured with hardly any deformity. When the bone is displaced forwards, it seems probable from the dissections of M. L. H. Farabeuf (Arch. Generates de Medicine, Sept.. 1876), that the extensor tendons of the thumb stretched on the inner or outer side of the metacarpal bone is the cause of the difficulty in its reduction, and, under such circumstances, forced flexion of the thumb upon the palm aided by manipulation is generally enough to replace it. Dislocation of the ungual phalanx of the thumb may take place in either direction, forwards or backwards, the last being the more com- mon, and the displaced bone being so small, difficulty is often felt in Pig. 452. applying extension to it. The puzzle (Fig. 451) is the best thing to employ for the purpose, or Levis’s apparatus (Fig. 452). At times, pressure with the thumb upon the displaced bone or forcible flexion will succeed. Hamilton pithily advises “ forced dorsal flexion in the case of the backward luxation, and forced palmar flexion in the case of the forward dislocation ” (p. 634, ed. 3). Dislocation of the phalanges of the fingers like those of the thumb, may occur in two directions, the backward being the more common. They are readily made out and easily reduced by extension, or flexion and then extension. DISLOCATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. Dislocations of the Hip. These are grave accidents and are found mostly in male adults, between 15 and 45 years of age, but occasionally in the young or old. Mr. Powdrell (‘ Lancet,’ 1868) has recorded a case in which the head of the femur was displaced into the foramen ovale at the age of six months, and reduced by manipulation, Erichsen has recorded another, of dislocation on the pubes, in a child a year and a half old. I have treated an instance of dislocation on the dorsum in a boy at. 6, and in a girl set ; but these are exceptions. On the other hand, they may occur in the aged, since Malgaigne has recorded five between the ages of 60 and 85, and I have treated one in a man aged 73, and in another aged 66 ; but at this time of life fracture of the neck of the femur is more common. The accident is always the result of violence, no slight force being required to tear through the ligaments that hold and bind the head of the femur in its deep pelvic cup; indeed were it not for the greatDISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. 351 leverage of the lower extremity, the accident would probably be a rarity. In exceptional instances, however, the bone is displaced with the slightest force. I have had a young man under my care whose femur had been dislocated a dozen times or more, the smallest twist in the limb causing its dislocation backwards. Congenital dislocations and displacements from disease are not in- cluded in this group. Dislocations from accident are of various forms, but. the division varieties of made by Sir A. Cooper is, doubtless, practically the best, if we remem- dislocation of klD. Fig. 453. Fig. 453a. Fig. 453.—Recent case of dorsal disloca- Fig. 453a.—Rent in capsule, with tion. femur flexed. From Mr. Morris’s paper. ber that varieties of each form or partial dislocations, are met with in practice; since there is good reason to believe that the head of the thigh-bone may rest at any point round its socket. 1. Dislocation upwards and backioards, on the dorsum ilii is the most common. 2. Dislocation backwards, towards the ischiatic or sciatic notch—a variety of the latter—stands third on the list as to frequency. 3. Dislocation downwards and inwards, into the foramen ovale stands second. 4. Dislocation upwards and forwards, upon the pubes, is about equal in frequency to that towards the sciatic notch. These several forms of dislocation depend much upon the degree How formed, of flexion or extension, and of inward or outward rotation of the thigh at the time of luxation. The head of the femur under most if not all circumstances, as demonstrated by Mr. Henry Morris in an able paper (‘ Med. Chir. Trans.,’ 1877), leaves the acetabulum, when the •» lower extremity is aiducted, through a rent in the capsular ligament where it is the thinnest, viz. at the inner and lower side of the joint (Fig. 453a), the strong ilio and ischio-femoral ligaments situated on the anterior, outer and posterior aspects of the joint and the shape of the acetabulum preventing displacement in any other position. With the limb abducted, however, the head of the femur is more than half out of the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres is quite loose and all the strong portion of the capsule is relaxed. Indeed Mr. Morris believes, that it is only in adduction of the lower extremity that a simple dislocation of the ead of the femur can possibly occur, and that a dislocation on to theDISLOCATIONS OP THE HIP-JOINT. 352 Condition of round ligament.

Also that the degree of flexion and rotation of the limb inwards determines in any particular instance whether the dislocation shall be dorsal or ischiatic, the latter variety occurring when flexion is carried to an extreme. Direct dorsal dislocation can only be produced by immense violence and is often complicated with fracture of the acetabulum. In all cases, the round ligament and capsule are torn across, the muscles about the joint being more or less lacerated. The following analysis shows many of these points:— Out of 54 consecutive cases which have occur- red at Guy’s and in my own practice, 27 were on the dorsum, 12 into the foramen ovale, 8 into the sciatic notch, and 7 on the os pubis. Eleven occurred in subjects under 20 years of age, the youngest being 6; and 28 between the ages of 21 and 40; while 15 had passed that period. Forty-six were in the male, and 8 in the female sex. Dislocation on the dorsum ilii, or backwards and upwards, forms about half of all the cases of dislocation at this joint, and is usually produced by some twisting movement of the body or limb Dislocation backwards, on the dorsum. Drawing 305.DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. 353 when the latter is abducted, or from a crushing weight received when in a stooping posture. It can he recognised by the following signs, viz. the flexed position of the thigh, the knee when the patient stands projecting in front of but above the other ; the rotation inwards of the Characters, limb, the great toe resting on the instep of the opposite foot; the projection of the great trochanter and its approximation to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium; the elevation of the fold of the buttock ; the immobility of the limb, and the pain pro- duced by any attempt to abduct or to extend it; and the marked shortening of the limb from an inch and a half to two and a half inches (Fig. 456). In thin subjects, the head of the bone may be felt lying upon the dorsum ilii, and in all there will be an unnatural fulness of this part. Slight flexion and adduction will usually be borne, while patients may support the weight of the body on the injured limb, or even walk upon it. Fig. 457. Fig. 467a. Fig. 4574.

It is characterised by the n°tCh' same though less marked symptoms. There is less shortening, but if the patient be placed upon his back and the thigh be flexed upon the trunk at a right angle, then the knee of the dislocated limb will sink below tliat of the other side from one to two inches (Figs. 457« 457J) the trochanter is drawn up and rotated forwards, hut not to the same extent; and the head of the bone cannot be felt. To the eye, the limb Character assumes much the same position as in the last form, but there bein^ less shortening the toes rest on the ball of the great toe of the opposite limb instead of on the instep vFtg. 457). Bigelow believes that this form of dislocation is due to the protrusion of the head of the bone below the VOL. II. 23354 DISLOCATIONS OP THE HIP-JOINT. Dislocation into the foramen ovale. Characters tendon of the obturator internus muscle; whereas, in the former bind the hone is protruded above the tendon. In this, however, he is wrong, as Mr. Morris has shown that the head of the femur in all forms of dislocation makes its exit from the acetabulum below this tendon. Dislocation upon I'10- 458. the foramen ovale or obturator fora- men is a very striking accident. Sedillot, as well as Boyer, believe that it is the most common of all forms, but Brit- ish and American surgeons usually place it third on the list. In my own table it stands second. It is ge- nerally caused by some forced ab- duction of the knee or foot, the head of the bone being tilted in- wards. In the case from which Fig. 458 was taken, it was caused by abduction of the knee, when the girl (set. 14) was stepping out of an omnibus. It is cliarac- Pxg. 469.

The patient at times can, however, walk with such an injury. Dislocation upon the os pubis is the least common form of disloca- Dislocation tion, and is due to forced extension and rotation outwards of the thigh, after dislocation by abduction, the pelvis being thrown forwards and the body bent backwards as the head of the femur is wrenched out of the socket and then drawn upwards. It is marked by eversion of the limb and foot and abduction ; rota- Characters tion backwards of the trochanter, and consequent flattening of this region. The head of the bone can usually also be felt, if not seen, as a projection upon the os pubis (Fig. 460) or on some part of the lip of the acetabulum. When thrown above the bone beneath Poupart’s ligament, it forms a very prominent projection beneath or to the outer side of the femoral artery (Fig. 461). When the head of the bone is thrown between the anterior ilium, or between the inferior superior and inferior spines of the spine and the acetabulum, the head position. Diagnosis.—With reasonable care symptoms which characterise the different forms of dislocation, these dislocations of the hone will be felt in that and attention to the special Diagnosis of Fig. 461. ought readily to be made out, although cer- of up- tain fractures about the neck of the femur may present others somewhat similar. I have seen two cases of impacted frac- ture of the neck of the thigh-bone with the foot inverted and the thigh flexed, presenting symptoms so similar to those of dislocation into the sciatic notch, that the diagnosis could not be made out till the pa- tients were brought under the influence of chloroform, when, by gentle manipulation, the nature of the accident was discovered; the greater freedom with which the head of the hone could he made to rotate in the acetabu- lum, and the limp condition of the limb under chloroform in the case of fracture, forming a marked contrast to the immobility and permanent position of the thigh in dis- location. The late Mr. It. W. Smith (on ‘ Fracture,’ 1850) records also a case of fracture of the neck of the femur which had been mistaken for dislocation. When in the adult the displacement recurs, after the apparent reduction of the bone and the extending force has been removed, the probabilities are, that the lip of the acetabulum has been broken off, Acetabulum or the head of the femur fractured (vide Birkett, ‘ Med.-Chir. Trans ’maybe vol. hi); and, when in a child, the displacement of the head of the bone cUip),ed- or upper epiphysis should be suspected; it being quite impossible under both these circumstances, to maintain the bone in position except by means of a long splint or weight to keep up extension In all cases of a doubtful nature, chloroform should be given for purposes Dislocatioa upon os pubis.

In ilio-sciatic dislocations. of diagnosis, the surgeon using the gentlest manipulation. The sudden loss of mobility, the rigidity of the limb, the absence of crepitus and other symptoms of fracture, with the positive signs of the injuries themselves, are sufficient to indicate the nature of the case. Nelaton’s test for dislocation of the hip backwards is, however, excel- lent, and consists of a line drawn from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the most prominent part of the tuberosity of the ischium. In a normal joint, the trochanter, in every position of the limb, merely touches the lower border of this line; but in all dislocations where the bone goes backward, it is found sometimes an inch above it. Treatment.—Sir A. Cooper, with the surgeons of his day, con- sidered the muscles about a joint as the chief agents in drawing a displaced bone into its abnormal position, and as forming the main obstacle to its reduction; and, as a consequence, they relied upon phy- sical force in the form of pulleys and other complicated appliances, as the chief means by which this obstacle could be neutralised. The modern surgeon with anaesthetics in his hands knows, that the mus- cular system has usually little or nothing to do with the difficulties that are met with in the reduction of a dislocation, and that these are found in the ligaments and capsule, a large laceration in the latter allowing easy reduction, when with a small difficulties must be experienced. With chloroform, therefore, all pulleys and mechanical appliances can be done away with—certainly in recent cases, and probably in old cases. In my own opinion they are never required, for adhesions are more readily broken down by forced flexion and rotation than by simple extension, and if these fail, no extending force will succeed. In dislo- cations of the hip, the reduction by flexion becomes, therefore, a reality, and is one of the greatest improvements in modern surgery. Fig. 462. Fig. 463. Reduction by manipulation.

In dislocation into tbe foramen ovale the reduction by flexion is likewise good, with subsequent circumflexion inwards, and extension (Pig. 462). In sub-pubic dislocations, tbe reduction by extension outwards and rotation is preferable. To carry out this reduction by flexion and manipulation, the patient should be placed on bis back on a hard couch and thoroughly anaesthe- ticised. The surgeon should then grasp the ankle of the displaced limb with one hand, and the ham with the other, flexing the leg upon the thigh, and the thigh upon the pelvis, at the same time liftingr the limb and adducting it towards the opposite side of the umbilicus. Having effected this movement, the surgeon should, by a semicircular sweep outwards, suddenly extend the limb and bring it into a straight line with the body (Fig. 463). If one attempt fail, a second may be made, and in by far the majority of recent cases success will attend the effort. “ If there is any single and best rule for reducing a recent dislocation of the hip,” writes Bigelow (‘ Lancet,’ June 15th, 1878), “it is to get the head of the femur directly below tbe socket by flexing the thigh at about a right angle, and then to lift or jerk it forcibly up into its place. This rule applies to all dislocations except the pubic. Flex and forcibly lift, and if this fail, flex and lift while abducting.” No roughness should be used, gentle, well-directed manipulation being all that is called for, the leverage obtained through the femur being enormous. Some slight rotation of the limb outwards or inwards, according to the necessities of the case, at times facilitates reduction. Callender insists (‘ Lancet,’ 1868), and I think wisely, upon the im- portance of not fully abducting or rolling the limb outwards, as, if this be done, the head of the bone is almost certain to roll past the acetabulum to its inner side; or, if an obturator dislocation is under treatment and the thigh rotated inwards, the head of the femur will roll round to the iscliiatic notch, just reversing the movement which takes place when an ischiatic dislocation is improperly manipulated. The object of the treatment is, to use the femur as a lever to raise the head of the bone from its backward position, and allow the stretched muscles to act naturally and draw it into place, the act of flexion com- pletely relaxing the strong ilio-femoral ligaments. The surgeon, with his knowledge of the way in which the head of the bone was driven through its capsule, using his best endeavours to make it retrace its steps, and employing his anatomical knowledge to press, elevate, or guide the malplaced bone into its normal position. The various move- ments adopted in reduction by manipulation, as well shown by Morris, serve to bring the head of the displaced femur down to the notch in the acetabulum by making it retrace the course it took in the process of dislocation, and then subsequently turning it back through the rent in the capsule by a rotation the reverse of that which occurred during dislocation. This method of reducing dislocations of the hip is known in France as I)epics’ method, in America as Reid’s. The former employed it in 1835 (vide Nelaton’s * Pathol. Chirurg.,’ 1847), but Dr. H. Bigelow has proved, that the credit of the method is really due to Nathan Smith, of New Hampshire (vide Memoirs, 1831).

In one case of severe injury to the joint that came under my care, where the bone was displaced on the dorsum, on attempting its reduction by manipulation the head of the bone slipped with such facility round the acetabulum as to illustrate every typical form of dislocation, and several intermediate or partial forms. In this case, however, reduction was subsequently readily obtained by thoroughly flexing the thigh upon the pelvis, and lifting the head of the femur from its false position by extension forwards. When the rent in the capsule is small, difficulties may he felt iu reduc- ing the dislocation, hut when large, little is usually experienced. At times reduction is thought to have been accomplished when re- dislocation appears after the limb has been left alone; and, under these circumstances, it is probable that the head of the hone had only par- tially been replaced through the rent in the capsule. In other cases of this kind which refuse to remain in sit'd, there is reason to believe that the lip of the acetabulum has been fractured, or, in young subjects, that the head of the femur has separated at the epiphysial line of junction with the neck. Still, without these explanations, cases are met with in which it is quite impossible to keep the limb in position after its re- duction. In exceptional cases, the reduction of the dislocation occurs when the patient is in bed, by some simple movement. I have seen several. When reduction by flexion has failed or is inapplicable, that by extension should be employed, and in the pubic form of dislocation, no other should be used. It should be practised with the patient under the influence of an anesthetic, and on his back, and as fol- lows :—The pelvis should be fixed by a perineal band well padded and adjusted, and the limb extended in the line of its position to draw the head of the bone out of its bed. The surgeon should then either ele- vate the bone to allow the muscles to act upon it, or abduct, adduct, or rotate inwards or outwards, according to the special want of the individual case. In some cases, the simple extension of the limb with the unbooted heel of the surgeon placed firmly in the perimeum will answer every purpose. After the reduction of a dislocation, the legs should be fastened to- gether, and no movement allowed for three weeks, and then only gentle movement, for if this rule be not attended to, re-dislocation may occur. In a case under my care of dislocation into the foramen ovale, in a young woman, after reduction had been effected, re-dislocation occurred on the tenth day, from crossing the leg over the opposite knee in attempting to cut the toe-nails of the affected limb. Splints are hardly called for in the majority of cases, although should secondary inflammation follow or much local mischief complicate the case, they should be applied, either with ice or hot fomentatious, the surgeon selecting the application that gives most relief. Old dislocations, in a general sense, should be left alone, since iu the hip, difficulties of reduction are always felt, and danger not rarely met with. During the first three weeks, reduction is rarely difficult, and may always be tried; indeed, within the month, good hopes attend the359 DISLOCATIONS OF THE PATELLA. attempt. Fergusson states that after three weeks, he has never seen a successful attempt. I have seen a dislocation on the dorsum reduced on the thirty-fifth day, with an excellent effect. Success has, however, been recorded in exceptional cases up to the sixth or eighth week, or even after six months, hut failure has more frequently followed the attempt. My colleague, Mr. Durham, in 1873, reduced one after the fifth month. Sir A. Cooper fixed eight weeks as the limit of time up to which the attempt should be made. When reduction has failed, good movement may often be secured after the lapse of time. The dangers Dangers of attending attempts at reduction are not theoretical. Inflammation and destruction of the joint are no infrequent consequences, and fracture old cases of the bone has been recorded by many surgeons. Dislocation of the knee or rupture of its ligaments has likewise taken place from the ex- tension employed, and with a fatal result. When fracture of the femur is associated with dislocation of the Dislocation lone, the latter should, when possible, be reduced by manipulation. In ^ femf™c,ure 1860,1 saw my colleague, Mr. Birkett, reduce with the greatest facility a dislocation of the head of the femur on the ramus of the pubis in a boy, set. 12, when the femur was broken below the trochanter, the bone slipping into place on the application of gentle, well-directed force. Similar cases have been recorded by Bloxam and M. Et&ne. When the reduction of the dislocation by these means has failed, some hope remains that when the fracture has united, a better success may be secured. Sir A. Cooper has related an example in which re- duction, by means of extension, was effected five weeks after the accident, in a youth about seventeen. Effects of dislocation.—The sciatic nerve may be injured at times Effects of in a dislocation of the hip, and as a consequence paralysis may ensue. „1fS|l1<’C!lt‘on Morris shows in his paper how this complication is caused, while Maclise in his illustrations gives a drawing illustrating how the nerve may be stretched, and Hutchinson (c Med. Times,’ 1866) a case in which the paralysis was permanent. Dislocations of the Patella. These are not common accidents, but when they occur are generally Dislocations caused by muscular action, and at times by the application of direct oftt*!j; force. They are most commonly met with outwards, occasionally p i e a‘ inwards, and very rarely edgeways. When the ligamentum patellae has been torn across, the patella is drawn upwards, and authors have described this accident as dislocation upwards. The dislocation ouitvards is usually seen in women in whom the Dislocation femora have a more oblique inward direction than in most men or in outwards, knock-kneed subjects, the bone resting on the outer condyle of the femur or on its outer edge ; in the former case the outer edge of the patella tilts forwards, and in the latter inner. The knee is usually slightly flexed; it looks broader and flatter, but the unnatural position of the cap marks the nature of the accident. In 1868,1 saw this acci- dent in a male child ten months old; the patella rested on the outer side of the condyle of the femur, and was readily reduced. Dislocation inwards is very rare, and easily recognised. It is al- Dislocation ways due to direct violence to the outer border of the bone. inwards. Both these accidents are attended with laceration of the synovial capsule.DISLOCATION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 360 Treatment of dislocation of the patella. Dislocation of the patella edgeways. Treatment thereof. Treatment.—Reduction is readily effected usually by raising the heel of the limb to relax the extensor muscles of the thigh, and manipu- lating the displaced bone into its position, the elevation of its depressed edge being generally enough to allow the muscles to restore it to its right place. A splint should then be applied, as well as a bag of ice for a few days till all inflammatory action has subsided, the knee being strapped up subsequently for a month or more, to give time for the ligaments to unite firmly. These dislocations, however, are very prone to recur on the slightest cause, and many patients are obliged to wear for life a firm leather knee-cap to guard against such a contingency. Dislocation of the bone edgeways is a very uncommon accident. I have seen only one such instance; and in it the patella appeared to show its articular facet inwards, its inner edge presenting forwards beneath the stretched skin. It was in a middle-aged woman, and produced by a direct blow upon the knee from a fall off a chair. Mayo has recorded an instance in which the bone had turned almost1 round. This dislocation is readily known by the peculiar aspect of the joint. Treatment.—In my own case, reduction was effected with ease on raising the leg and turning the patella into its right position with the fingers. Flower only succeeded on bending the knee, after chloroform had been given. Cases have been recorded where reduction was impos- sible, even after the subcutaneous division of the tendon and ligament that is attached to it and other rough means, but these were employed before chloroform was introduced, which must be their excuse. Under an anaesthetic, it is probable, that by manipulation, the bone will usually be reduced, if not, it had better be left alone. Some sudden muscular effort might be of service. Dislocation of the Knee-joint. Varieties. Diagnosis. Dislocation of the Knee-joint. This accident can only occur from great violence, the ligaments that bind the bones together being very strong; yet it does occur, the tibia being displaced backwards,forwards, or laterally. These disloca- tions are found in every degree of completeness. When partial, no com- plication, as a rule, exists, and the lateral is usually of this nature; when complete, the soft part about the joint and the fibrous tissues within, are often so injured as to render it a great question whether the joint, or even the limb, can be saved. The backward and forward dislocations are usually of this kind. When the popliteal artery or vein is injured or ruptured, amputation of the limb may be called for, this necessity being rendered more than probable when the circulation through the vessels is not speedily restored after the reduction of the dislocation, or, when Fig. 464. Pal elltt JSxth condyle of femur Dislocation of the tibia and fibula forwards.DISLOCATION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 361 a swollen condition of the limb remains. These dislocations are readily Treatment, diagnosed by the peculiar deformity they display, and are easily reduced, by extension and the application of pressure, where pressure is needed. In the case from which Fig. 464 was taken, pulsation in the vessels was arrested, but it returned on the reduction of the dislocation, and recovery with complete movement of the joint was obtained. After the parts have been replaced in their normal position, splints should be adjusted and cold applied, for secondary inflammation is almost sure to follow. Compound dislocations of the knee are generally so serious as to Compound necessitate the removal of the joint. The attempt to save it should only dislocation of be made in exceptional cases—amputation or excision may be selected. nee‘ Dislocation of the head of the fibula is occasionally met with. I Dislocation have seen but three examples, one when dressing for the late Mr. ofh®"1 of Aston Key, and two since. It is generally caused by some violent adduction of the foot with abduction of the knee, the head of the fibula tearing through its ligamentous attachments and becoming displaced Diagnosis, outwards. The accident can be readily recognised by the projection of the bone. It should be treated by the application of a pad and pres- sure over the part, sufficient to keep the bone in its place, the limb being flexed when necessary, to relax the biceps femoris. The pressure should be maintained for at least two months if good success is to be looked for; as a rule, the bone never quite resumes its former position, the head projecting more than usual. This deformity, however, does not appear to weaken the limb to any great extent. Dislocation of the interarticular fibro-cartilages (semilunar) is a Dislocation recognised accident. It is produced by some sudden twist of the knee of ,llc with the foot everted, and generally in subjects who have relaxed int®rarjicular joints, or such as have been the seat of some chronic synovitis. 8 The inner cartilage seems more liable to displacement than the outer. The symptoms of the accident are well marked. A patient when Symptoms, walking, accidentally catches his foot against a stone, or in rising from a kneeling position is seized with a sudden, sharp, sickening pain in the knee; the joint becomes at once fixed in a semi-flexed position, and any attempt to move it excites some pain. When the first agony has subsided, a painful spot is usually left, and there the projecting cartilage may be felt or even seen, and, if the “ internal derangement of the joint,'” as it was originally called, is left untreated, synovitis or effusion into the joint will soon show itself. When these symptoms follow such an accident as has been described, the cartilage has pro- bably been torn from its attachment to the tibia and been doubled in or displaced. Treatment.—1The best practice consists in the forced flexion of the Treatment joint, the slight rotation of the leg outwards, and sudden extension, thereof. When success attends this manoeuvre, the joint moves smoothly and without pain, and the patient will at once be able to move the joint freely. At times, the reduction of the displaced cartilage is attended with a decided snap. After its reduction, the joint should be kept in a splint, and such means employed as the symptoms that follow indicate, for more or less inflammation often ensues, requiring ice, cold lotions', leeching, and rest. When these have also subsided it is well to restrain the movements of the joint by means of a knee-cap or strapping, as a362 DISLOCATIONS OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. Results. Dislocation of the ankle. Varieties. Dislocation of foot outwards —Pott’s fracture. Causes. Character. Dislocation of foot inwards. Character. recurrence of the accident is liable to follow upon the least occasion. I have on several occasions thought, that disease has been excited when this measure has been omitted, and I once saw anchylosis follow. Per- manent lameness is by no means uncommon. When the surgeon fails to reduce the displaced cartilage, the patient at times suddenly gains relief by its self-production during some accidental movement. In other cases the cartilage reassumes its normal position more slowly. In 1873, I saw a case of this kind where this always occurred after its displacement. It was in a gentleman, aet. 30, and the inner cartilage projected beyond the head of the tibia in a most marked manner. The patient, therefore, should be kept in bed, and only allowed to move the limb, but not to stand upon it. When this result is not secured, the joint should be strapped up to restrain movement. Dislocations of the Ankle-joint. Such an accident uncomplicated with fracture is rare—that is, dislocation of the foot outwards is generally associated with frac- ture of the fibula; and dislocation inwards, with fracture of the tibia; or both malleoli may be broken. Pure dislocations of the foot forwards or baclcioards, however, may occur. These dislocations are given in the order of their frequency, and are usually produced by some violent twist or bending of the foot when the patient is jumping, or by some violent impulse of the body, with the foot fixed. Dislocation of the foot outwards is better known as Pott’s fracture (Pig. 465), the fibula being usually broken two or three inches above the external malleolus. It is caused by a violent bending of the foot outwards with the foot everted, its outer edge being raised and the inner turned downwards on the ground. At times, the extremity of the inner malleolus is broken off and displaced outwards, with the foot and astragalus. Under all circumstances, the lower end of the tibia or inner malleolus forms a prominent projection inwards, leading or misleading Sir A. Cooper and his copyists to describe this accident as dislocation of the tibia inwards. At the seat of fracture of the fibula, a depression exists. When the force is continued beyond the point necessary to cause the displacement mentioned, the lower end of the tibia may be made to project through the soft parts, and thus give rise to a compound dislocation. Iu still more severe cases, the extre- mities of both tibia and fibula may be made to project, the foot being completely turned outwards. Exceptional cases occur in which the foot is turned out of its socket between the malleoli, without any accom- panying fracture. Dislocation of the foot inwards (Fig. 466) is the counterpart of the last-described accident, and is caused by violence that turns the foot in- wards, with its outer edge to the ground. It is usually associated with an oblique fracture of the inner malleolus and displacement. The force required to produce this dislocation is very great, the tibia being a far stronger bone than the fibula, and consequently is less common. The end of the fibula is often fractured and drawn outwards with the astragalus. At times the astragalus is also fractured. The accident is known by the inversion of the foot, the sole looking inwards, and by the projection of the external malleolus, this prominent symptom having led Sir A. Cooper to describe it as dislocation of the tibia out- wards.DISLOCATIONS OP THE ANKLE-JOINT. 363 When the force is continued or more severe, the fibula may be made to project through an external wound; and in still more severe cases, the fractured or rather exposed ends of both tibia and fibula. I have Fig. 465. Fig. 466. External appearances of foot in Pott’s fracture. Taken from Pott’s work. A. P. Cooper.

I simply reduced the dislocation after washing the wound, and fixed it in splints. Dislocation of the foot backwards (Fig. 467). Sir A. Cooper called this Dislocation dislocation of the tibia and fibula for- wards. It is usually caused by the violent propulsion of the lower end of the leg bones forwards, when the foot is fixed, and is readily recognised by the shortening of the anterior surface of the foot and the proportionate elonga- tion of the heel, with some pointing of the toes, as well as prominence of the lower end of the tibia. At times, the fibula is fractured and the point of bone carried backwards with the astra- galus. This accident is rare, it being more common to meet with fracture of both malleoli, and displacement of the foot and broken fragments back- wards. In 1862,1 was called to treat a very marked case of this kind in a man, set. 32. The astragalus with the foot seemed to have been shot completely out of its socket, and the extremities of foot Fig. 467. backwards.

Splints, &c. Treatment of compound dislocation of ankle. When resection necessary. of the tibia and fibula projected so far forward as almost to rupture the soft parts covering them. The accident was caused by wrest- ling. The dislocation was reduced by flexing the leg on the thigh and by manipulation; but no means could he found to maintain the hones in position till the tendo Achillis was divided and the leg placed on its side and fixed on an outside splint. Mr. Cock (‘ Guy’s Rep.,’ 1855) has recorded a case of the same accident in a boy, set. 16, where the same difficulty was experienced. He divided the tendo Achillis and bound the foot in splints, and a good result was obtained. Dislocation of the foot forwards is probably more rare than the last, and is generally only partial. It has been described as dislocation of the tibia backwards, and is known by precisely the opposite symptoms to those last described. The heel is shortened and the foot lengthened, the upper surface of the astragalus being capable of recognition by the fingers. Poland records such a case (‘ Guy’s Rep.,’ 1855), in which the whole foot was much elongated and the posterior part of the astragalus caught in the anterior part of the tibia and fibula and wedged in tightly. Reduction was only effected after the division of the tendo Achillis. Treatment.—The lateral displacements of the foot are not difficult of reduction by extension and well-directed manipulative force. The flexion of the knee facilitates this operation by relaxing the muscles of the calf. To keep the bones in position, a Macintyre or flat posterior splint extending up to the popliteal space, with foot-piece and two side splints all well padded, are sufficient, as a rule, the surgeon using his judgment as to the amount of pressure and padding that may be demanded. In some cases where it is a very difficult matter to keep the parts quiet from the action of the gastrocnemii muscles, the tendo Achillis should be divided, the foot, after this simple operation, being perfectly passive, and entirely in the hands of the surgeon to place and to keep in any required position. The limb should subsequently be slung in a proper swing, Salter’s being the best. In hospital practice, two or more pieces of bandage slinging the splints to the cradle answer well. In the displacement of the foot forward or backward the same kind of treatment is appli- cable ; but in these accidents, it is expedient, as a rule, to divide the tendo Achillis at once. This should be done at any rate when the slightest disposition to displacement is found to exist, the treatment of the case being by this operation rendered more simple and certain. The splints should be retained for at least six weeks, and afterwards passive movement allowed. The patient should not bear any weight on the limb for another month. The treatment of compound dislocation of the ankle-joint cannot be reduced to any definite rules. Each case must be treated on its own merits. In young and healthy subjects, more may be attempted in the way of saving the joint than in the old or cachectic. When a small wound exists, operative interference is only exceptionally needed; but when a large one with projection of the bones, it is a question whether the better practice lies in the reduction of the dislocation after cleans- ing the projecting bones, or in their resection. When the bones cannot be reduced by ordinary force, their resection becomes a necessity.365 DISLOCATIONS OF THE FOOT. When the hones are much crushed, their resection should always be undertaken; indeed, it is a general feeling in my own mind, that in compound dislocations, as in compound fractures with a large wound, it is wiser to resect the ends of the projecting bones than to reduce them. Amputation of the foot should only be performed when the When soft parts and bones are much injured, and the age of the patient or “™P“ta,lon his want of power forbids the hope that a recovery with a useful preferred. limb can be secured. Before any attempt at reduction is made, the parts should be thoroughly cleansed. After the reduction of the dislo- After- cation whether simple or compound, the application of ice in a bag is of great value, or the treatment by irrigation. In the suppurative dislocation of stage, the latter practice is probably the better of the two. When the ankle, wound is only of a limited nature, it may be sealed at once either by lint soaked in blood, or, what is better, by the compound tincture of benzoin. Report speaks strongly in favour of washing out the joint in such cases with a weak solution of carbolic acid (1 part in 40), and then sealing the wound. Opposite the wound, an interrupted splint should be employed. Secondary amputation may be called for in these cases, on account of gangrene or a failure in nature’s efforts to effect repair, &c. Dislocation of the tibia and fibula at their lower articulation, with Dislocation a forcing of the astragalus upwards between the two bones, is an acci- °/eta^',falus dent which must be recognised (Fig. 468), and is usually produced by tibia and a jump from a height on the foot or feet. I saw a good example of fibula, it in 1869, in both feet of a man, set. 55, who fell from a scaffold. The malleoli were widely separated and projected, the depth of the foot from the ex- tremites of the malleoli was lessened, and the movements of the foot almost gone. No frac- ture could be made out. It was impossible to move the bones from the position in which they were wedged, although all means were used. Yet a good recovery took place, though with stiff joints. Sir W. Fergusson describes this accident, and gives a case. Dislocations at the tarsal joints are met with in practice, although but rarely. They are diffi- cult to diagnose, and still more to classify, since they are so variously described by different writers. The first to be noticed is the dislocation of the foot from the astragalus, which maintains its normal position between the malleoli. The pos- sibility of such an accident was doubted, till Mr. Dislocation of ankle. Pollock, in 1859 (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xlii) ,bet"pcel) n > tibia ana fibula. Cast published two cases. One occurred m Mr. 160, Guy’s Mus. Keate’s practice in 1823. The os calcis and scaphoid with the other foot bones were displaced outwards off the astragalus, and, in the other which occurred in his own practice, the same bones were dislocated inwards. A dissection of this case is* giveu. In the former instance the foot was everted and the head of the astragalus projected on the inner side of the instep. In the other, the foot was inverted, so that the sole turned inwards as inDISLOCATIONS OF THE FOOT. 366 Division of tendo A chillis may he required. Examples of sub- astragaloid dislocation. varus; the external malleolus was very prominent, and the astragalus projected on the other side. In some instances the surfaces of the foot are maintained in their right line. In Mr. Pollock’s case, reduc- tion was found to be impossible till the tendo Achillis had been divided when it was readily accomplished. In an able paper, he advocates this practice whenever difficulty of reduction of the inward or outward dislocation, simple or compound, is experienced, and shows that the division of the posterior tibial tendon is occasionally called for in the outward. Mr. Turner, of Manchester, had previously advo- cated the same practice (‘ Trans. Prov. Med. and Surg. Assoc.,’ vol. ix). An admirable paper on this subject has been published by Mr. Mac Cormac (‘St.Thos.Hosp. Rep.,’ 1872). The woodcut produced (Fig. 469) is taken from it, and in the case from which it was taken “ the foot was violently inverted and adducted, its position being like that of talipes varus. The sole of the foot looked inwards and was nearly vertical, the outer edge of the foot, with the patient erect, would rest partially upon the ground. The great toe pointed towards the arch of the opposite foot. The inner border of the foot was some- what shortened and more concave, while the outer was more convex than natural, and appeared as if lengthened. The outer malleolus was very prominent, while the inner could not be perceived, so deeply was it buried. Neither malleolus was fractured, and this would seem to be almost characteristic of this form of injury.” “The rounded head of the astragalus, completely dislodged from the scaphoid, was resting subcutaneously over the cal- caneocuboid articulation. The prominence caused by the head was somewhat masked by swelling of the soft part just below it* The skin covering the head was so tensely stretched that it seemed ready to burst, and a circular slough subsequently formed at the spot. The outline of the head could, however, be easily traced, and the finger, on being passed upwards beneath the external malleolus, readily felt the cartilaginous sur- face of the large posterior articulating facet of the astragalus. Most of it was quite subcutaneous, and its external margin ren- dered the skin very tense. The inter- osseous ligament had been ruptured. The tuberosity of the scaphoid stood out promi- nently, and a depression could be felt behind it. The motions of the foot were very limited.” Macdonnell, of Dublin (‘Dub. Journ.,’ 1839), published a case in which the same bones were displaced backwards, ■where the heel pro- jected, and a marked prominence existed on the dorsum of the foot, with an abrupt descent in front on the tarsus. M. Parise (‘ Annales de la Chirurg.,’ 1845) gives an instance which is apparently unique, of dislocation forwards, in which marked elongation of the foot existed and the projection of the heel was effaced. All these dislocations are rare. The first example of dislocation in- wards that I have seen was recorded by Mr. Cock, in ‘ Guy’s Hosp. Fig. 469. off the astragalus. After W. Mac Cormac.DISLOCATIONS OF THE FOOT. 367 Rep./ for 1855, with a drawing; but in my work on the ‘ Joints/ 1859, 1 published (Case 85) an example of dislocation of the foot outwards, with a description of the dissected extremity, which had occurred in the practice of Mr. Aston Key, in 1845. The foot was amputated, reduction being impossible. The ankle-joint was perfect. The os calcis with the foot was displaced outwards. The tendon of the tibialis posticus was found in front of the tibia holding down the astragalus. The posterior tibial nerve was violently stretched over the astragalus. The limb was removed for tetanus, the symptoms immediately disappearing after the amputation. A large number of Dislocation these cases are compound; and in some they are complicated , with fracture of the fibula. Broca (‘ Mem. de la Societe de Chirurg./ tome iii), out of 13 examples of dislocation outwards, gives 9 as compound. This dislocation may he diagnosed from displacement at the ankle- joint and dislocation of the astragalus itself by the fact, that extension and flexion are present; from fractures about the ankle, by the absence of crepitus, together with the positive signs of the injuries them- selves. Treatment.—Reduction should only be attempted with the patient Treatment of anaBstheticised, and, under such an influence, by extension and manipu- dislocation, lation success may he looked for. When difficulties are experienced Turner and Pollock’s suggestion of dividing the tendo Acliillis, and even the posterior tibial tendon, or any other tendon, when it is clearly interfering with the replacement of the bones, should he followed. When these means fail and the stretched skin gives way, the case must be treated as one of a compound nature, and the astragalus excised, the foot being subsequently well confined in splints and ice applied. Occasionally amputation may be demanded, or Syme or Pirogoff’s more partial operation. Dislocations of the astragalus alone are said to be more common than Dislocation the former accidents. 1 have seen several such, although afterof tlie reading Mac Cormac’s essay I am disposed to think I have mistaken „)'o™esalus some cases of subastragaloid dislocation for dislocation of the astra- galus. Pollock believes the pure dislocation of the astragalus to be very rare. The hone may be shot out of its socket forwards, backwards and Varieties, even laterally, and, in rarer examples, rotated on its axis. In the dislocation forwards, the head of the bone projects from Dislocation between the malleoli; in some being shot inwards so as to form forwards, a marked eminence beneath the internal malleolus, in others outwards. In such an accident, the heel remains in its normal position, and all movement of the ankle-joint is lost. The dislocation backwards, of which Phillips (‘Med. Gaz./ 1834) Dislocation and Turner have cited examples, is indicated by the remarkable pro- backwards, jectiou which suddenly appears above the heel, pressing out the tendo Acliillis, by the shortening of the foot, and the prominence of the tibia in front. Dislocation of the astragalus laterally to be complete must he com- Lateral pound (Fig. 470), and when incomplete at first, will probably become dislocation of complete at a later period through slougliiug of the soft parts. It is astraBalus- i generally, but not always, complicated with fracture of one or other of the malleoli. Boyer has recorded a case of dislocation of the astragalusDislocation of astragalus inwards.

Compound dislocation of the astragalus. complication existed, and in ‘Gu\’s recorded an example of dislocation of the bones outwards in a man set. 51, in which both mal- leoli were entire; the astra- galus had been fractured and turned completely out of its bed, and was found hanging to the wound below the external malleolus. I removed the broken frag- ments at once, and brought the foot into a good position, a complete recovery with a stiff joint ensued. At the present time, sixteen years after the accident, the man walks about without the aid of a stick, and with no other incon- venience than that occasioned by a stiff joint, which be maintains is a very slight matter. Some rotation of the bone often co-exists. Fig. 471 illustrates a case of dislocation of the bone outwards, complicated with fracture of the fibula. Treatment.—In simple dislocation of the astragalus when the bone can be replaced by manipulation, nothing more is needed; but such a result caunot always be secured. When it cannot, even under chloroform, the tendo Achillis should be divided. Iu 1862 I was called to see a man, set. 28, who had fallen on his feet from a height of four yards, whose right astragalus was shot forward completely out of its socket, and nearly burst through the skin. In this case chloroform had been given, and every kind of manipulation and extension employed by com- petent men to reduce the bone, without effect. I divided the tendo Achillis, extended the foot fully, and applied gentle pressure to the pro- jecting astragalus, when the bone slipped back readily into its place. Some crepitus was felt, however, and, I believe a horizontal fracture of the astragalus co-existed, the upper surface and head of the bone having been displaced forwards. The foot was fixed on side splints, and a good recovery ensued with a moveable joint. When the displaced boue cannot be restored to its normal position directly after the acci- dent, it is now fairly a settled question that it should not be removed till after the tissues have sloughed. Sir A. Cooper strongly advo- cated this practice, and Broca has since supported him, showing by an analysis of cases, that in 36 examples of irreducible simple luxation in which the bone was removed at once, one fourth were fatal; while in 43 in which the bone was left alone, only 2 deaths took place, Fig. 471.

In all compound dislocations of the astragalus, the removal of the in compound hone should always be effected. dislocation oi Dislocations of the other tarsal bones have been recorded, aswagams. Malgaigne relates two cases of dislocation of the calcis outwards, the 01-'^|otHer hone forming a projection beneath the external malleolus and beyond larga; bones, the cuboid articulation. In 1865, I saw a case of Mr. Birkett s, at Guy’s, in which the left scaphoid hone was displaced inwards and formed a very marked projection. It was readily reduced by pressure under chloroform, at a moment when the distal end of the foot was drawn outwards. I have the notes also of a case of dislocation of the internal cuneiform bone upwards with the metatarsal bone of the Dislocation of great toe, in a man set. 24; of a second, in a man ast. 30, in which the the internal same hones were displaced inwards, the accident having been pro- cuneiform, duced by a weight falling on the outer ankle when the foot was rest- ing on the great toe. In both, reduction was readily effected with a good result. Holthouse informs us that the internal cuneiform hone may be sepa- rated from all its articulations, and thrown upwards and inwards. The three cuneiform hones are also sometimes luxated together upwards, and without much difficulty may he reduced by pressure. The scaphoid and cuboid bones may also be displaced. Malgaigne Dislocation of has described this accident as a middle tarsal dislocation; Liston has the scaphoid described it in his ‘ Practical Surgery;’ and Sir A. Cooper in his work a" cu 01 4 On Dislocations.’ Dislocations of the metatarsal hones may likewise occur. In 1854, I Dislocation o£ saw a case recorded by Mr. Cock (‘ Guy’s Rep.,’ 1855), in which the atarsai entire metatarsus appeared to have been separated from its attachment bones, to the cuneiform and cuboid bones and thrown on the dorsal surface of the instep, where their bases could he seen and felt. The internal cuneiform and navicular hones appeared to have been likewise injured. The injury was the result of a crush from the wheel of a railway waggon. All Mr. Cock’s efforts at reduction failed, but a good foot was secured, and the man subsequently returned to his work as a labourer on the railway. Dr. Hetzig (‘ Syden. Soc. Bien. Ret.,’ 1865-6), who gives us an analysis of 29 cases of these tarso-metatarsal dislocations, states, that 13 were of single bones, 16 of the entire metatarsus, some of these being lateral and others vertical, as in Cock’s case. In the former, greater inconvenience follows from a failure in reduc- tion. Dislocations of the phalanges are less common than those of the Dislocations finger, and chiefly occur upwards from direct violence to the ends °fthe of the toes, and, as a rule, are compound. The great toe is the Phalan&es- one usually injured, and, as in the thumb, considerable difficulty is at times met with in its reduction, the ligaments and many I tendons around the joint affording an explanation of this fact. Such a case should be treated in the same way as dislocation of the thumb. Reduction must always be effected, when possible, by extension tnd well-directed pressure; forced flexion or extension sometimes facilitates the process. VOL. II. 24Tn hip joint.

It has been the habit of authors to describe cases included under the above heading as examples of dislocation ; hut it is clearly more correct to regard them as malformations, for as met with in the shoulder, clavicle, wrist, and lower jaw, they are always associated with a want of development in the hones, and paralysis of the muscles of the part. When seen in the hip, there is likewise good reason to believe that congenital deficiencies are also present, as the anatomical facts which bear upon the point support this view; one such is given by Cruveil- hier in the second plate of the second volume of his ‘ Pathological Anatomy,5 where an engraving of a skeleton in which this congenital displacement existed, shows it to he the result of a want of depth, from incomplete formation, of the acetabulum; and another is furnished by a valuable preparation in the Middlesex Hospital Museum (Prep. 12, series 3), in which there is practically no acetabulum, hut a strong capsule and a well-developed head of the femur without a ligamentum teres. This congenital displacement of the hip is by no means an uncommon affection, and is often mistaken for hip or spinal disease, more particu- larly when one joint alone is implicated. It generally affects both joints, occurs in female rather than male children, and in those who are in all other respects well in health and perfect in form, and although it has been boldly asserted that “ it is beyond doubt that this dislocation is produced at birth through downward force applied to the thigh in endeavouring to hasten the birth in breech presentations,” no evidence has been published to support the view. On reviewing Fig 471. Fig. 471a. Case of displacement of both femora. Anterior view. Side view. my own experience, I must add that it does not in any way encourage such an opinion, for whilst in no case have I been able to learn thatCONGENITAL DISPLACEMENT OR DISLOCATION. 371 a breech birth took place, I heard in the majority that a natural birth occurred. The symptoms of the displacement are very marked, and in its Symptoms, double form are well shown in the foregoing drawings taken from life (Figs. 471, 471a), the most conspicuous being lordosis, a peculiar breadth of hips, rounding of the buttock, rotation of the whole ex- tremity and foot inwards, and slight flexion of the thigh—in fact, the symptoms of dorsal dislocation of the hips. The lordosis is produced in these cases in the same way as it is in the Lordosis; accidental dorsal dislocation, or the acquired displacement of the head how of the femur in hip disease, and can be effaced by elevation of the produced, limb, with the patient in the horizontal position as in those cases (Figs. 539, 541). The movements of the joint are good, at times perfect, and give rise to no pain. The head of the femur also rotates smoothly on the ilium. When one joint only is affected (Fig. 471b), there will be shortening of the limb for about an inch, and on comparing the affected with the sound side it will be at once seen that this shortening is in the thigh, and that the trochanter is drawn up to the level of the anterior superior spine of the ilium. The walk of a patient with a double displacement is very curious; it is a kind of “ roll,” not unlike that of a woman going up stairs who has some loosen- ing of her sacro-iliac joints or very broad hips. While a patient with a single affected joint limps and has an awkward gait, which has often led parents and others to suspect hip or spinal disease, more particularly when by over use of the malformed joint, pains are excited. Occasionally the muscles of the affected limb or limbs are weak, but this is met with in only exceptional cases. Treatment.—Nothing can be recommended with the view of cure, for art cannot supply a natural deficiency or make up for a defect of structure in the bones of the joint. Still, surgery can do much heaTofTeft'femur. towards the prevention of additional trouble by Posterior view, exercising the muscles of the limb and body without fatiguing them; forbidding excessive standing or walking during the years of growth, and attending to the general health. Mechanical appliances are to be condemned as useless, if not worse. They have been employed on a wrong principle, or rather on a want of due appreciation of the conditions of parts, and therefore with only a vague hope that they may do good. These observations apply as much to the use of an extension apparatus as to operative inter- ference, although with more force to the latter. Fig. 471b. When one joiut is affected. Peculiar walk. Treatment.372 ON FRACTURES. Definition. Varieties of fractures. CHAPTER XXXI. ON FRACTURES. When a bone is broken, it is said to be fractured; when the skin and soft parts covering in the broken bone are whole, the fracture is simple or subcutaneous; when a wound exists communicating with the broken bone, whether the wound be caused directly by the same force that produced the fracture or indirectly by the bone perforating the skin,, the fracture is compound. A simple or compound fracture is said to be complete when the solution of continuity is complete; incomplete, when the bone is only cracked, fissured, or bent, as in “ green-stick" fracture, where the bone is splintered on its convex surface and not on its concave; splintered, when only a portion of the bone is cut off either by a sabre wound, in machinery, or by some local injury chipping ofi' the edge of a bone; fissured, when the line of fracture extends partially or wholly through the bone and no separation of the frag- ments exist; impacted, when one end of the broken bone is driven into and fixed in the other. A bone may also be perforated by a gunshot or punctured wound. A complete fracture may be transverse, oblique, longitudinal, dentate, or comminuted; multiple of the same bones, or of contiguous bones, of separate or distinct bones (vide Fig. 472). All fractures may likewise Fig. 472. Transverse. A. Complete Fractuees. Dentated or Longitudinal. Comminuted. b. c. Oblique and Multiple.

A fracture may be met with at every period of life; indeed, it may Time of life, occur in utero from some external violence, and, when the accident has taken place some time antecedent to birth repair may have gone on to completion although in most cases with deformity, the vis medicatrix natures being, as Billroth well observes, a better physician than surgeon. I have seen this in an infant who was born with a humerus bent at right angles, evidently from a repaired intra- I’m. 473. uterine fracture. The fractures of infancy are comparatively rare, and are commonly incomplete or “green-stick.” Fig. 473 illustrates this in the cla- vicle, and Fig. 474 in the parietal bone. The latter was taken from a child, set. eight months, who was thrown out of a perambulator on the pave- Case of. ment. No symptoms of brain disturbance followed the accident at any time. The drawing was taken on the second day following the acci- dent. The case occurred in the practice of Mr. Harris, of South Hackney. In such cases as these, the depression in the bone may, as time passes, be gradually pressed out, but in others it is permanent.

They are commonly met with in the neck of the femur and the lower end of the radius, although they occur in the neck of the humerus, and other parts. Thus in Fig. 512 is illus- trated an impacted fracture of the shaft of the femur. Men are more ex- posed to fractures than women on account of their more constant liability to injury, and those bones suffer the most that are the most exposed to external violence, hence the frequency of fracture of the lower extremities.

Ormerod’s observations. Diseased bones are always predisposed to fracture from slight causes, more particularly the rickety and cancerous, and those that have atrophied from any cause, or are the subject of fragilitas and mollities ossium, and likewise bones that are weakened by the presence of tumours or some syphilitic or other inflammatory affection. In diseased or brittle bones muscular action may be enough to cause fracture. Thus, I have known a thigh to be fractured in turning in bed, in an epileptic attack, and in swinging it over the side of a cart; the humerus, in the act of hugging a wife; and in a man, set. 26, from throwing a stone; the clavicle, from lifting a heavy weight; the ribs, in coughing; the radius, from wringing clothes; and every sur- geon knows how frequently the patella and, more rarely, the olecranon are broken from muscular spasm. Mr. J. Anningson, of Burnley, has also recorded a case of a woman, set. 42, in which the upper three fourths of the tuberosity of the calcis was fracture, and displaced upwards by muscular action (‘ Brit. Med. Journ.,’ Jan. 26th, 1878). “ From a review of the observations made on the bones of two insane patients,” writes Dr. Ormerod (‘St. Bart. Hosp. Rep.,’ 1870), “it may fairly be inferred that the brittleness of the ribs depended on a morbid condition of the bones, and that this condition wms general, affecting different parts of the osseous system coincidently, though more marked in the ribs than in some other more compact bones. The process was essentially one of absorption of the internal structure of the bone, the osseous tissue being replaced by an excessive deposit of the fatty matters normally existing in its interior. Thus, the usually invisible membrane lining the Haversian canals, and forming the coats of the vessels lying there, was thickened into a membrane of cognisable struc- ture and dimensions. The space for this thickening was obtained by removal of the innermost concentric laminae; and from this point a change was propagated which resulted in or tended to the removal of each entire Haversian system. In the whole bone there was a loosening of the mutual connection of the laminae and an obscure disintegration of the osseous structure itself and a general infiltra- tion of oily matter into the substance which had intruded itself within the Haversian canals, and into whatever part of the compact structure of a bone could find room for it.” In confirmation of these views I may mention, that I have been attending with Dr. Black of Canonbury, a middle-aged lady, the sub- ject of dementia and epilepsy, who in nine or ten fits, none of them having been violent, broke a bone, and on several occasions two. The Fig. 475. Impacted fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone. Taken from a man, set. 64, who recovered from the accident.ON FRACTURES. 375 fractures took place when the patient was in bed by mere muscular action, and repaired well; indeed, as well as if the subject of them bad been quite healthy. The immediate cause of fracture is usually some direct violence Cause, applied to the part, or it may be indirect, the bone, under some bending force, giving way at its weakest point; “ in the line of extension, not that of compression—Teevan. Indirect fractures are, as a rule, of the simplest kind unless com- plicated with joint dislocation; when compound the soft parts are mostly injured by the protrusion of the fractured bone. Fractures the result of direct violence, are always the most severe, the same violence that breaks the bone injuring the soft parts over it, and often Assuring and comminuting it. The mode of production of a fracture is consequently a point of great practical importance, both for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The diagnosis of a fracture is usually easy, though in exceptional Diagnosis, cases it is difficult, if not impossible. It is easy, when, after a blow or fall attended by the sensation of When easy, something giving way, deformity is found, with inability to move the limb; and on manipulation, abnormal mobility of the injured limb exists, with crepitus from the rubbing of the broken fragments together; when pain attends any attempt at movement, and swelling rapidly follows the accident; and when shortening exists, which is remedied by extension. The diagnosis is difficult when, as in impacted fractures, abnormal When mobility and crepitus are absent, and slight but fixed deformity; local lliu‘cult- paiu and shortening are the only symptoms, and when the nature of the accident is the only guide. When a transverse fracture of such a bone as the tibia exists without displacement, and with no fracture of tbe fibula; when the fracture is into or in the neighbourhood of a joint, and there is much swelling of the injured part; and when a fracture and dislocation co-exist. It is always difficult and at times impossible to make out a simple fissure of a bone, cranial or otherwise ; and the same may be said of a fracture of the pelvis or thorax; such injuries as these can be made out only by the natural symptoms of fracture, as they are called, and by such as are referred to the contents of the cranial, thoracic, or pelvic cavities. When a bone is broken near a joint, aud effusion into it follows the injury, the surgeon should suspect the presence of a fissure of the bone into the articulation; and when a V -shaped fracture of the lower third of the tibia is present, the V occupying the internal or subcutaneous surface of the bone and not the crest (vide Fig. 527), this complication is to be looked for. It is sometimes difficult to diagnose a fracture from a separated epiphysis. When a fracture is transverse (Fig. 472, a), there may be no or only Deformity some slight lateral displacement; when oblique (Fig.472, d), there dependent will probably be some shortening of the limb from the drawing up of f^ctur'e the lower portion of the limb, or riding as it is called of one end over the other. At times, there will be rotation of the limb, and in commi- nuted fractures separation of the ends of the bone. (Fig. 472, c).ON FRACTURES. 376 Muscular action the cause of deformity. Sub- periosteal fracture. Crepitus. When uot to he looked for. Synovial crepitus. Caution. These points will be greatly determined by the character of the fracture, the bone that is involved, and the amount of muscular action that influences the fracture. In parallel and conjoined bones of which only one is broken, the de- formity that exists is likely to be less marked than where a single bone is broken; as, under these circumstances, the non-fractured bone tends to neutralise the action of the muscles through which deformity or contraction usually takes place, for muscular action is undoubtedly the main cause of deformity, tonic action of the muscles existing under all circumstances, and spasmodic action when they are irritated by frag- ments and attempts at reduction. Muscular spasm being the main cause of deformity and shorten- ing of the limb after fracture, it becomes an important point to recollect in its treatment that the peculiar deformity associated with any special form of fracture can be obviated by neutralising the action of the muscles that produce it. Thus, in fractures of the humerus above the insertion of the deltoid, the action of the latter muscle will be to draw the lower fragment up and outwards, while the pectoral muscle has a direct influence in drawing in the upper fragment. In fractures of the humerus below the insertion of the deltoid, the tendency of this muscle will be to draw the upper fragment outward, and the brachialis anticus has an equally powerful tendency to draw the lower half forward. In fractures of the thigh-bone below the minor tro- chanter, the psoas and iliacus muscles naturally draw the upper fragment forwards, and rotate it outward and, in fracture of the con- dyles, the gastrocnemii have a powerful tendency to draw the lower end backward. When a bone is fissured and not displaced, the periosteum not being divided, there will be little displacement, and in children this condition is often found. Crepitus, or the grating sensation caused by the rubbing of the ends of the broken bones together, is a most valuable sign of fracture, and when detected in making the examination of a limb supposed to be frac- tured, the diagnosis is made clear, but, when other symptoms of fracture sufficient for a diagnosis are present, it need not be looked for. In impacted fractures, as of the hip, it can only be felt on loosening the impacted fragments, and consequently by doing irremediable harm, this error is serious, and should be avoided. In incomplete fractures crepitus is also absent. In fact every fracture or suspected fracture should be manipulated with the utmost gentleness, in order that as little displacement and local injury may be inflicted as possible, for the bulk of fractures can be made out with certainty without crepitus. As a symptom, however, it is always of great value. The crepitus of effusion or of the thecae of tendons must not be mis- taken for that of a broken bone. It is a soft crepitus rather than a hard one, as in bone. Bursal crepitation is particularly liable to mislead. When some swelling follows immediately upon the accident, it means ruptured blood-vessels, arterial or venous. When it occurs within a few hours, it is due to inflammatory effusion. In all cases of supposed displacement, the normal condition of the limb must be inquired into, and the sound compared with the affected, for in more cases than one I have known a natural or old acquiredON FBACTUKES. 377 deformity in a limb mistaken for one caused by an accident, and attempts have been made to restore, or rather to reduce it to its sup- jn Prognosis in posed normal condition. , Prognosis.—Simple fractures, as a rule, do well. At Guy s, ... gjm-le six years, out of 469 cases of simple fracture of the thigh, 17 died, fracture, or 3'5 per cent.; of 888 examples of simple fracture of the leg, 8 died, or not 1 per cent.; of 123 cases of fractured patella there was no death. The same statistics inform us that one tenth of all cases of fracture of the thigh are compound, and as are also one fifth of all fractures of the leg. Compound fractures are always serious accidents, those of the upper In extremity being less fatal than those of the leg, and these less so than compound, those of the femur. Thus, at Guy’s, in six years, out of 94 cases of compound fractures of the arm and forearm, 16 or 17 per cent, died, or 1 in 6 cases; out of 202 cases of compound fracture of the leg, 56 or 27-7 per cent, died, or 1 in 4 cases; and out of 52 cases of com- pound fracture of the thigh, 19 or 365 per cent, died, or 1 in 3—the mortality increasing by 10 per cent, in each group. These statistics however, hut roughly indicate the risks of the different accidents, as they include smashes of limbs with the compound fractures. As a cause of death after fracture of the long hones, Professor Fat Czorny, of Freiburg, has proved in an able paper (‘ Berliner Klinische embolism. Wochenschrift,’ Nos. 44 and 45), that “fat embolism” is to he taken into account; the fluid fat of the bones being taken up by the veins and carried to the central organs—brain, lungs, and kidneys, &c—and thus causing death. This result, he states, is a common cause of death when a bone is much fissured and the cancellous tissue laid open as in the V-shaped fracture of the tibia, and more particularly when this is compound. He does not inform us how this accident can he avoided. Teeatment.— The principles of the treatment of fractures are very Treatment, simple, though the practice is often very difficult. To restore a hone to its normal position, and to keep it there by means of surgical appli- ances, or as John Hunter expressed it in 1787, “to place the parts in a proper position by art, that is, as near their natural position as possible and keep them so” are simple rules to he observed, hut to carry them out often demands the highest surgical skill and ingenuity; principles, and yet the whole treatment of fractures is really comprised in these two indications. In examining a fracture, the greatest care is requisite, and only suffi- Points to be cient manipulation should be allowed to ascertain the seat of the fracture, learnt by an the line of its direction, and the tendency a fragment may have to ride exaniInati°®- in any direction—this special tendency being the one point to be remembered in the treatment. These points, moreover, should he made out at the single examination prior to treatment; for repeated exami- nations whether by the responsible surgeon or his assistants are to he condemned, as they can only do mischief by exciting more local irritation than is necessary, and adding to the injury which the mus- cles and soft parts have already sustained. For this reason, when after an accident, a fracture is suspected to have taken place, the surgeon or bystanders should do no more than bind the limb to some immove- time of able apparatus such as a wisp of straw, a bundle of sticks, or two mjury- pieces of wood fixed by a handkerchief, till the sufferer has beenON FRACTURES. 378 In field.

When the lower extremity is the affected part, the injured limb may be bound to the sound one, the latter acting as a splint. In compound fracture, the same precautions are necessary. Bleeding should be arrested by the application over the wound of a pad or bandage kept in position by means of pressure and the elevation of the limb, while in more severe cases the tourniquet or some local pressure over the main artery may be called for. If these precautions are not observed on the field, many lives are lost from haemorrhage, simple fractures are turned into compound, while compound fractures are made worse. When a patient is placed in bed where he is to be treated, the frac- ture ought to be manipulated, and its ‘position, nature, and peculiar tendency made out, and when made out to be “ set,” or put up, at once. The only exception to this rule is, when time has been allowed to pass before treatment is commenced and much oedema or swelling of the injured extremity exists, then it is better to fix the injured limb raised upon a pillow with a long sand bag on either side to act as a splint, and possibly a third round the foot, the pillow and side sand bags being firmly bound together by a strip of bandage and the whole forming an immoveable apparatus. Mr. Aston Key, indeed, was so fond of this mode of putting up fracture of the leg that in my “ dresser” days it was the usual mode of treating them all through their course, that is, for the first month or five weeks, till they could be put up in some starch or other immoveable apparatus, and the patient allowed to get up. The method is comfortable and satisfactory to the patient, but it wants closer attention on the part of the surgeon than can often be given. In “ setting” a fracture some care is needed, and the opposite and corresponding limb should always be before the surgeon as a guide. Inquiries should also be made as to the condition of the limb before the accident, whether it was deformed or shortened from any previous fracture or disease, congenital or otherwise, for I have known an injured leg to have been likewise violently and unnecessarily manipulated to restore a supposed fractured bone to a position that it could not be made to assume on account of some natural deformity, and likewise a fractured thigh subjected to like rough treatment to bring it down to the level of its fellow, when au irremediable shortening existed from a former fracture. In extending a broken limb to restore the bones to their normal posi- tion, the upper portion should be firmly held by an assistant—to make counter-extension—and the muscles attached to it relaxed by placing the limb in a slightly flexed position; a second assistant or the sur- geon may then extend the fractured end, while the latter gently mani- pulates the fracture to make out its points. The extension should be steady and free from all jerks and violent movement, gentle lateral, rotatory, or other movements being given as required to restore the displaced portion of bone ; the pressure of the thumb or finger being freely used to bring about an accurate co-aptation or setting of the fragments; for the surgeon must remember that muscular contraction is better overcome by continued extension than by temporary force, and that for the treatment of fractures generally, moderate extension continuously applied is preferable to forcible extension in any of379 ON FRACTURES. its forms. The inhalation of chloroform at times is a valuable aid in Chlorform. the reduction of a fracture. If, when the fractured bones haves been reduced, muscular spasm is Division of so severe as to render it impossible to keep them in sit'd, a condition tendons, which is not uncommon in fracture of the leg, the tendon of the offending muscle may be divided. In otherwise intractable fracture of the leg, there is no operation of greater value and attended with less evil than the division of the tendo Achillis. In a general way, how- ever, the muscular spasm ceases after the first three or four days. When the fracture has been reduced, and by manipulation co- Splints, aptated or “set,” splints or other mechanical appliances are neces- sary to keep the bones in their normal position, and the simpler these appliances are the better, so long as they fulfil their purpose. These splints should always be well padded, and the pads so adjusted as to fit into the inequalities of the limb, and protect it from any local pressure. They should be firmly and immoveably fixed to the limb by inelastic straps or bandages and the seat of fracture as a rule, should be left exposed for the surgeon’s examination, in order that the fracture may be re-adjusted if displacement take place. To cover up a broken bone by bandages or splints is a mistake. The position of the bone during the progress of repair should be always open to view, the former practice being based on hope, the latter on certainty. Pott’s rule, that the splints should include the joint above as well as below the fracture is sound, though it cannot always be followed. Every joint, however, should be fixed when by its action the broken bone is rendered movable. When one bone is broken in a limb where double bones exist, the second acts as a splint and keeps up extension. Under these circum- stances a simpler apparatus is required to keep the fractured bone quiet and restrain the action of the muscles that move it than under other circumstances. Extension is a valuable and necessary adjunct to other treatment. Extension, and should be kept up by means of weights, pulleys, or such other appliances as the ingenuity of the surgeon may suggest. These means however, will be described in the treatment of special fractures. After the setting of the fracture, the essential point to be observed After- in its treatment is, the immobility of the broken bone; and next to treatment, this, its exposure to observation during the progress of repair to render certain that the bone has maintained its right position. The treatment of compound fractures is similar to that of simple. Treatment of plus that of the wound with its complications and the broken frag- compound ments or projecting portions of bone, “but rest of the bone is the fraclures- great object we have to aim at.”—John Hunter, 1787. These fractures should be “ set” in the same way as the simple, great care being observed in the manipulation that the soft parts are not more injured; loose fragments of broken bone must be taken away, projecting portions excised, and the bone reduced, the wound being en- larged when necessary to facilitate this act; the injured parts, too, ouo-ht to be thoroughly cleansed and all wounded vessels twisted or ligatured ; the bones should then be fixed immovably by means of splints, inter- rupted splints being often required. When the wound is not very ex- Scaling of the tensive, it should be sealed by means of a piece of lint saturated with *ouud. blood, or, with what is better, the compound tincture of benzoin.

Fracture bed. the carbolic-acid dressing is employed, the wound should be well washed with a weak solution of one part in a hundred, and dressed under the spray. The wound should be interfered with as little as possible, since now, as when the following words were uttered: “ The great mischief and bad success arising in the treatment of compound fractures is the dressing them every day and applying fresh poultices which necessarily move the ends of the bones. The limb if possible should never be moved.”—John Hunter, MS. Lect 1787. When the soft parts are much crushed, and the large vessels and nerves injured, amputation may be called for, more particularly in old subjects. In compound fractures “ scarcely any amount or form of fractured bone alone/’ writes Skey (‘ Operative Surg.’), “ would justify the im- mediate resort to the knife if taken singly, even supposing the bone fractured extensively into a large joint; for in such a case, although anchylosis of the joint would probably occur, it would prove a lesser evil than that of amputation. Superadded to a compound or commi- nuted fracture of bone, the injury may be rendered yet more serious by extensive laceration of the muscles. In considering this latter condition much will depend on the kind of laceration, whether the muscles are merely cut asunder, or whether contused or torn, and whether this injury involves a few only or the majority of the muscles of the limb. Again, we must examine with great care the condition of the vessels. Is the main trunk whole ? we might ask, in the sup- posed case of fracture of the thigh ; or in that of the leg, is the pos- terior tibial artery torn ? Is the limb colder than its fellow, or is the temperature considerably lower than the rest of the body ? If so, probably one or more arteries are divided. What is the condition of the nerves ? Does sensibility extend to the toes ? If not, probably the nerve is divided also. If the evidence of the integrity of both artery and nerve fail, and the sinking temperature of the limb and the loss of sensibility continue to increase, we have no alternative but ampu- tation.” If a doubt exist in the mind of the surgeon on the necessity of immediate amputation, he should wait, unless the patient be old, in which case let him act promptly. Simple fractures into joints require special treatment, as in a large number of cases although not in all, some impaired mobility of the joint will ensue; for this reason the joint itself should be placed at the most useful angle, and so fixed. Compound fractures into joints generally demand excision or ampu- tation. In the upper extremity when there is any hope of saving the limb, excision is doubtless the better operation. In the lower, the expectant treatment is certainly better than excision, and probably better than amputation if the parts,are not so injured as to render amputation at once a necessity, and if the age and general condition* of the patient justify an attempt to save the limb; but these points will again have to be considered among the special fractures. In gunshot wounds these views are now generally entertained. The fracture bed.—The best is, without doubt, a good horsehair mat- trass placed on a bedstead with a firm bottom; but where this does not exist, a board beneath the mattrass is a good substitute. A canvas381 ON FRACTURES. bottom, however tightly corded, always yields, and a feather or ordinary spring bed is not to be sanctioned. The woven wire mattrass is excellent. The sheet covering the bed should he stretched and kept smooth several times daily so that no “ ruck ” takes place, bed-sores being more frequently caused by such than by pressure. In fracture of the lower extremity the head of the patient should not he raised too high, the use of one small pillow being ample. Splints made of wood, iron, felt, or perforated zinc may be employed, Splints, and the different forms will be given when the special fractures are considered. As a rule, the simpler in construction they are the better; and before adapting one to the broken limb it is well to fit it to the sound. The splints should invariably he quite clean. Pads.—All splints should he well padded and their edges carefully fads, protected. The pads should consequently he well fitted, broad, and overlapping the sides. The best materials for these are tow or fine oakum, cotton, or sheep’s wool, or, strips of thick flannel enclosed in a casing of soft iinen or lint. The pads should he first fixed to the splint by tapes, or, by what is better, some pieces of strapping. Besides wooden and iron splints, what the French called the “im- immoveable moveable apparatus ” for fractures is a very favourite one, and the bandages, material employed may he left to the fancy or convenience of the surgeon. In fractures of such single bones as the fibula or tibia where no displacement exists, their primary treatment by some immoveable apparatus is very valuable, the limb being either put up at once before swelling has appeared, or as soon as the swelling, &c., has subsided. In other cases it is inexpedient to employ it for at least ten or four- teen days, until swelling has gone and a certain amount of repair taken place. In the fracture of long bones such as the femur, it is better to postpone its application till union is complete. Some ex- cellent surgeons and among them Erichsen, employ the immoveable apparatus from the very first. The mode of its application is as Their follows :—In all cases the limb should be cleansed and carefully dried, application, the hone itself being well protected by cotton-wool or a flannel ban- dage. The bandage with the stiffening material, is then to he pre- pared, and should he put on as smoothly as possible, no more “ turns ” being employed than are absolutely necessary. Splints of gutta percha, millboard, leather, Cooking’s poroplastic, or hatter’s felt, or perforated zinc, may be employed as additional supports when complete immobility is demanded. The first five mate- rials, after having been cut to pattern, should beforehand be well softened by immersion in hot water or hot air and then moulded to the limb; the zinc should he carefully cut to fit it and well adjusted. These splints should be applied over the cotton-wool or flannel bandage, and the prepared bandage then bound round. When starch is used (Seutin’s bandage) it should he exterior, two or three coats being employed. The same may he said when the white of egg or dextrine is employed. When gum and chalh are used, the same mode ought to be followed,' the mixture consistiug of equal parts of finely powdered gum and chalk made into the consistence of thick paste by the addition of boiling water gradually stirred into it.

Mr. Dc Morgan prefers the glue bandage; the best French glue, after having been soaked in cold water and melted in a glue pot, being applied like the starch ; the addition of about one fifth of the bulk of the solution of methylated spirit hastens the drying. When plaster of Paris is employed, the bandage should be of some loose texture and that made of book muslin or crinoline is probably the best. It should be prepared beforehand by rubbing well fresh dry powder into its texture, and made ready for use by being tho- roughly wetted in a bowl of water for two or three minutes; some additional plaster being rubbed with water into the bandage as it is unrolled to strengthen the whole. When the surface is extensive the setting of the plaster may be delayed by the addition of a little size or stale beer to the water with which it is mixed, while salt and the use of warm water increase the rapidity with which the plaster sets. The day following the application of this bandage, a coating of flour, paste, gum, or even a coating of varnish, may be applied to prevent chipping. In the appendix to the ‘ Army Medical Report ’ for 1869, Mr. Moffitt describes the Bavarian mode of putting up a fracture in an immove- able apparatus, a mode which deserves to be more widely known than it is. I have tested it well, employing gum and chalk instead of plaster of Paris, and can strongly recommend it, being simple, can be applied very quickly, and is most effective. It is now in general use at Guy’s, and is applied as follows :—The materials required to make it are, a piece of stout, “ coarse house-flannel,” which has been shrunk, some precipitated chalk, mucilage of gum acacia, a good-sized cradle, and a stout needle and thread. When it is applied to the leg for fracture, two equal-sized pieces of the flannel are first cut, long enough to reach from the lower border of the patella to three inches below the heel, and, in breadth about six inches more than the circumference of the calf, so as to allow the edges to overlap for about three inches when the flannel is folded round the leg. One of these pieces should now be applied to the leg, its centre corresponding with the centre of the calf; and its two flaps brought tightly together over the skin (Fig. 476), where they should be firmly stitched together, the Fig. 476.

The stitching must be begun at the upper part, carried down to the hollow of the instep.ON FRACTURES. 383 and then fastened off. Having arrived at this point, the next thing is to see that the foot is at a right angle with the leg; if left alone it will probably be at a very obtuse angle, and considerable force is sometimes necessary to bring the toes up, which must be done now or not at all. The stitching must next be begun on the sole of the foot, commencing at the toes and proceeding towards the heel, the flannel being tightly dragged downwards. The stitching along the sole of the foot being completed, the remaining piece along the dorsum of the foot may next be stitched, and after this there can be no fear of the foot changing its position. The limb will now be tightly encased in a layer of flannel, the edges of which are lying in adaptation in front of the leg. The flannel along the sole of the foot to within an inch of the stitches should next be cut off and the edges turned back. At present the superfluous flannel along the front of the leg and dorsum of the foot should not be inter- fered with, but the limb slung up to the cradle by three or four pieces of bandage, pinned or stitched to the adapted edges of flannel in front of the leg (Pig. 476). This will have the effect of stretching the flannel and making it more closely adapt itself to the shape of the calf, ankle-joint, &c., and allow the gum and chalk to be easily applied. The next thing is, to make a thick paste of the gum and chalk the con- sistence of honey by stirring them together in a basin, which should be spread thickly over the surface of the flannel with a brush, or rubbed in with the palm of the hand, care being taken that it enter all the little inequalities of the flannel. Having done this, apply the outer layer of flannel, placing it just as the first was placed, with its centre corresponding with the median line of the calf, folding its edges closely around the leg, and bringing them up together in front over the edges of the previous layer. Keep them also in position in front by about half-a-dozen stitches put through at intervals down the leg close to the shin. Along the sole of the foot this layer of flannel may at once be neatly finished off by turning in the edges and joining by stitches. The whole should now be left suspended to the cradle for about twenty-four hours to dry, at the end of which time it may be taken down, and the splint removed from the leg by cutting up the stitches along the front of the leg and dorsum of the foot with a pair of scissors, aided by forcibly separating the adjacent edges of flannel. It now only remains to trim up the splint by cutting off the super- Binding fluous edges, binding them with strips of leather made adhesive by 5Pluit- being spread with resin plaster, and inserting eyelet-holes at equal distances all down, so as to lace the splint up the front (Fig. 476a). If the splint is required fora knee-joint, some modifications of the above For plan is necessary. It will not do to suspend the limb to a cradle by the knee-joint, edges of the flannel as in the previous case, but the patient should be seated in a chair before a fire, with the heel resting on another chair. Then the first layer of flannel should be tightly applied, its edges being brought up together in front, and stitches inserted close to the leg. The gum-and- chalk paste may now be thickly spread over the surface of this flannel and covered in by a second layer of flannel exactly as in the previous case. This second layer may be fastened in front by a few stitches, and the whole allowed to dry. When quite dry the adjacent edges of flannel may be forcibly separated and the stitches divided with scissors. Lastly, the superfluous edges may be cut off, two semilunar pieces cut out for the patella, the margins bound with leather and eyelet-holes inserted for384 ON FRACTURES. For hip-joint. Hyde’s felt splint. Paraffine. Silicate of potash. Contraction on drying. lacing up in front. To apply the splint to the hip-joint, it is necessary that the first layer of flannel should surround the pelvis as high as the crests of the ilium, and also the affected thigh. It should then be stitched along the outer side in one continuous seam and the superfluous edges allowed to remain in apposition. The gum-and-chalk paste must then he applied, some difficulty being probably experienced in applying it over the sacrum, but the patient must he rolled first to one side and then to the other. While this is being done the second layer of flannel should be lying underneath, so as to protect the bed, which may then he adapted and fastened closely by a few stitches, along the line of the previous sutures. When the whole is dry, it may or may not be found necessary to rip it up and insert eyelet-holes. If the splint fit closely without causing any undue pressure, the edges may be cut off close, and the whole allowed to remain as it is, hut for the sake of cleanliness, especially in children, it is generally better to cut up the stitches along the outer side, hind the edges with leather and lace it up, so as to allow the splint to be removed as often as requisite. When extra stiffness is required in any of these splints, the inner surface of the second layer of flannel may he covered with the chalk paste before it is applied, some strips of tin, or a piece of gutta-percha which has been moulded to the part should be introduced between the two layers of flannel.1 In cases of compound fracture, an opening suitable to the wound may easily be made. This splint is as good for joint cases as for those of fracture, indeed it is by far the best immoveable apparatus we possess. Mr. Hyde, of Mortimer Street, has introduced a “ leather-felt splint ” of great value, which is readily applied, is light and strong, and rarely requires to be used with starch. Cooking’s poroplastic splint answers the same purpose, the splint becoming soft on immersion in hot air or water, and hard again within a few minutes of its removal. If, when moulded, it fails to fit exactly, it can be softened locally by the appli- cation of a hot-water sponge. Mr. L. Tait (‘ Med. Times,’ 1865) has suggested the use of paraffine for the same purpose, the melted paraffin being kept liquid by the immersion of the bowl containing it in hot water, the bandage as it is being applied, being made to pass through the liquid paraffin melt- ing at 105° to 120° F. Two or more coats of paraffin may he painted over the whole. The liquid glass, silicate of potash, may also be used, the solution being painted over the bandage with a brush. I have used it and like it, hut not so much as the splint I have described. By way of caution it should he stated that all starch, chalk, and plaster-of-Paris splints contract on drying, and from such contractions I have known harm, and even gangrene to follow. To guard against this contingency when bandages are used, cotton-wool should be applied freely around the limb ; although in the Bavarian splint this precau- tion is not called for. On this account, the practice of using these splints, as a primary application in the treatment of fractures is dangerous; for when swelling to any extent takes place, the pressure may be most harmful. 1 I am indebted to a valued pupil, Mr. W. H. Harsant, for the above description of the splint.385 REPAIR OP FRACTURES. When pain or swelling of the limb follows the application of any of these splints, they should he at once removed, the whole being cut up, with strong scissors from end to end, eyelets being subsequently introduced for laces to draw them together again, or, straps and buckles may be employed. . .„ ,, . , Repair of fractures.—In children broken bones repair rapidly, four Repair of weeks being ample time for the whole process to be perfected, while in the aged, ten weeks or more may be needed. Repair goes.on more rapidly when the broken ends of the bones are placed and kept in position than when they are apart or not kept at perfect rest. When bones are maintained accurately in position or are impacted, direct union ensues as in the soft parts, but when movement is allowed, reparative material provision(ll is poured out around the broken fragments, and the provisional callus of authors, or the ensheathing callus of Paget, is formed, which, acting as a temporary splint, keeps the bones in position till they unite by means of the permanent callus. The best repair of a fracture is the direct, and when provisional callus exists some mobility of the broken bone has been allowed, to a certainty. This addition to our knowledge is due to Sir J. Paget, for until his day, a provisional callus was always looked upon as a necessary means for the repair of every fracture. We now know it is only present when mobility of the fragments interferes with direct repair, and, in proportion to the amount of provisional callus, may the extent of mobility be estimated. When a bone is broken, blood is effused, the amount depending upon Effusion of the degree of injury to the soft parts and the amount of comminution blood, of the bone; it is exceptional to find blood between the broken bones. In simple fracture the periosteum may be only torn across; in the Laceration of comminuted it is more extensively injured, while in incomplete frac- periosteum, tures it is probably always entire. After a simple fracture some slight inflammatory exudation may be poured out around the broken bone, which in healthy subjects is very limited and unattended by any constitutional symptoms. In more complicated cases or in cachectic subjects, the effusion may be exten- sive, and constitutional symptoms with febrile disturbance severe. Under favorable conditions, this inflammatory material will be absorbed with the effused blood. The true reparative material is poured out about the sixth or ninth day, and, when no displacement exists, it will be effused only between the ends of the broken bones; when, however, the bones are comminuted it will be more diffused. When they are misplaced, it will be still less defined, and when the periosteum is much separated or torn, it will be poured out around the bones as a provisional callus. The true reparative products are chiefly poured out by the peri- Reparative osteum and endosteum, though the soft parts around at times add their products quota. In the flat bones, the ossification of this reparative material has a 'or®e? ,)-v preliminary fibrous tissue stage, and in the long after the blood has ami Um been absorbed, the cell infiltration passes on to the formation of con- endosteum, nective tissue or neoplasm which subsequently ossifies, in rare cases passing through the stage of fibro-cartilage. In children, it is probable that the cartilaginous stage always precedes the osseous, while in adults, the bone is poured out at once, which is probably always the case in all rapidly repairing fractures. Ossification may take place in the periosteal blastema or in the endosteal or in both—these points being greatly determined by the vol. ii. 25REPAIR OF FRACTURES. 386 % Fibrous union. St»gfi8 Of repair. Repair in compound fractures. Unnnited fractures. Causes. relative position of the broken ends of the shaft of the bone and the comminution of the fragments; great displacement and separation of the fragments being bridged over or cemented together by irregular masses of connecting bone tissue. When immobility of the broken bones has not been maintained, the bone cement or provisional callus will be very extensive. In the ribs where it is impossible to prevent movement, there is always some ensheathing callus; indeed, Dupuytren’s ring of provisional callus is constant. In the clavicle also it is common. In other bones, it will vary with the amount of movement that has been allowed in their treatment. When the movement is very great, the process of ossifica- tion will not go on kindly, and ligamentous or fibrous union will remain, giving rise to an ununited fracture, and occasionally a false joint is formed. (A splendid example of this is represented in Fig. 477.) The rapidity with which ossification or true bony union is obtained in fracture depends much on the degree of immobility insured to the broken bones and the constitutional power of the patient. The period in which the several parts of the reparative process are usually completed after fractures of adult human bones are reckoned thus according to Paget:—To the second or third day after the injury, inflammation in and about the parts; thence to the eighth or tenth seeming inaction, with subsidence of inflammation; thence, to about the twentieth, production of the reparative material, and its gradual development to its fibrous or cartilaginous condition ; thence- forward its gradual ossification, a part of the process which is most variable in both its time of commencement and its rate of progress, and which is probably rarely completed before the ninth or tenth week. In open or compound fractures, repair goes on very much in the same way as in simple, and when they are made simple by sealing the wound, precisely in the same way. When the wound is left open and suppuration takes place in the soft parts around the broken fragments, repair goes on through granulation, the granulation tissue subsequently ossifying and passing into bone-cells ; the process of repair under these circum- stances being more gradual than where the reparative material is poured out between the broken bones, and goes on directly to ossify. At times after a simple fracture, but more commonly after a com- pound, the fractured bone inflames, and, as a result, the broken frag- ments die wholly or in part, repair is retarded and cannot be perfected until the necrosed bone has been cast off or removed. In comminuted compound fracture, this result is more common than in less complicated cases. In gunshot injuries of bones this comminution of the bone is the chief point of difference between them and other compound fractures. Compound fractures, as a rule, require for their repair three or four times the period required in simple. Ununited fractures are met with ,when, from any local or general cause, ossific union is delayed or does not take place between the broken ends of the bones, and in by far the bulk of cases, this is the result of a want of that complete rest and quiet which is so essential for the ossific union of a broken bone. When the ends of the broken bone are kept asunder, ossific union is likewise sure to be retarded or prevented, and also when anyON UNUNITED FRACTURES. 387 muscle or fascia is placed between the broken fragments. In feeble cachectic and syphilitic subjects the same want of repair may like- wise be met with. Failures in the reparative process depend therefore on some failure in the general power of the patient, want of care in the local treatment of the case, or on some local cause. The union, however, is, as a rule, simply delayed. Hamilton calculates that such delayed union occurs once in 500 Statistics, cases, but this average I believe to be too high. It is chiefly found, Most according to Norris (‘Amer. Journ. of Med. Sciences,’ 1842), in the frequent seat, thigh, leg, arm, forearm, and lower jaw. I have seen it, however, in the clavicle and in the ribs, and cases are recorded in which it was met with in the spine. In the majority of cases, the union of the broken bones is by fibrous tissue which has failed to ossify. In Prep. 111080, Guy’s Museum, this condition is well exemplified, the ends of the bone being pointed and firmly joined by ligamentous tissue. The length of this tissue varies in different cases. In exceptional instances, the ends of the bone are rounded and enclosed by a strong capsular ligament, and thus a false joint is formed, which is well exemplified in a specimen of frac- ture of the forearm (Guy's Mu- seum, 1119 s0), but still better in that of the humerus (Prep. 111085), Fig. 477) in which the ends of the bone are studded with fibro-cartilage, and com- plete movement existed. In more rare cases there is a total absence of all uniting medium. Treatment.—Regarding a large majority of cases of un- united fracture, as examples of delayed union, due to a want of that absolute immobility of the fractured limb which is so essential for its repair, the most essential point to be observed in treatment is, the application of an absolutely immoveable appa- ratus, which may be found in one of the forms of splint described as Immobility, immoveable, such as that of starch, egg and flour, chalk, plaster of Paris, or liquid glass, with gutta percha, millboard, zinc, or felt; the joints above and below the broken bone being included in the apparatus, while tonic constitutional treatment is at the same time observed. When the limb is thus firmly fixed, rest and the non-use of the limb is scarcely necessary; indeed, under certain circumstances, the moderate use of the limb seems to be beneficial, and in several cases under my care, repair seems to have been hastened by such a licence. John Hunter saw the truth embodied in these remarks, having asserted in 1787: * When the uniting process in fractures is backwards, the388 ON UNUNITED FRACTURES. Resection only exceptionally required. Bigelow’s operation. Union becoming disunion. Deformity after union. Treatment. parts should not be kept at perfect rest. I have seen fractures of the leg which would not otherwise unite, do so after patients were up on their legs, the fractured bones being well supplied with iron splints, &c.’ (MS. Lect.). When these means fail, the ends of the hone may be well rubbed together to excite action before the re-application of splints, or subcutaneously scored with a tenotomy knife, while in still older cases the bones may he fastened together by means of wire sutures, or drilled and secured with ivory pegs, the credit of this latter suggestion being due to Dieffenbach. Dr. Physick, of New York, years ago (1804) suggested the introduction of a seton between the ends of the broken bones, and Norris reports that good success has followed the practice, 54 out of 72 cases being successful. The object of the treatment is to excite local action between the fragments, and when this is secured, the seton may be removed. With the same view Malgaigne introduced acupuncture needles between the bones, and Miller and M. Blandin subcutaneously scraped with a tenotomy knife the ends of the bones or the connective tissue. Resection has also been practised, and, according to Norris, with success in thirty-seven out of sixty-four cases. The operation, how- ever, is formidable, and should only be undertaken where there is no hope of minor measures being successful, the ends of the fragments being far apart, and the condition of the limb such as to render some risk justifiable to gain the desired end. I have performed this operation for ununited fractures of the femur and humerus with excellent results. Dr. H. J. Bigelow, of Harvard, has, however, met with considerable success in detaching the periosteum for about half an inch from the extremities of the affected hone with the muscles, taking off the ends of the bones and securing the resected portions together by strong wire passed through half the thickness of the shaft of either fragment; the periosteal flaps may also be united by sutures. The limb should then be fixed on a splint. The wire can be left in place without fear from two to six months. He cured ten out of eleven cases where this operation was performed. (‘ American Journ. of Med. Sciences,’ 1867.) It occasionally happens that a fracture which had united becomes disunited after fever, scurvy, or other enfeebling cause, and I have had one very marked case of this in the person of a young lady who had her thigh fractured abroad, and subsequently became the subject of tropical fever. In her case, although the bond of union completely gave way, she subsequently obtained a firm limb by means of local immobility and constitutional tonics. These cases ought to be classed with others in which the cicatrices of burns or old ulcers break down under some enfeebling influence, and heal under tonic and general hygienic treatment. In the treatment of all these cases time ought not to be estimated too closely. The deformities that follotv badly united fractures require at times surgical treatment, and, when the surgeon is consulted during the first few weeks of the case, chloroform should he given and the bone re- fractured and set in a good position—it being quite justifiable to employ considerable force to attain this end. In young subjects, this re-fracture is rarely attended with difficulty, while in the adult, some is usually found. (Esterlen and Skey were strong advocates for this practice, the former having emploj'ed it up to the twenty389 SPECIAL FRACTURES. fourth week, and the latter on a boy, set. 15, thirteen months after the fracture. When the hone has united too firmly to permit of re-fracture, it Osteotomy, should be divided by a subcutaneous section, or, by some cutting opera- tion. Key did this latter operation in the leg, in 1839 (‘ Guy’s Hosp. Rep./ series i, vol. iv), and Lister more recently has done the same (‘Brit. Med. Journ./ 1868). The subcutaneous section should be per- foi’med in a similar way to that adopted by W. Adams in dividing the neck of the thigh-bone with a saw or chisel. These operations, however, are only to be undertaken when the local deformity is great and the limb useless. In the incomplete or green-stick fractures of infancy, if the bone be not straightened, strange deformities ensue. In the case depicted in Pig. 478, such a result was to be seen, the bent tibia and fibula having been much thickened by the deposition of hone in the concavity of the arch, the bone measuring across its centre six inches. It was taken from a girl, twelve years old. SPECIAL FRACTURES.—FRACTURES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY.

May be compound and comminuted. from muscular actiou, and I have seen one in a man, set. 44 (who had had syphilis nine years before), from simply lifting a heavy weight from the ground. The bone broke near the sternal end with a snap, and a good recovery followed. The case was brought under my notice by Mr. Couling, now of Brighton, when house-surgeon at Guy’s. The statistics of the Middlesex Hospital, as compiled from the experience of sixteen years, by Messrs. Fowler and Hulke (Holmes’s ‘ System,’ vol. ii), prove the clavicle to be more frequently broken than any other single bone, the radius standing next in order, although, including frac- ture of the radius with the ulna, the fracture of the clavicle stands second. Half the recorded cases occurred in children under five years of age. The bone, as a rule, is broken about its centre, although fractures of either extremity are met with. The line of fracture with rare excep- tions is oblique from without inwards, and from before backwards; the inner fragment having commonly a tendency to ride over the outer, the outer falling downwards and backwards. The symptoms are generally well marked. There will be inability to move the arm freely, with pain in the attempt, the patient support- ing the arm of the affected side. On comparing the shoulders of the two sides, the joint on the affected will be placed lower and more forward than on the sound, and, at the same time, drawn nearer to the median line of the body, even for an inch where the displacement is great. On passing the finger over the broken bone some depression and corresponding elevation of the broken fragments will be made out, and when the examination is made after the expiration of days with the effusion of much solid material. Crepitus can sometimes be detected, but it need not be looked for—this symptom, with the amount of diplacement, depending much upon the line of the fracture and its situation. Dr. R. Smith, of Dublin, points out (‘Treatise on Fracture,’ 1850), how in fractures of the acromial end of the bone between the conoid and trapezoid ligaments, there is scarcely any displacement of either fragment; and, under these circumstances, the diagnosis has to be made by the pain produced on pressure over the broken point, and the crepitus educed by the movement of the bones in opposite directions through the fingers. He also shows, how in fracture external to the trapezoid ligament, the inner fragment being drawn upwards by the trapezius muscle, the displacement is great. In children, incomplete fractures of this bone may occur (Fig. 473). Fractures of the clavicle are sometimes comminuted and compound, and occasionally complicated with some severe injury to the vessels beneath. In the case of the late Sir R. Peel, the accident was followed by a pulsating blood tumour which was supposed to have been due to a rupture or laceration of some large vein, probably the subclavian, while from the severe pain that attended the injury, some of the nerves of the brachial plexus were believed to have been injured. Mr. Erichsen has recorded (‘ Brit. Med. Journ.,’ June 7, 1873) a case, in which the subclavian vein was compressed by a fragment of a broken clavicle, and in which amputation of the shoulder-joint was performed, on the sixteenth day, and I have seen one in which a broken clavicle wTas followed by arrest of pulsation in the artery of the correspond- ing arm. At St. George’s Hospital, there is a specimen in whichFRACTURE OF THE CLAVICLE. 391 tlie end of the fractured hone was driven through the internal jugular vein. Fractures of both clavicles have also been recorded. I have seen this more than once in children. Treatment.—Daily experience proves that fractures of the clavicle Treatment, unite without any treatment, and, moreover, by palpable deformity shows that where treatment has been employed, the union is neither perfect nor satisfactory. Daily experience likewise proves, that in most, if not all cases of fracture of the clavicle, the bones fall well into place on the patient assuming the recumbent position. In young ladies, and in others where it is a matter of importance to prevent deformity, this recumbent position in bed may be maintained for about three weeks till union has fairly taken place; but children and men will rarely be found willing to follow such a line of treatment, and happily it is not required, for nearly, if not quite equally good re- sults will be secured by imitating what takes place on the patient assuming the recumbent position, viz., by fixing the lower blade of the scapula to the chest, binding down its angle to the thorax, and thus preventing the tilting forwards and rotation of the bone through which the deformity takes place. The plan I have now adopted for some years is, to place a pad over Binding the blade of the scapula below its spine, and to bind the bone firmly scapula to to the thorax by means of broad strips of strapping obliquely en- thorax- circling half the chest from the spine to the sternum, at the same time supporting the affected arm in a sling, and drawing the hand upwards towards the opposite shoulder. This same method is also advocated by Dr. E. Hartshorne, of Pennsylvania. Whilst the strapping is being fixed, the scapula should be well tilted backwards by elevating the arm, or, the patient should be kept in the recumbent position. When this practice cannot be followed, the elbow should be brought forward to a point below the nipple of the affected side and the hand drawn over the opposite shoulder. The old plan of fixing the pad in the axilla and using a figure-of-eight bandage is of no benefit, and, moreover, causes much discomfort to the patient. The axillary pad of Desault is, at times serviceable, and may be em- ployed, being easily fixed by a broad piece of strapping made to encircle the shoulder. In addition to the pad, Professor Gordon, of Belfast (‘ Dublin Quart.,’ 1S59), recommends the injured arm to be extended down- wards and firmly fixed to the body by a bandage, permanent extension being kept up by means of a band fastened above to the forearm flexed at right angles, and below, around the perinteum or upper part of the thigh. Fractures of the scapula, probably, are always the result of direct vio- lence, although a fracture of its neck may be produced by a fall upon the shoulder. Fig. 479. Scapula. Fracture of scapula.

Symptoms The body of the bone may he fissured in any direction (Fig. 479), though much displacement is rare. In this accident, mobility of the broken bone and crepitus may usually be made out by manipulation; though in fat subjects and when effusion exists the diagnosis may be difficult. Treatment.—A broad pad carefully adjusted and kept in position by means of broad strips of plaster encircling half the thorax, the arm being kept quiet and the elbow raised in a sling, is usually sufficient treatment, although a good shield of gutta percha or felt may be sometimes beneficial. The acromion process may be fractured across its base or in any other part, and, when it is so the outer fragment is generally drawn down- wards with the arm, producing a dropping of the shoulder. The accident can readily be made out, on tracing the spine of the scapula outwards, by the deformity, the break in the normal line of the bone, and the local pain, if not by the separation of the fragments. There is also loss of power in the arm and alteration in its outline. It should be treated by raising the elbow by means of a good sling or bandage, a small axillary pad and a circular bandage binding the arm to the thorax. The union, however, is often ligamentous, it being im- possible to keep the fragments of bone closely in apposition. Fractures of the coracoid process are remarkably rare. I have seen but one decided instance, and that in a girl, set. 15 or 16, the result of a blow. There was local pain and crepitus to denote the injury with dis- placement of the process, its point being drawn downwards by the biceps muscle, and its base projecting. It is more commonly associated with dislocation of the humerus. Treatment.—The muscles attached to the process must be relaxed, the biceps by flexing the forearm, and the coraco-brachialis by drawing the arm forwards and inwards. In this position, the arm should be bound by a bandage, the bone itself, if possible, being restored to its normal position by manipulation. Fractures of the neck of the scapula or of the glenoid fossa must be rare. Sir A. Cooper described such cases, but since Malgaigne showed how the symptoms described might be produced by dislocation of the shoulder with fracture of the glenoid cavity, some doubt has been thrown upon the question of a simple fracture of the neck of the bone ever occurring. In Guy’s Museum, prep. 109785, there is a specimen of fracture of the neck (Fig. 480), and in the Royal College of surgeons there is a second, the third being recorded in Du Yerney, ‘ Traite des Maladies des Os,’ 1751. Sir A. Cooper gives the flattening and sink- ing of the shoulder, the prominence of the acromion, the elongation of the arm, and the presence of crepitus as the chief symptoms, the head of the humerus being felt in the axilla. He also relates how the arm may be replaced in its normal position and again displaced on allowing the arm to drop, this symptom being the393 FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. chief one of diagnosis between the supposed accident and dislocation but, when dislocation of the head of the humerus exists with fracture of the glenoid fossa, the same symptoms are found. The subject, therefore, requires further elucidation. In suspected cases of this kind the elbow should be raised, in order to press the head of the bone well Treatment, upwards into position, and kept there by sling and bandage. I have seen a case of dislocation of the head of the humerus down- Case, wards and forwards, complicated with a fracture of the lower portion of the glenoid cavity, the broken piece being drawn downwards. Fractures of the humerus form about one seventh of all fractures. Fractures of and are about half as frequent as fractures of the clavicle and scapula humerus, together. They are commonly the result of direct violence, and occa- sionally of muscular action. They may be divided into fractures of the head and tuberosities, shaft, and condyles. Fractures involving the head and tuberosities are usually the re- Fracture of suit of a blow or a fall upon the shoulder, although occasionally they follow falls on the elbow. In a case that came under my care in 1877 and died from other injuries, the greater tuberosity was crushed Causes, off and displaced upwards from a fall upon the shoulder. This accident could never have been made out during life. In all cases, the direction of the violence is an important point to discover, as by it the surgeon obtains the best guide to the position of the fragments as well as the nature of the injury. When the line of fracture follows that of the anatomical neck, it is intracapsular; and when it occurs, the head of the bone may be completely separated and left as a foreign body in the joint; yet such cases are very rare. In others, such as Fig. 481 illustrates, the head is separated and the tuberosity fractured; more commonly, however, the fracture is impacted, the lower fragment being either driven into the head of the bone, or the head driven into the neck, the greater tuberosity, as a rule, being broken (Fig. 482). Dr. R. Smith, of Dublin, states that when this accident exists, the arm is shortened, the acromion process projects, the shoulder loses its rounded form, the shaft of the humerus approaches the acromion, and the head of the bone cannot be felt. When the tuberosity is broken off, crepitus may be detected. In 1868,1 saw such a case in a woman, £et. 59, who had fallen on the shoulder nineteen days previously, the case having been treated as one of contusion. Shortening in the arm of three quarters of an inch, and a distinct prominence of bone with thickening could be felt between the acromion and coracoid processes; while the head of the bone rotated freely in the glenoid cavity. In it, there was some flattening of the deltoid. A good recovery took place with per- manent shortening. I saw also a similar case in 1865, in an old man set. 82, in -which good repair took place.

More commonly a fracture about tbe head of the bone means a fracture in the line, or a separation of the epiphysis, the epiphysis including the head and the tuberosities. This accident is generally the result of a fall on the elbow, and the symptoms of the accident are tolerably distinct. The head of the bone can be felt in its normal position, but is not movable on rotating the shaft, while the end of the displaced shaft is usually sent forward. When fractured, the bone presents a sharp edge and outline; but when displaced—an accident that can only occur in subjects under twenty-one—the end of the bone appears rounded and slightly convex. It is, moreover, drawn forward by the action of the pectoral muscles, and made to pro- ject beneath the coracoid process in a marked and characteristic manner. In Fig. 483, taken from a male patient of mine, set. 16, this is well seen. Fig. 483. Separation of shaft of humerus from upper epiphysis. When the separation is complete, the displacement will be very marked. When partial, it will be equally characteristic, but, in partial dislocation of the shaft, some mobility of the head of the bone will exist. In this accident the shaft may be at times re-placed by manipulation, “ but the moment the parts are abandoned to the uncontrolled action of the muscles the deformity recurs.”—R. Smith. When impaction of either fragment exists, no crepitus will be felt unless forcible movement be made, when it may be elicited. Care how- ever, should be observed in seeking for this information, as a forcible separation of the impacted bones is a fatal error. The accident is gene- rally to be made out by the nature of the injury, the shortening of the limb, the absence of crepitus, and the movement of the head of the bone on making gentle rotation of the shaft. In fractures of the anatomical neck when the head of the bone is driven into the tuberosity and shaft, as in all other forms of impacted fracture, union will go on if the impacted bones are not displaced by manipulation. The surgeon, therefore, has only to apply some simple splint, such as an anterior and posterior or lateral, or Stromeyer’s cushion (Fig. 497), to maintain rest, and the same treatment is applied in fracture or separation of the epiphyses when the bones havesimulate that of dislocation. The mistake, how- FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. Prep. 1107 s”. 395 been replaced. In the case illustrated in Fig. 483, a capital arm existed. Fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus below the tuberosities, is, however, probably the most common form of accident, and the line of fracture may he transverse or oblique (Fig. 484). In it, when the bone is broken above the insertion of the pectoral muscle—its usual seat—the lower frag- ment is drawn inwards towards the chest, whilst the upper fragment is drawn upwards and ouhuards by the muscles that are inserted into the tuberosities. The bone projects forward or backward according to the direction of the fracture, the direction de- pending greatly upon that of the force. The more oblique the line of fracture, the greater the de- formity. Impaction of the broken fragments may occur in this as in the last fracture, the lower usually penetrating the upper. When, after a separation of the upper epiphysis or fracture through the tuberosities or neck of the bone, the upper end of the diapliysis or the lower fragment of the broken bone is drawn inward and forward by the pectoral muscles, the case may ever, should not be made, as in the early period of the accident increased mobility of the bone and crepitus should be enough to indicate its nature; and, in the later period when the deformity produced by the end of the lower fragment is visible, the accident is palpable. Treatment.—The nature of the accident having been ascertained and Treatment, the question of impaction or non-impaction decided, the treatment becomes simple, for in the impacted fracture whether of the anatomical or surgical neck, the aim should be to keep the impacted bones in position and to prevent their being loosened so that natural processes may effect a cure in a month or six weeks with a limited degree of deformity; and, in a non-impacted fracture, the first aim is to bring the hones into as good apposition as possible, and to keep them there by means of splints and position. In doing this the tendency of the fracture has to be considered, w'hich is that the lower fragment is drawn inwards by the pectoral muscle, and the upper fragment outwards by the scapular muscles. The best plan to carry out these objects is to fix the arm between any inside right angular and outside straight splints, the former extending from the axilla to the wrist, and the latter to the elbow, the two being bound well together. It is a dangerous practice simply to place the forearm in a sling and bind the arm to the side. When much injury to the soft parts or any wound exists, it is an excellent plan to draw the arm outward from the body at half a right angle and to rest it on the splint with the forearm partially flexed, care being taken that the lower fragment is not drawn too far inward, or to bind it on Stromeyer’s cushion. At other times, a good gutta-percha, felt, or leather casing, moulded to the shoulder and arm is very efficient. Erichsen advises a bent Fig. 484. Of surgical neck. May simulate dislocation.

Boyer’s rule. leather splint, the angle being well pressed into the axilla, with one half fixed to the arm, and the other to the thorax. In all these cases the surgeon should explain to the patient that some impairment of the mobility of the limb may be expected, and some shortening in impacted fractures. Fracture of the greater tuberosity is a recognised accident, and is usually associated with dislocation of the humerus forwards, the scapular muscles drawing the tuberosity backward. Dr. R. Smith, in his excellent work on Fractures, gives a description of two of these cases. He describes a remarkable increase in the breadth of the articu- lation, the projection of the acromion and flattening of the deltoid, as the most striking features of the injury. He also draws attention to the vertical sulcus corresponding to the bicipital groove, formed by the head of the bone on the inner side and the displaced tube- rosity on the outer, as one of the characteristic symptoms. Fractures of the shaft of the humerus are common, and more readily made out as well as successfully treated than any other fracture. When oblique, they are frequently followed by some degree of shorten- ing, hut this result is of little practical importance, as it interferes hut slightly with the functions of the hand. Such fractures are as commonly the result of direct as of indirect violence, muscular action being by no means an uncommon cause. I have already mentioned an instance in which it occurred in a man during a marital embrace, and a second produced by throwing a ball. Lonsdale, Malgaigne, Hamilton, and others have recorded similar instances. When the fracture is transverse, there is no displacement. When oblique, the tendency of the lower fragment to ride will depend upon the line of the obliquity and its position. WTien the line of fracture is below the insertion of the deltoid, the upper fragment will have a tendency to he drawn outwards; when above this point, the upper fragment will be attracted inwards by the pectoral muscles, the lower fragment being drawn upwards and outwards by the deltoid. Loss of power in the arm, mobility of the bone, crepitus, local pain, and deformity are ample symptoms to indicate the accident. An error in diagnosis ought not to occur. Tkeatment.—This is not really difficult, although from the fact that united fracture is more frequently found in this bone than in any other, it would appear as if the practice were less successful. In a measure, this conclusion must be regarded as correct, and I would explain it by the want of a due appre- ciation of Boyer’s rule of treat- ment, viz., to keep the joints above and below the broken Fig. 485. Splint for fracture at the shaft of the humerus.397 FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. bone in absolute rest; for in fractures of tbe arm, the common prac- tice of applying spints to it, and allowing perfect freedom to the action of tbe forearm, is to be condemned; because in moving the forearm the triceps and brachialis anticus with the biceps, have as powerful an action upon the humerus as upon the bones of the forearm. . . In the primary treatment of all fractures of the arm, it is. a wise and scientific practice to keep the forearm at rest, which is best done by the application of some angular splint extending from the shoulder or axilla to the wrist, associating with it a posterior or anterior short splint reaching from the shoulder to the elbow (Fig. 485). After about two or three weeks the angular splint may be removed, and some immovable one applied, the forearm being left free. Any splints that secure immobility of the broken bone after its ends have been co-apted by manipulation must be regarded as beneficial, and no splints can do this effectually that allows freedom of movement of the forearm. When two lateral splints appear the more adapted to keep the bones in position, they must be angular, to include the elbow, and bent at a right angle. The incomplete or green-stick fractures of children are well treated by millboard, gutta-percha, or felt splint, after the bone has been restored to its normal position. In putting up fractures of the arm, care should be observed not to press upon the musculo-spiral nerve as it winds round the bone, especially when the line of fracture corresponds to its position. Fractures involving the lower end of the humerus whether transverse Fractures above or vertical through the condyles, or both together; whether the lower complicated with separation of the epiphysis or some displacement of cni1- the bones of the forearm, are always difficult to diagnose and to treat; and when the joint is involved either by the fracture running into it or by displacement, there is usually some subsequent imperfection in its movement. Fractures above the condyles where the bone is thin and expanded, whether in the child or adult; or separation of the lower epiphysis (an accident of early life) are usually produced by some fall upon the elbow. When the line of fracture is oblique from behind forwards the action of the biceps and brachialis anticus has a tendency to draw the forearm with the lower fragment upward and forward. When the line of fracture is oblique from before backwards and upwards, the lower fragment of bone with the bones of the forearm is apt to be drawn backward by the action of the triceps, thereby giving rise to the external appearance of a dislocation of the bones of the forearm backwards, since there is the same projection of the olecra- non process and hollowness above it, the same projection of the lower end of the humerus forwards, with the pressing forwards of the artery in both accidents. There is, however, this great distinction between the fracture and dislocation, so well expressed by Sir A. Cooper. In fracture there is, he says, “ the removal of all marks of dislocation on extension, " P °mS and their return as soon as extension is discontinuedcrepitus of a marked kind is felt where a fracture is present, and of a suppressed kind where a displacement of the epiphysis exists; whereas in disloca- tion, no crepitus is present, and there is marked immobility of the393 FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. Symptoms. The existence of the fracture can be made out by manipulation, the amount of displacement varying with the character of the injury. Cre- pitus can also be detected by grasping one or other condyle and moving the broken fragment, while rotation of the radius often gives rise to it fractures involving the condyles of the humerus whether into the joint or not, the fragments should be brought into position by extension upon the forearm when needed, with manipulation, and an ante- rior jointed rectangular splint, applied; the upper half of the splint being well passed up the arm, and the lower to the wrist. In some cases, a posterior arm splint projecting down to the olecranon process is of use, the whole being well bound together and to the limb. The joint, as a rule, may be left exposed for external applications. Some surgeons prefer from the first an immovable casing of gutta percha or felt, while others, lateral leather or paste-board splints, but I think it preferable to leave the joint exposed. these periods, and passive movement allowed. Hamilton, however, in his great work on Fractures, states his belief, that passive movement ought to be commenced within seven days and perseveringly employed until the cure is accomplished. He does not admit the use of splints after this period, believing that the new material has steadied the fragments, and that the danger of diplacement is but little, while the prevention of anchylosis demands early and continued motion.

All these fractures into the elbow- joint are rapidly followed by effusion, which often masks the symptoms and renders the diagnosis difficult and uncer- tain.

Fracture of the radius may take place at its head, neck, shaft, or Of the radius, lower end. When of the neck or shaft, and transverse, the fragments of bone are usually loose, yielding on manipulation a distinct crepitus, the head of the bone being felt not to rotate in its position; but, when the head of the bone is fissured longitudinally no such symptoms will be present. Fractures of the lower end of the bone are of a verv vari- able nature; a large number of them are impacted, the compact shaft of the bone being driven into the cancellated carpal extremity. When impaction does not exist, it is from comminution of the lower fragment.PEACTUB.ES OP THE RADIUS. 400 In a case of injury to the right upper extremity in a man set. 30, complicated with brain mischief which came under my care in 1877, there was an impacted Colles’s fracture of the right radius and a vertical fracture of the head of the same hone into the joint. He had evidently fallen from a height upon his right hand and head. Causes. Fractures of the lower extremities are generally the result of a fall upon the hand, and are very common. Fractures of the shaft or neck may be produced in the same way, but are more commonly caused by direct violence. Colles’s Fractures of the lower end have always been of special interest. iracture. Colles, of Dublin, first described them in 1814 (Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal), and such injuries are now generally known as Colles’s fracture. Dr. R. W. Smith has also done much to draw attention to their nature in his work on fracture, where he explains the charac- teristic deformity by muscular action. Figs. 488-9 show the appear- Fiq. 488.

Callender on Callender, nowever, more recently, in an able paper (‘ St. Barth, deformity in j>ep}> 1865), has shown that Yoillemier, Malgaigne, and Nelaton’s fracture. views are the more correct, and that impaction rather than muscular action is the true explanation of the deformity. « The radius is first broken, then, by the momentary continuance of the force in the direction of the falling body, forwards and outwards, the shaft is driven into the carpal end, burying itself chiefly from the dorsal surface towards the palm, and towards the outer or the inner side. In a great number of cases this impaction so fixes the fragments that they cannot be unlocked, and the deformity is permanent.”— Callender. The thirty-six specimens of fracture of the lower end of the radius which the museums connected with the Loudon schools of medicine contain, clearly manifest that the cause of each deformity is the impaction .of the proximal in the distal portion of the broken bone.401 FRACTURES OF THE RADIUS. The fracture is usually placed about half an inch or an inch above Scat, the wrist-joint, and the lower fragment or epiphysis is displaced back- wards. It is, moreover, so displaced that the articular facet instead of looking downwards, forwards and inwards is made by rotation to look downwards, backwards, and outwards. The outer side of the fracture towards the styloid process is rotated more than the inner, the strong ligaments uniting this with the ulna holding the hone more in position. On this account the lower fragment is often also broken vertically, giving rise to greater deformity as well as to shortening of the bone on its outer border. In some cases, the end of the bone is comminuted (Guy’s Museum, 111932), and Fig. 491 illustrates a case of fracture of both radii from a fall on the hands. The diagnosis of this accident is not difficult; indeed, the aspect of Diagnosis, the wrist may be said to he characteristic. “ The posterior surface of the limb,” wrote Colies, “ pre- sents a considerable de- formity; for a depression is seen in the forearm, about an inch and a half above the end of the hone, whilst a consider- able swelling occupies the Fig. 491. wrist and indeed, the base of the appear to backwards so metacarpus; carpus and metacarpus be thrown much, as, on Prep. 1118s0.

On viewing the anterior surface of the limb we observe a considerable fulness as if caused bv the flexor tendons being thrown forwards; this fulness extends upwards to about one third ot the length of the forearm, and terminates below at the upper edge of the annular ligament of the wrist. The extremity of the ulna is seen projecting towards the palm and inner edge of the hmb. The amount of deformity turns upon the amount of displace- ment of the broken fragments. There will be pain in the part, increased by pressure on the seat of fracture and about the internal lateral liga- ment; the movement of the joint being rendered impossible. On feeble movement of the hand, the head of the radius will be felt to rotate, the fracture being commonly an impacted one; crepitus will either be absent or very indistinct, and can only be well brought out by in°oldTub|ectsbr°ken boues—a very questionable proceeding^ especially Treatment.—In all frac- tures of the radius, it is essential to keep the hand at rest, and, as a conse- quence, all splints should ex- tend at any rate down to the base of the fingers. In frac- tures of the neck or shaft, the elbow should be bent at right VOL. II. Fig. 492. Splints for fracture of forearm. 26 Treatment. Of neck and shaft.402 FRACTURES OF THE RADIUS. Lower end. Pistol splint condemned. Gordon’s splint. angles and the hand held midway between pronation and supination; two well-padded broad splints extending down to the fingers being firmly fixed on by strapping, broad bands, or a roller (Pig. 492). When, as in fractures of tbe shaft, there is a disposition for the fragments to fall inward, some extra pad may be employed. The splints should be removed after three weeks, and freedom given to the hand, movement of the muscles being encouraged; shorter splints or some immoveable apparatus should also be substituted down to the wrist whilst union is being consolidated. Lateral pressure of the bandages must always be avoided. In fractures of the lower extremity of the radius the old-fashioned pistol-shaped splint is still in favour with some, its object being to keep the hand and wrist adducted, and thereby to counteract the deformity that so commonly attends this form of fracture. Some surgeous, and more particularly the American apply it to the palmar, and others, in- cluding Nelaton, to the dorsal aspect, with a shorter second splint. I am no believer iu its virtues, for if the fracture be impacted, and the fragments are not loosened, it is useless, as union has only to go on between the impacted fragments for a cure to be effected; and when the fragments are loosened and the bones brought into apposi- tion by extension and manipulation, the pistol splint is not wanted, indeed, it is probably injurious, causing displacement of the broken bones. A well-padded broad anterior splint, reaching to the roots of the fingers, with a dorsal splint, answers every purpose, the wants of the individual case determining the amount and position of the extra padding. Ur. Gordon, of Belfast, has recently introduced a splint that has found favour. It “ consists of the body, the ulnar and bevelled por- tions, with a curved back splint. (Fig. 493.) The lower end of the ulnar portion is curved forwards and hollowed to receive the inner bor- der of the flexed hand, with a slit for the carpal strap. The bevelled portion is secured to the body of the splint nearly half an inch internal to its margin; it is cut off obliquely from without inwards and from below upwards; it is applied to the palmar surface of the upper frag- ment, which it is its office to fix. The lower end of the back splint is much curved forwards. This curve, with a thick pad, is necessary to enable it to press the base of the metacarpus, the cai’pus, and the lower end of the lower fragment well forwards for the restoration of the Fig. 493.FRACTURES OF THE RADIUS AND ULNA. 403 natural aspect of the carpal surface and the concavity of the radius.” (p. 24, ‘ Gordon on Fractures of Radius,’ &c., 1875.) Colies’s fracture, according to Dr. Gordon, being “ caused by the fall upon the palm of the hand, the fall forcing the hand backwards, putting the anterior carpal ligaments and flexor tendons violently on the stretch, wrenching off by the “ cross-breaking strain” the lower end of the radius, tilting it backwards, with alteration of the aspect of its carpal surface, and the bearing of the carpus upon it, leaving a gap between the fragments in front” (p. 14). The forearm should be well supported by a sling. After this form of fracture, the wrist-joint rarely recovers its normal movement, some deformity permanently remaining, and of this the patient ought to be warned. I have recently, however, had under care (June, 1878) a case of double compound Colies’s fracture, in which a recovery took place without any deformity. Fractures of the ulna are almost always the result of direct violence, Of the ulna, the middle and lower parts of the shaft—the thinner portions—usually suffering. In these cases, there is, as a rule, little displacement, and Symptoms of when it exists it is of the lower fragment. On manipulation, crepitus fractured is usually present with local pain. Fracture of the olecranon process is a very frequent accident from a fall or blow upon the elbow, or a sudden action of the triceps. In it, there is always more or less dis- Of olecranon, placement of the end of the process, and the smaller the piece the greater the displacement, the base of the process being held well in position by the fascia covering the bone and the periosteum. Fracture of the coronoid process (Guy’s Museum, 1119s8), with or without dislocation of the ulna backwards has also been described; though very rare. In the case from which Fig. 495 was taken, it co-existed with fracture of the head of the radius. The styloid process of the ulna may likewise be broken and displaced forwards or backwards, and is generally caused by a fall upon the hand. Treatment.—In fractures of the shaft the treatment is simple, the Treatment, radius acting as a splint and preventing shortening. The surgeon has only to see that the broken bone is kept quiet, and that the frag- ments are in position. This is well done by means of well-padded anterior and posterior splints, the hands being fixed in a position mid- way between pronation and supination. In fractures of the coronoid process, the forearm should he kept flexed to relax the hrachialis auticus muscle which is inserted into it; and in fractures of the olecranon, nearly straight, to relax the triceps, through which the separation of the fragments takes place. The splint may be strapped on or fixed by strapping, and, in severe cases, an immoveable apparatus is advisable. Some separation of the fragments very frequently remain after frac- ture of the olecranon, which increases when the arm is used too soon, the power of the arm being consequently weakened. Passive movement of the arm, however, should always be permited about five weeks after the accident, all violent efforts being condemned. Fracture of both radius and ulna occurs about as frequently as of both fracture of the ulna alone, hut not a quarter so often as fracture bones, of the radius. Direct violence is the usual cause, a fall upon the Cause, hand being more commonly followed by fracture of the radius than of the two bones.404 FRACTURES OF THE BONES OF HAND. Treatment. Of carpal. Of metacarpus Malgaigne lias recorded instances of this accident from muscular action. In infants, the “ green-stick” or “ incomplete” fracture of both bones is not infrequent. The fracture may be transverse, oblique, or comminuted, and the displacement of the fragment may vary vastly according to the direc- tion and violence of the force which produced it. These fractures are readily made out, and not often difficult to manage, although at times the surgeon’s ingenuity is taxed to prevent deformity. Under all circumstances, the forearm should be flexed, and the hand kept in the semi-prone position. Two wide splints should be employed, well padded, broad, and coming down to the roots of the fingers, the surgeon so arranging his pads as to prevent deformity and to neutralise the peculiar tendency of the fracture. When the parts are bandaged too tightly, the bones maybe pressed together and consolida- tion takes place as a whole, with consequent loss of motion, or the two hones may be braced together by some bony isthmus (Fig. 494). Under all circumstances, the fracture should be put up with the hand supi- nated, the dorsal splint being first applied and then the palmar, the forearm being semi-flexed. When fracture of the radius and ulna takes place above the wrist-joint, the symptoms may simulate those of dislocation; hut the greater mobility of the lower ends of the bones, crepitus, and local pain, ought to forbid the error being acted upon. Fracture of the carpal bones can only occur from direct violence, some crushing force being the usual form. It may be difficult to diagnose, as the same force that produced the fracture to a certainty will have injured the soft parts around the hones. Happily, however, the treat- ment of any severe injury to the wrist should be such as will serve for all; for the application of an anterior splint, as well as cold lotions and absolute rest of the injured part, ought always to be observed in all clear as in doubtful cases, and with these a good result may generally be secured. Fracture of the metacarpal bones is not rare. It is commonly caused by some blow when fight- ing or other form of direct violence. It is rarely complicated with any displacement. In young subjects, the head of the bone or epiphysis may be displaced. It should be treated as all frac- tures, “ with brains,” the pads and splints being so applied as to fulfil the wants of the indi- vidual case. In the majority, a simple pad placed on the palm with an anterior splint may be sufficient. In one case, Malgaigne’s plan of placing a thick compress under the head of the bone, and a second over the dorsal projection with two broad splints across the hand may be called for. In another, Sir A. Cooper’s, of binding the flexed fingers over a ball, may fulfil the necessary requirements; but, as a rule, an anterior splint and palmar pad carefully adjusted, supplies every want and is sufficient, the surgeon remembering that the palmar surfaces of these metacarpal as well as phalangeal bones are concave. Fracture of the phalanges is usually compound, although it may Fig. 494 Radius and ulna con- solidated after fracture. Prep. m9«>.COMPOUND FRACTURES OF ARM. 405 be simple, and is easily diagnosed and readily treated. A simple anterior Of phalanges, splint is all that is required, a dorsal being rarely called for; a piece of wood serving for the purpose, though a thin piece of perforated zinc is preferable. The splint should be fixed on with strapping, a coating of the compound tincture of benzoin rendering all firm and immoveable. In compound fracture into the elbow-joint when the parts are much Compound injured, excision, probably, is the wisest step to adopt, as by it con- fracture into valescence is hastened and a good arm with a moveable joint as a rule, elbow-joint, given ; whereas a recovery by natural processes without operation, will probably end with anchylosis after a tedious process of suppuration. When the injury, however, is not severe and the patient young, ex- cision is not called for, a recovery with a moveable joint being pos- sible. I have had several excellent examples of this under my care during the last few years. In aged subjects, however, amputation may be required; and in the one from which the preparation (Fig. 495) was taken, such a step was demanded. The drawing illustrates an uncom- mon form of accident—comminuted fracture of the head of the radius and fracture of the coronoid process. Fig. 495. FrG. 496.

It was introduced to our notice by Mr. William MacCormac (Pig. 497). The cushion may be described as triangular and wedge-shaped. At its thickest end it measures four inches in depth, and from this point gradually thins down for a length of fourteen or fifteen inches. The elbow rests on the thick eud, while the thin rests on the side of the chest. The cushion is readily fast- Fm. 497. ened in its place by a tape round the neck and the body; and when this simple apparatus is applied, the arm rests beautifully sup- ported and in excellent position. Whilst lying in bed nothing beyond the irdinary dressings are re- quired for the wound, and, of the patient has to be transported from one place to another, or is fit to walk about, this can be arranged with the utmost facility, as cushion, arm and all cau be bound by a broad bandage to the body and thus form an immoveable whole. Stromeyer considered this cushion to be “ the most valuable appliance he had invented during his life.” I have used it for fracture and dis- location of the humerus and shoulder-joint disease, with great advantage, and have adapted straps to it to hold the arm and forearm in position. Compound dislocation and fracture of the phalangeal joints require a distinct consideration, and the slight constitutional symptoms which such injuries induce, enable the surgeon to treat them on purely local considerations. To dwell on the importance of the integrity of the hand as a whole, or to adduce arguments to show the necessity of saving as much as possible of the thumb and fingers is unnecessai’y, since these rules of practice are now acknowledged; yet such have their limit, as anchylosis of some of these joints may prove an impediment rather than an advantage to the free use of the haud, and, while a stiff finger to a man in one business may be most detrimental, in another, if bent it may be of service. juumu no With the thumb, however, the above rule may be considered abso- preserved at lute, and an attempt should invariably be made to save the joints and all hazards. as much as possible of the injured parts ; it being often better in com- pound fractures to leave the bone to granulate than to remove it, for the use which may be made of the stump of a thumb, or of one fixed by anchylosis, can only be appreciated by those who have beeu fortu- nate enough to witness such instances. cushion (from Mac straps applied.

In a general point of view, a stiff metacarpo-phalangeal joint to a the angle at labouring man is an impediment, while to a gentleman it may be of ;g service, and at the same time preserve the comeliness of the part. A gj^ptake stiff first phalangeal joint will be most prejudicial in some trades, while place, in others it is of slight importance. A stiff joint between the extreme phalanges is rarely of much moment. The patient, however, should be consulted by the surgeon in all these cases, and the treatment moulded to the wants of the individual; since a position that may be good for one may be bad for another, and no one position is applicable to all. It is too common to find men applying at London hospitals to have fingers removed that have been saved, but fixed at bad angles; the stiff finger being an impediment to the free performance of their trade. In compound fractures and dislocations of the thumb, loose frag- Compound ments of bone should be removed and joints excised; as much as possible of the soft parts should be saved, and the wound left to natural c 1 1 *' processes for repair. To amputate a thumb for injury ought to be a very rare operation. In these injuries to the fingers the same principles of practice should be adopted, although modified by the wants of the individual case. To save a finger, and to amputate it months after Of the on account of some stiffness of joint or malposition is to waste tingeis. time. When a joint has been opened, and anchylosis must be looked for after a natural recovery, the propriety of making the attempt should be discussed before the practice is decided upon, when, if the decision be in favour of a conservative practice, the injured parts should be adjusted and fixed by means of a splint in the most favorable position. In most subjects, the straight is a forced and inconvenient position, Straight and not that ever assumed by nature, with the hand at rest. The best position not is the slightly bent, when the thumb and fingers can touch at their tips, t,ie or that which the hand naturally assumes when at rest. In exceptional cases, however, exceptional positions may be required. I have for years acted upon this principle, and always with advantage. The best splint for fingers is a piece of perforated zinc. It is thin, zinc splint, and can be bent to the required curve without trouble, as well as readily fixed on with stapping or lint saturated in tincture of benzoin. FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Fractures of the Pelvis as of the cranium, spine, and thorax, are of Fraolures of importance, inasmuch as the visceral contents are involved, but when pelvis, no such complications exist, the injury is, comparatively, not dangerous. Fracture and dislocation of the bones commonly occur together, and may be regarded as alike in a clinical point of view. The anterior portion of the crest of the ilium is not rarely Of crest, broken from direct violence, and the accident is not serious. Rest in bed to keep the abdominal muscles quiet, and the application of a pad with strapping, or a broad pelvic belt when displacement exists, are the ordinary surgical means required.

In many, the injury will he complicated with some laceration of the urethra. In the case of a female, set. 30, which I had under care, the bones were displaced on the right side for more than an inch, when a curious deformity resulted; the pelvic hones with the adductor muscles being curved out, leaving a hollow on the inner side of the thigh. In another, sent to me by Dr. Bennett, of Builth, in a female child, great separation of Fig. 498. the pelvic bones was pre- sent, the whole pelvic organs having been press- ed out of the outlet of the pelvis by the crushing force. The large intes- tine for about a foot, uterus, bladder, &c., were all in view, the whole perinseum having been ruptured. The drawing (Fig. 498) shows the child’s condition when I saw her fourteen months after the accident. H ow the child escaped with life was a mystery, the pe- rinfeum being gone, the bowels protruding, and the bones of the pelvis widely apart. Such a case is enough to show how great an injury the pelvis may occasionally sustain without causing death. As an example of fractured pelvis. Fig. 499 may be referred to. The greatest care is ne- Fig. 499. cessary in examin- ing the subject of a suspected frac- ture of the pelvis, yet the diagnosis can generally be made from the nature of the force employed, its direction, and the complications that exist. Urethral complication is the most common in the male, and ought to be treated as already described at page 150, Vol. II. As an illustration of the practice there recommended, in June, 1875, a boy, set. 7, was admitted under my care into Guy’s Hospital with fracture of the pubic bones and lacera- tion of the urethra, accompanied with profuse haemorrhage and retention, for which catheterism was ineffectual, and death seemed imminent. I consequently made a free incision into the perinaeum Fracture of pelvis. Prep. No. 1134, Guy's Hosp. Mus.409 FRACTTJKES OF THE ACETABULUM.

Under all circumstances, the utmost quiet must be enforced, for if the surgeon is unable to restore the frac- tured bones to their normal position, at any rate, he must do nothing to render their displacement greater, or increase the risk of visceral injury. Where support by means of a bandage, strapping, or casing of gutta percha or some other substance gives comfort or seems called for, it should be applied; but, in general, absolute rest, and such treat- ment as the complication may require, are all that is necessary. In two cases, I have seen obstruction of the iliac artery associated with Obstruction fracture of the brim of the pelvis; in one, the vessel was so stretched ot,iliac as to cause laceration of its inner and middle coats and obstruction, y‘ which was followed by gangrene of the corresponding limb. In the other the obstruction lasted three weeks, when pulsation returned and the patient recovered. Fracture of the acetabulum, from the head of the femur being driven Fracture of against the bone, has Been recorded. Earle, in the nineteenth volume of acetabulum, the ‘ Med.-Chir. Trans./ adduced a case in which the pelvis was broken into its three anatomical portions. Sir A. Cooper and Travers have recorded others. Moore, also, in the thirty-fourth volume of the same transactions, has given another with a drawing as figured here (Fig. 500). When the head is driven into the pelvis, as illustrated in the drawing, there will be deformity of the hip, ina- bility to move the limb, with pain in the attempt, and crepitus. Tra- vers believed that acute pain on pressure upon the projecting spine of the pubes, and inability on the part of the patient to maintain the erect posture after pelvic injury, are diagnostic of fissure of the acetabulum. A fracture of the lip of the acetabulum is probably present in such cases of dislocation of the hip as become displaced again after reduction ; the head of the bone, having nothing to restrain it, slipping out of its cup. In these cases, the reduction of the dislocation is usually attended with crepitus fol- lowed by re-dislocation on the removal of the extending force. It should be treated by fixed extension as in fracture of the thigh-bone and some circular pelvic pressure. This accident is more frequently Associated associated with dislocation of the head of the femur backwards than w’ith with any other. backward Fracture of the sacrum may be regarded clinically as that of the di8‘ocation- pelvis, but is always the result of direct violence.

Mr. Lons- dale, however, tabulated all cases at the Middlesex Hospital for six years, and finding that 516 examples of fracture of the lower extremity took place to 764 of the upper, proved that fractures of the upper extremity are 50 per cent, more frequent than those of the lower. Fractures of the femur may be divided into those of the neck or upper end, of the shaft, and of the lower or condylar end. > Fracture of the neck or upper end existed in 44 out of 217 consecutive cases admitted into Guy’s, or in one fifth of all cases. It is more frequent in the old than in the young, probably from the impaired nutrition of the bone, the cortex in the aged being always thinner and the cancelli larger. I have, however, seen it in a hoy, ait. 12, and a man, ait. 27. Stanley and Hamilton have recorded examples at even an earlier age. In Guy’s Museum there is a specimen taken from a child set. 9. (Prep. 1184.) When the fracture takes place near the head of the bone it has been called intra-capsular (Fig. 504), when near the trochanters, extra- capsular (Figs. 501-2)—terms that for practical purposes ought to be relinquished. Both forms may be impacted, and in Fig. 505 both are seen together. The best division of fractures of the neck of the femur seems to be into the impacted and unimpacted, the old division of intra- and extra- capsular fracture being as unscientific as it is unpractical. Fractures of the baseoi the neck are almost always impacted at their origin, and become unimpacted from some dislodgment of the impacted fragments, or comminution of the bone (vide Figs. 475, 501, 2). Fractures of the narroiopart of the neck may be impacted, but more commonly are unimpacted from the first. This form of fracture is more properly called intracapsular than any other (Fig. 504). In rare examples a double impaction of the head and neck of the bone is found (Fig. 505). Sir A. Cooper recognised this to a degree, though he did not quite see its importance, when, in describing fractures of the upper part of the thigh-bone, he wrote “ the fracture is placed at the root of the neck of the tliigh-bone, the trochanter is split, and the neck of the bone is received into its cleft. It frequently happens in this injury that the fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone is complicated with an injury of the trochanters, major and minor; the neck of the thigh- bone is forced at times into the cancelli of the major trochanter.” To the late Professor R. W. Smith, of Dublin, the thanks of the pro- fession are unquestionably due for having given prominence, to this class of cases, and in his valuable work on Fractures in the vicinity of joints, published in 1850, will be found nearly all that is known about the subject. I am fully prepared to endorse his opinions, and agree with him, that all extra-capsular fractures are, in the first instance, also impacted fractures.” I believe, moreover, that many so-called intra-capsular fractures and all mixed forms are primarily oi a like kind, and “ that it depends principally upon the violence with which the injury has been inflicted whether the neck of the bone shall remain implanted between the trochanters, or whether these processes shall be so completely separated from the shaft of the femur as to allow411 FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. of the escape of tlie cervix from the cavity which it had formed m the reticular tissue of the lower fragment. If the force had not been veiy great the neck of the femur remains wedged in between the trochan- ters, and one or both of these processes are split ofi from the shaft; and if the fibrous structures around the neck of the bone and trochan- ters have not been injured, these broken portions of the trochanters are still held firmly in their places, and the cervix does not become loosened (Fig. 501); but if the force has been considerable, the im- pulse prolonged, the bone in a state of senile atrophy, or if, as fre- quently happens, the patient in endeavouring to rise falls a second time, then, under these circumstances, the trochanters are not only broken from the shaft of the femur, but are so far displaced and separated from their connection with the soft parts that the cavity or socket, as it were, into which the superior fragments has been Fig 501.

Should an412 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Symptoms.

As a consequence of this violence, the impacted bones to a certainty will be loosened, if not worse disturbed, and the case will be changed from one in which the bones were placed favourably for union and recovery, into another in which a very different set of circumstances has to be encountered and a less favourable prognosis has to be given. Happily, however, the diagnosis of these cases is not difficult, and the symptoms that indicate the presence of an impacted or non- impacted fracture are fairly characteristic. They may be given as follows :—A blow or fall upon the trochanter, followed by more or less complete loss of power in the limb, a variable degree of shortening, a fixed, everted, inverted, or straight position of the foot, which moderate extension will not rectify, and when the impaction is great, an approximation of the great trochanter to the median line of the Fig. 502a.

The head of the bone will rotate in the acetabulum, and the trochanter with it, the rotation, however, of the trochanter taking place through an arc of a circle of which the head of the bone is tbe centre, instead of upon the axis of the shaft as in detached fracture of the neck. There will be indistinct or no crepitus. Local pain will always be felt on pressure behind the trochanter, and local thickening within a few days of the accident. When from the direction of the force applied to the trochanter the posterior wall of the neck is driven into the inter-trochanteric line, the limb will be rotated outwards and the foot everted ; and, when the anterior wall is driven into the bone, there will be inversion of theFRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 413 limb. The former form of accident is far more common than the latter, on account of the greater thinness of the posterior wall. To make out the existence of shortening of the neck of the thigh- bone and its amount, the following “ test line” may be employed. I, as well as my dressers, have used it for many years, and found it of great value; indeed, as a proof of its use I may add that twenty-four con- secutive cases of fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone admitted into my wards to the end of 1877 (the average age of the patients being 74) left the hospital with union of the broken bones and useful limbs. The diagnosis of all these cases had been made by means of the test line I Fig. 503. The ilio-femoral rectangle A C B. C B test line for fracture or shortening of the neck of the thigh-bone. now describe, and with the gentlest manipulation. (‘ Lancet,’ January 22nd, 1876.) For purposes of demonstration I have described it as the base of the ilio-femoral triangle (C B, Fig. 503), the two sides of the triangle being made up of two lines drawn from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, one of them, A C, being vertical, and traversing the outside of the hip to the horizontal plane of the body; and the second, A B, impinging on the tip of the trochanter major and corresponding in the normal condition of the hip-joint to the anterior half of Nekton’s test line for dislocation of the head of the femur backwards. The “ test-line ” C B for fracture or shortening of the neck, joins the two at right angles to the vertical line, and extends from it to the trochanter. Any shortening of this line, on comparing it with the same taken on the uninjured side, indicates with precision a shortening of the neck of the thigh-bone ; and, when the shortening has followed at once upon an injury, fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, impacted or otherwise, is certain. Compared with this line, all other measure- ments are uncertain. By its use, manipulations of the injured limb are often rendered unnecessary. For practical purposes, the vertical line A C and the test line C B are alone required. To compare the two sides of the body it is neces- sary to see that the pelvis is straight. The symptoms thus described, taken as a whole, may be looked upon as pathognomonic of an impacted fracture; for, although there are other injuries to the hip-joint which may give rise separately to many of the symptoms detailed, there are none in which all or most are Test line for fracture.

There is no injury to the liip-joint in which the head of the femur rests and can he made to rotate in the acetabulum and in which immediate shortening is ever found, with the exception of a fracture; and there is no form of fracture that occurs under like cir- cumstances, with the exception of the impacted, that is not accompanied by crepitus that can be readily detected, with complete eversion of the foot, marked shortening, and loss of power over the limb. These points are well brought out in a paper in the ‘ Med. Times ’ of 1869, in which I gave a careful analysis of fourteen cases. Fio. 504. Fig 605. Intra-capsular fracture of llie neck of femur.

When sudden increase in the amount of shortening takes place some days after an injury to the hip, the separation of the impacted hones and the drawing up of the lower fragment should he suspected, and, when some gradual shortening follows, it signifies the absorption of the injured neck of bone. The eversion of the limb as found in the non-impacted fracture is due to the simple weight of the broken limb, aided by the action of the powerful external rotator and possibly of the adductor muscles. The position of the limb in the impacted fracture, whether slightly everted, straight, or inverted, is determined by the impaction of the anterior or posterior wall of the neck, and by the fact, that the foot will he fixed by the impaction in the position in which it existed at the time of the accident. In non-impacted fracture of the narrow end of the neck or true intra-capsular fracture, there is usually more shortening than in the fracture of the base; this symptom depending in both of these cases upon the amount of separation of the fibrous covering of the broken bone. In the former, crepitus is also less distinct. In both these forms the shortening will he made to disappear by extension, whilst in the impacted, in any of its varieties, no such effect will be produced by ordinary force. It can only he by carelessness that a contused hip is mistaken for a fractured thigh, impacted or otherwise. I have, however, known this error to he committed. “ The practical importance of readily identifying this fracture,” writes Bigelow in his valuable monograph on the hip, “ lies in the415 fkactuk.es of the femur. fact that its progress, as regards both time and good union, is in general more favourable than that of the uuimpacted fractures; that though it is a comparatively common and disabling accident, it may exhibit little deformity; and, lastly, that the object of extension in its treat- ment is to steady the limb, and not to draw it down.” Tkeatment.—If it were as distinctly understood as it should be by Treatment, all students and practitioners that a fracture of the neck of the thigh- bone can be diagnosed without seeking for crepitus, that all but the gentlest manipulation of an injured hip is likely to prove injurious, and that any attempt to elongate the limb by forcible extension, to flex it or to rotate it with the view of restoring it to its natural posi- tion is likely to be followed by a breaking up of the impacted bones and consequently by irreparable injury, the treatment of these cases would be as satisfactory in its results as it is simple, and our work- houses be occupied with fewer cripples. Every case of fracture of the neck of the femur,, impacted or non-impacted, intra- or extra- capsular, in the young, middle-aged, or old, should be treated as if repair and union were sure to take place if the parts are kept at rest and in apposition; and, in the large proportion of cases, the hopes of the surgeon will not be disappointed. In the impacted fractures, union ought to be looked for if the broken fragments are left alone and not loosened by a careless or too curious manipulation. In the purely intra-capsular fracture, union may take place, osseous in many cases, fibrous in more. In a few there will be none, owing to a total separa- tion of the head of the bone from its attachments, or to the feeble power or age of the patient, or because the broken fragment receives too little nourishment to allow of sufficient reparative material being poured out, or because the fractured bones have not been kept suffi- ciently at rest and in apposition. Under these circumstances the head of the femur will he loose in the acetabulum with its broken surface smoothed into a cup-shaped cavity, where the rounded end of the broken neck of the femur plays as in a false joint. In the impacted fractures, the limb ought simply to be kept at rest, Of impacted and this object is attaiued by means of the double splint. fractures. In the non-impacted, extension is to be more thoroughly employed, the limb being brought down to a level with its fellow, and'maintained there by means of the long side splints and the use of weights (Fig. Splints. Fig. 506. Long splint, with weights for extension in fracture of the neck of the thigh-hone. 50G); or by what is preferable, the elastic extension as applied with Value of the double splint (Fig. 507), in which both limbs are kept parallel, double splint.Double inclined plane.

With this splint no Fig. 507. Double splint for fracture of the shaft or neck of the thigh-bone and hip-disease. perineal band is required if the foot of the bed is raised two or three inches. It is as valuable for fracture of the thigh-bone as for disease of the hip-joint. Sir A. Cooper’s plan of placing the patient on a double inclined plane has few advantages when union is to be looked for, and even the broad well-padded belt which he applied round the pelvis in order to keep the broken fragments closely together cannot be recommended; still, where the long splint cannot be worn the inclined plane may be substituted. In the impacted fracture no perineal pad is wanted, as no extension is required. In the non-impacted, where it is used, care must be observed that it is well applied and well padded, particularly in aged subjects; an india-rubber perineal tubular band being better than a leather one. When the necessary confinement to the supine position cannot be tolerated and bed-sores appear, it may be necessary to give up the long splint, and, under these circumstances, it is wise to fix the hip, pelvis, and thigh, in some strong immoveable casing similar to that employed in hip disease (Fig. 552), the limb being kept extended by means of weights attached to the foot during the setting of the material. The casing may be of leather, felt, perforated zinc, or flannel, with starch, or gum and chalk. To allow the patient to get up without any apparatus is not only to give up all hope of a cure by union, but adds to the local irritation, as the broken fragments will grate against one another and irritate the soft parts around, often causing severe local and constitutional disturbance. Under all circumstances, however, immobility of the broken bone is to be ensured. Interstitial absorption of the neck of the bone is sometimes met with after fracture, and in Fig. 508 the fact is well illustrated, the neck of the bone having almost entirely disappeared, as will be seen at once on comparing a section of tbe injured bone with that of the uninjured, from the same subject (Fig. 509). It is said also to take place after a contusion without any fracture in osteo-artbritis j how far it may occur otherwise is an open question. My own impression is that in all such cases some fracture existed, though it is difficult to prove the truth of such an opinion. The question requires further elucidation.FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 417 Fractures through the trochanter occasionally occur. Sir A.

Fracture of the Shaft of the Femur. This may take place in any part, but is more common in the centre than elsewhere, and, as a consequence, of indirect violence; it may occur, however, as a result of direct force, and more rarely of muscular action. From this cause I have seen it from the swinging of the limb over the side of a cart in the act of descending, and, in an epileptic patient, from the spasm of the muscles, with the patient in bed. I have known it also to take place from the same cause when cancer of the bone existed. The fracture may be transverse, oblique in any direction, dentated, comminuted or impacted, the nature of the force and its direction determining these points; a sharp blow is likely to be followed by a transverse fracture; a crushing force by a comminuted one; an in- direct fracture probably will be oblique, according to the natural bend in the lower part of the limb. In the middle of the bone, a lateral obliquity is the most common, in the lower third, an obliquity from behind forwards. Fractures may also be double in the same bone or compound. In the case illustrated (Fig. 512) the fracture was im- Fig. 512.

It occurred in a patient under my care in 1876, set. 83, from a fall down an area upon his knee. The man died on the 29th day. from kidney disease. (‘ Path. Soc. Trans.,’ vol. 29,1878.) The displacement that takes place turns much upon the line of the DispUce- obliquity and the position of the fracture. In fracture below the lesser trochanter, the upper fragment is prone to be drawn forward by the action of the psoas and iliacus muscles, and outward by the external rotators. In fractures above the condyles, the lower fragment is apt to be drawn backward by the unantagonised action of the gastrocnemii muscles. In fractures of the centre of the shaft, the deformity depends on the line of obliquity. Rotation outwards of the lower fragment is found in nearly every case. There is usually no difficulty in diagnosing a fracture of the shaft, the Diagnosis, following symptoms being usually present:—A fall or injury, followed by loss of power in the lfrnb; shortening, which extension can rectify; deformity, probably angular; extra mobility of the lower part of the injured limb; crepitus; and probably the projection of one end of a fragment with eversion of the foot. When the fracture is trans- verse, the shortening will rarely be marked; when it is oblique, the direction of the angular deformity often indicates the line of the obliquity. In young children where the fracture is incomplete, shortening with bowing of the limb after an accident, and an indistinct sensation of yielding on manipulation, with or without a peculiar crackling sensa- tion, indicate the nature of the accident. Treatment.—The fragments haviug been carefully adjusted by Treatment, means of extension and gentle manipulation, the mechanical treatment of these fractures consists in the maintenance of extension by means of some applied force and the complete rest of the co-apted bones; gentle compression of the affected part being sometimes beneficial. To assist the surgeon towards these ends, some anaesthetic may be used if the pain be severe and it is impossible by other means to keep the patient at rest, and any spasmodic action of the muscles interferes with the surgeon’s aims. The means adopted for these ends vary considerably, according to the fancy of the surgeon and the fashion of the school. Thus, in hospitals where the Scotch influence is great, Liston’s long splint is the usual Liston’s one employed, which should extend well up into the axilla, and several sP'iat. inches below the foot (Fig. 506, without foot-piece). It ought to be well padded and supplied with a soft perineal band, such as a leather strap, or a piece of india-rubber tubing. The ankle and instep should he well protected from pressure by cotton-wool, and the retaining bandage applied with equal pressure. At Guy’s, where the long splint has been for years employed, Desault’s Desault’s splint, with a foot-piece (Fig. 525), and the addition of a cross- ^^dlfied bar for steadiness has been more generally preferred, although within the last few years it has given way to the double one (Figs. 507, 550). Double The splint may be of wood or metal, and made with a slide so as to splint, be adjusted to different patients. In fractures of the upper third, where the upper fragment is apt to tilt forward and be rotated outwards, the double inclined plane is often Double in- of great value. It should be employed, however, only when the long splint cliued plai,e-420 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Back’s method by weights. Cripps’ splint- fails to fulfil the objects the surgeon has in view. It is daily dropping out of use. Gurdon Buck’s method of applying extension to the limb by means of weights has found great favour of late years, and is doubtless very good and simple, the counter-extending force being applied by means of a perineal band of india-rubber tubing fastened to the head of the bedstead or splint, while the limb is steadied by means of long sand bags applied laterally, or short thigh splints. This plan, how- ever, has the disadvantage of not preserving sufficient immobility of the broken bones, and ought, therefore, only to be employed in con- junction with the long splint. A very excellent splint has been suggested by Mr. Cripps, in which extension and counter-extension are kept up by a carefully regulated elastic force, and I have used it with great advantage. The perineal pad, however, must be a thick and yet a soft one. The whole thing is figured below (Fig. 513). I prefer, however, the double splint (Fig. 507). Fig 513. Mr. Cripps’ splint, showing value of elastic extension. A splint full of promise was introduced in 1875 into practice at Guy’s Hospital (Fig. 514) from the Marine Hospital, Greenwich, Fig. 514. Dr. J. llodgen’s suspension splint, as used at (i uy s.FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 421 where Mr. Johnson Smith informs me he has employed it in thirty cases since 1870 with good results. It is a modification of one in- vented by Dr. J. T. Hodgen, of St. Louis, U.S. (* Treat, on Mil. Surg.,’ by F. H. Hamilton, 1865, p. 411), for gunshot fractures, and is made of galvanized iron wire (No. 2). In it the injured limb may Hodden’s be supported on a piece of flannel, which is slung to the iron rod, or, splint, upon pieces of bandage. Extension is kept up by means of the strapping attaching the foot of the injured limb to the lower cross-bar of the splint, and through the suspending cords and pulleys. The counter-extension is maintained by the weight of the limb above the fracture and weight of the body. The splint, as seen in Fig. 514, is most comfortable to the patient, and an old house surgeon, Mr. J. F. Fry reports (‘ Guy’s Gazette,’ Dec. 11, 1875) that out of seventeen cases of fracture of the thigh Its success, consecutively treated with the splint, the average amount of shorten- ing was less than half am inch, and that in six cases there was not any. I have found, however, after a lengthened trial of this splint, that a much larger amount of callus is thrown out about the seat of fracture than is met with when the bones are kept perfectly at rest, and as they are by the double splint (Fig. 507), and conclude from this fact that Double there is more mobility of the ends of the broken bone by the one form 8Pkat. of treatment than by the other. Under such circumstances, I have dis- carded Hodgen’s splint in the treatment of fractures of the thigh for the double, which is as efficient in its action as it is comfortable to the patient. I have treated with this splint consecutively 31 cases. Statistics of. and in 18 there was no shortening, in 10 there was less than half an inch, and in only 3 was there an inch. These results are far better than those reported by Mr. Fry as having been secured by Ilodgen’s. Hodgen’s splint should not be confounded with Nathan Smith’s, which is made of wire applied to the anterior surface of the frac- tured limb, which is suspended to it by rollers (Fig. 531). When the fracture is compound, an interrupted splint may be em- ployed. In addition to the long splint, short additional splints applied in front, or the inner side of, or behind the thigh as the want of the individual case may suggest, are of great value to ensure greater steadiness of the broken bone. In no case should the seat of fracture be covered in. The bandage should stop below, and, if necessary, recommence above it. To prevent the bandage slipping after it has been applied, it is a good plan to give it one coating of paste or glue. Many modifications of these means might be mentioned. Thus, Fig. 515. Mr. Campbell de Morgan’s splint, with elastic extension. Paget has very generally employed Busk’s long splint, in which a joint exists opposite the hip, which enables the patient, after union has taken422 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Dp Morgan's plan. In infants. Vertical extension. Immoveable bandage. place, to sit up without affecting the thigh-bone. Mr. C. de Morgan, of the Middlesex Hospital, applies the extension to the fractured limb by means of a force carried from the foot through a pedal cross-bar to a long splint applied to the opposite one (Fig. 515). This splint is good for fracture as well as for disease or for excision of the hip-joint. Sir W. Fergusson was wont to apply his counter- extension from a strong stay of jean, carefully fitted to the upper third of the opposite thigh, from which a band extended in front and behind to the upper end of the splint, thus doing away with the perineal pad. During the application of the long splint, steady traction should he maintained on the injured limb by a competent assistant. When muscular spasm is severe, some surgeons have advised temporary pressure on the femoral artery in the groin. It is said to stop the spasm in all cases, and whenever I have tried it, it answered well. In infants and children under three years of age fractures of the thigh are treated with difficulty, for any immoveable apparatus is constantly dirtied from urine, faeces, &c., and requires to be changed, and the good that would otherwise be experienced is thus neutralised. On this account Paget and Callender have treated, within the last few years, many cases of fracture of the thigh in children, without splints, all apparatus being dispensed with, “the child being laid on a firm bed, with the broken limb, after setting it, bent at the hip and knee and laid on its outer side.” (‘ St. Barth. Hosp. Rep.,' 1867.) I do not recommend this practice, but would advise instead that the injured limb of the child, together with the sound one, he flexed at a right angle with the pelvis, fixed by some light splint and hoisted upwards to a cradle, hook, or bar above the bed (Fig. 516). By these means, the weight of the body acts as a constant counter-extending force, the child can he well looked to for purposes of cleanliness, and a good result may be expected. At Guy’s, we have had excellent results from this practice. Splints of gutta percha, felt, or leather may be used with the weights when they can be applied; some immoveable apparatus being adjusted after the second week; indeed, in some cases this immoveable apparatus may be applied at once, care being taken that the limb is kept well extended during its applica- tion and setting. The Bavarian flannel splint is the best (Fig. 476). In adults also, after the fourth week, this same immoveable apparatus may be employed with advantage, the patient gaining greater freedom. Some surgeons think so well of this plan as to advise its use in fracture of the thigh from the very first. Erichsen, its ablest advocate, says (‘ Science and Art of Surgery,’ p. 225), “ The starched bandage may be em- ployed in most cases. The limb should be evenly and thickly enveloped in a layer of Fig. 516. a child treated by ver- tical extension.423 FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. cotton wadding; a long piece of strong paste-board about four inches wide soaked in starch must next be applied to the posterior part of the limb from the nates to the heel. If the patient be very muscular and the thigh large, this must be strengthened, especially at its upper part, by having slips of bandage pasted upon it; two narrower strips of pasteboard are now placed one along each side of the limb, from the hip to the ankle, and another shorter piece on the forepart of the thigh. A double layer of starched bandage should now he applied over the whole with a strong and well-starched spica (Fig. 517); it should be cut up and trimmed on the second or third day and then reapplied.” With such an apparatus, Erichsen has treated many fractured thighs, both in adults and children without confinement to bed for more than three or four days, and without the slightest shortening or deformity being left. The points to be especially attended to are, that the back splint be very strong at the upper part es- pecially, and that the spica be well and firmly applied so that the hip and the whole of the pelvis be immoveably fixed. Fractures of the condyles necessarily in- volve the joint, and these may be transverse, oblique or vertical (Fig. 518). In subjects under twenty-one the lower epiphysis may he separated from the shaft, thus simulat- ing a transverse fracture (Fig. 519). These cases are serious on account of the joint complication, as some stiffness of the joint generally, but not always, follows; this result depending upon the amount of inflammatory action that takes place after the injury. When the head of the tibia is fractured into the joint, the same ob- servations are applicable. In these cases the posterior splint, as suggested by Mac- Intyre (Fig. 530), is probably the best, the knee being slightly flexed. When joint complication exists, the application of ice or, probably, some leeches may be required. In exceptional instances, the upper frag- ment of bone is driven into the lower, there- by giving rise to an impacted fracture. These cases, like other impacted fractures, generally do well by simple rest. In all cases involving joints passive motion should be allowed at the end of five or six weeks. Nathan Smith, of New York, advocates the use of an anterior splint Anterior composed of a single piece of iron wire of the thickness of a No. 11 sPlinl- catheter, which is carefully bent to the inequalities of the limb and fastened to it by means of strapping and bandages, the limb being sub- sequently suspended to the ceiling by a cord connected with the wire above and below the knee, extension being made through this cord, and the counter-extension hy so raising the foot of the bed as to tilt the body towards its head (Fig. 531.)

Prep.'1200, Guy’s Mus. and, where the bones cannot be otherwise kept in apposition it is, pro- bably, a sound practice. But what I believe to be a better one is the division of the tendo Achillis and the use of the long double splint. This operation paralyses the gastrocnemii, and thus allows the surgeon to bring the bones into a good position and to deal with them as with an ordinary fracture. I have taught this for the last twelve years, but have had only one opportunity of testing its value. It has, however, been practised in America with success. Compound fractures of the thigh. These are desperate accidents, and take place in the proportion of one to every six or seven cases of fracture of the femur, and when they occur, half the patients die. They should be treated where possible on conservative principles, and amputation should only be performed when the soft parts, with the vessels and nerves, are so injured as to forbid any reasonable hope of recovery. Conservative practice should have full scope in young subjects especially, and when any doubt upon the necessity of amputation exists, the surgeon had better de- cide upon trying to save the limb, although in the aged an opposite practice should be adopted. Army surgeons, however, advise the propriety of practising con- servatism for gunshot fractures in the upper third of the thigh, and amputation for all fractures of the middle and lower thirds; the nature of gunshot injuries to those parts precluding all hope of a natural recovery. All modern army surgeons, English, American, French, and German, agree upon this point and endorse Dupuytren’s, Hennen’s, Larrey’s, and Guthrie's opinion, that in gunshot wounds of the thigh, “ in rejecting amputation we lose more lives than we save limbs,” and “ that in the exceptional cases which result in consolidation the condition of the limb is not encouraging.” Amputation of the thigh for compound fracture is most fatal, two Fig. 519. Separation of the epiphysis. Prep. 1210« Guy’s Mus.425 FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. out of three dying. In the upper third of the thigh, the mortality is still greater. It is from this fact alone that army surgeons have advised the con- servative treatment of compound fractures of the upper part of the femur, and Mr. Erichsdn has been led to assert, that amputation in the upper third of the thigh for compound fracture is an unjustifiable operation. When amputation is not at once called for, the wound should he thoroughly cleansed and all foreign bodies with loose fragments of bone removed; the projecting portions of bone should be excised, bleeding arrested, and the wound sealed with blood or the compound tincture of benzoin, a splint should be applied at once, moderate extension employed, and the case treated on general principles, while some surgeons would inject into the wound a solution of carbolic acid (1 in 20), and under thp carbolic spray, dress it in the so-called antiseptic method. Fractures of the Patella. These are usually transverse from a sudden action of the quadriceps Fractures of femoris, under a violent effort to prevent the body falling backwards, Patella- the knee being at the time partially bent. Such fractures are met with chiefly in the centre of the bone, though they may be above or below it. “ If the fracture is very low down probably the knee was but little beut, and thus the greater part of the bone still rested on the condyles.” (Hutchinson, ‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1869.) In some cases, both patellae are broken, together or consecutively; in rarer instances, the same Multiple patella may be broken more than once. I have had such a case in a fractures, man in whom one patella had been broken twice and the other three times; and, in the Guy’s Museum, there is a preparation (Fig. 520) from my father’s museum, in which the bone had been broken transversely Fig. 520. Multiple fracture of patella. Prep. 121220. into four fragments, probably from different injuries or from some direct force, each fragment having a ligamentous union. These transverse fractures are at times, although rarely, the result May result of direct violence. The French and American surgeons believe them from direct to be so very frequently. Direct violence to the patella, however, is violence, more commonly followed by what is called a starred or vertical than a transverse fracture, and in these cases, there is rarely much separation of the fragments; in the transverse, the separation is sometimes very great, this fact depending upon the amount of muscular action at the time of fracture. This separation is greatly increased by the effusion that is so apt to take place into the knee-joint, as well as by flexing the leg, both before union has taken plaee and for many months subse- quently, and from a yielding of the ligamentous union. This separa- tion is very frequently an inch, but often more. Sir A. Cooper426 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Diagnosis. Starred and vertical fracture. Character of uniting medium.

The diagnosis of the trans- verse fracture is rarely diffi- cult, the nature of the violence, the sudden loss of power of the limb, the distinct separation of the fragments, and the bulging of the synovial sac between the divided portions of bone, being characteristic. In thz starred fracture the different pieces of bone may be made out. In the vertical, the diagnosis may be more difficult, and can be only made out by manipulation. In exceptional cases where either the ligamentum patellae or the tendon of the extensors above the patella is broken, some difficulty may be felt, but such accidents are very rare. When the transverse fracture is little more than a fissure, no separation will be found, the amount of separation being determined by the extent of laceration of the fibrous and tendinous coverings of the bone. When the laceration is partial and the separation slight, there is a better hope of a bony or close union than when the laceration is complete and the separation great, and it should be known, that union by bone may take place although pro- bably but seldom ; that union by strong ligament, with about half an inch to an inch of separation, is more common; but that non-union is not rare. William Adams, in the ‘ Path. Trans.,’ vol. xiii, informs us that, out of thirty-one specimens he examined, fifteen were examples of ununited fracture, twelve of true ligamentous union, and four doubtful. In tbe unuuited the separation was very great, in the liga- mentous, it was rarely beyond an inch and a half. In tbe ununited the separated fragments were only connected with each other by a single layer of fibrous tissue. That bone union takes place is now generally recognised. In Prep. 121175. Guy’s Museum (Fig. 522) the fact is well exemplified. The specimen has been fully described with remarks, by the late Mr. W. King, in the ‘Guy’s Hosp. Rep.,’ series i, vol. vi. In the starred or vertical fractures osseous union is generally secured, these cases being rarely attended with complete laceration of the periosteal or fibrous covering of the bone. Treatment.—In all cases, as well as in every form of fractured patella, a long well-padded posterior splint with a foot-piece extending from the tuberosity of the ischium to the foot should at once be adjusted, the knee- joint being left uncovered by the bandage. To the knee-joint, a bag of Fig. 522. Anterior surface. Vertical section. Fracture of patella united by bone. Taken from my father’s museum.427 FRACTURES OF THE PATELLA. ice or cold lotion should he applied, for, as a direct consequence of the accident blood is very apt to he effused, and as a secondary effect, synovial inflammation with effusion is almost sure to ensue. It has generally been the custom to raise the heel with a view to Elevation of destroy the action of the extensor muscles, hut it is now more gene- rally believed that no good is derived from such a measure; as a conse- quence the horizontal position of the limb is usually employed, the body being raised. The fragments should be brought together at the same time as much as possible by the fingers of the surgeon, and later on by some apparatus. To do so, however, before the joint itself has recovered from the effects of the injury, while blood exists to any ex- tent, or the synovial capsule is distended with inflammatory effusion, is not wise; since any attempt to draw the bones together under these circumstances, can only result in tilting forward the surfaces that are required to he brought into apposition, with no good effect. For a few days, therefore, until all inflammatory action has subsided, Rest, the surgeon should rest satisfied by simply pressing the parts together with his fingers, and when this result has been secured, the two por- tions may be drawn together by means of strips of plaster diagonally applied, of india-rubber bands covered with washleather attached to hooks which have been inserted at intervals of an inch on either side of the splint, or, by what is better, by means of elastic compression, as Elastic corn- shown in Fig. 523. pression.

Malgaigne’s hooks, which are composed of four claws drawn together Malgaignc’s by a screw, have been much employed, and are doubtless effectual, but kooks, from the fact that they penetrate the soft parts and painfully and for- cibly draw the broken fragments together they are objectionable. Good results have, however, been reported from their use. As soon as all inflammatory action of the joint has subsided and the Bavarian hones are fairly in position, such an immoveable apparatus as the splint, flannel Bavarian splint may be applied, the patella being left exposed or not as the surgeon may think fit. When the bone is bandaged over care must be taken not to press upon it, as I have known secondary suppuration with necrosis, and joint complication of a serious nature thus ensue. Erichsen uses, as a rule, the starch bandage and speaks highly of it. He applies it over a pad fixed above the fractured bone, with a figure-of-8 bandage. Whatever apparatus is employed, it should be kept on for five or six weeks at least, and when removed, some light leather or felt casing should he substituted. To allow the patientFRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 428 Operative interference in fracture. Compound fractures of patella. Statistics of. to flex the limb under three months is hazardous, for the united liga- ment is sure to be stretched and elongated, and the limb weakened. A good leather knee-cap should permanently be worn after this accident. With the confidence rightly or wrongly engendered by what is known as the antiseptic system, surgeons have been led to cut down upon a fractured patella and to unite the fractured fragments of bone by sutures; and, although in the case or cases in which this practice has been employed, it is a pleasure to record that no bad results followed, yet the practice cannot be recommended but rather condemned. In examples of neglected cases of fracture where a great separation of the fragments exists and the knee is consequently so weak as to be useless, such an operation may be justifiable, but, under other circum- stances, I cannot, as a teacher, regard it otherwise than as a rash and hazardous proceeding. Compound fractures of the patella. These are grave accidents, one fourth of the cases dying. Poland, in an able paper read before the Med. and Chir. Society, 1870, gave au analysis of 85 such cases, and clearly proved that in all cases we should attempt to save the limb, and adopt the ordinary treatment as for simple fractures of the patella. To this end the wound should be well washed with iodine water or carbolic acid lotion, and accurately closed by sutures, and inflammation subdued by the constant application of ice. If suppuration sets in, free incisions should be made into the joint, and amputation resorted to only, when the powers of the patient fail to repair the injured joint. Detached fragments of bone should, however, be removed at once. Out of the 85 cases collected by Poland, there were 20 deaths and 65 recoveries; in 31 of these there was more or less complete anchylosis of the joint; 20 recovered with movement, 4 were resected and 5 am- putated. The joint suppurated in 43 out of the 65 cases of recovery, and in all the fatal cases. Fractures of the Leg. Fractures of leg. Statistics. Both bones generally broken. Fracture of tibia. These are about ttvice as frequent as those of the thigh. At Guy’s, 1090 cases were admitted in six years against 541 of the thigh, and of these 202, or one fifth, were compound. Of the simple cases, not 1 per cent, died from all causes; and of the compound, 27 per cent, succumbed. Both bones, as a rule, are fractured; the fibula alone being broken in about one case in six, and the tibia in about one in seven. Lonsdale’s statistics indicate these points. These fractures are more commonly met with in adult than in child life. In fractures of both bones, those of the upper half are usually the result of direct violence, fractures of the lower half of indirect, such as the twisting of the foot or leg from a fall or jump. In fractures of the tibia alone, the line of fracture is frequently transverse, and from this cause there is sometimes difficulty in making the diagnosis; the nearer the fracture to the knee the more transverse being the line. These fractures arise chiefly from direct violence. They may so unite as to leave no external trace of injury; indeed, they .may be attended with so little displacement that the line of the bone is never429 FRACTURES OF THE LEG. Fig. 524. Of fibula alone. Pott’s fracture. broken. I have seen more than one patient walk upon the fractured limb directly after the accident, and in one case, the man went up a whole flight of stairs to his ward with hut a slight limp. In another, under care in 1874, a woman with a fractured tibia and fibula went about for a week. In a medico-legal point of view, these facts are important. When the shaft has been sepa- rated at its upper epiphysis, some arrest of growth may take place; and such a result is illustrated in Fig. 524. Fracture of the fibula is more common than that of the tibia, particularly in its lower third, and I believe in many examples of what are called bad sprains, a fracture exists. In the upper two thirds, the fracture is usually caused by direct violence; iq the lower third by indirect, such as a lateral twist of the foot. As often as not it is associated with a forcible eversion of the foot. With pedal inversion, the extremity of the tibia is mostly broken off. When with this fracture the foot is displaced outward, and its outer edge raised, the accident is known as “ Pott’s fracture ” (Fig. 465), and under these circumstances the external liga- ment remains entire, the force being concen- trated against the fibula from two to three inches above the malleolus; the internal ligament, however, is ruptured, or the inner mallelous is fractured. Displacement of the foot is not ne- cessarily an attendant upon the fracture. It seems to be the result of some continuation of the primary fracturing force or of some addi- tional force, such as that of an attempt to walk. In the indirect fracture, the line of fracture is probably oblique, the obliquity being determined by the direction of the force. Diagnosis.—In fracture of either of the leg-bones alone, the diagnosis may be somewhat difficult, and more particularly when no displace- ment is present. Crepitus may at times be made out by a forcible attempt to move or bend the lower fragments, or, by some sudden in- version or eversion of the foot, but the surgeon should be careful in trying for this not to do harm. Local pain, however, caused by pressure with the thumb over the seat of fracture, and linear ecchymosis a few days after the accident are valuable helps to diagnosis in these as in all other kinds of fracture. Protracted or repeated examinations of the injured limb should always be avoided, they only add to the mischief. Treatment.—In fractures of either of these bones, a hatnral splint Treatment is always found in the sound bone, consequently any shortening or deformity rarely follows the accident. What the surgeon has to do is, simply to apply some splint to ensure rest to the broken bone and to the muscles that move the foot—to the inside of the leg when the fibula is broken (Fig. 526), and to the outside when the tibia (Fig. 525); the splints should have a foot-piece. In fractures of the lower third of the fibula, the foot may be drawn inwards, the bandage being applied Arrest of growth in shaft of right tibia (1 inch), with bowing of fibula, following injury to up- Eer epiphysis two years efore, in child, set. 8.

In no case should the bandage cover the fracture. After the lapse of a few days or at most a week, when all swelling with other evidence of local injury has subsided, the limb may with advantage be put up in some immoveable apparatus. In cases of Pott’s fracture, or dislocation of the foot outwards with fractured fibula, Pott used to place the patient on the af- fected side, with the injured limb flexed, fixing the leg upon an outside splint; an inner splint being likewise very usually applied. A better plan, however, is found in the posterior and two lateral splints, with a swing, as seen in Fig. 529, this mode of swinging the limb being a very good substitute for Salter’s swing (Fig. 530). Fractures of both bones occur in every variety, and the most common is the transverse about three inches above the ankle, but every form of oblique, dentated, comminuted, and vertical fracture is met with (Fig. 472). When near the joints, the vertical into the joint is by no means rare. The surgeon in his first examination of the fractured limb should, if possible, make out the line of obliquity of the fracture and the tendency one or other of the frag- ments may have to ride in any one direction, always observing the utmost gentleness in his manipulation. When the tibia is broken at the junction of its middle and lower thirds, and the extremity of its upper frag- ment on its inner or subcutaneous surface presents a V-shape (Fig. 527), the surgeon may expect to find a fissure in the lower fragment of bone, starting from the apex of the V and running in a spiral direction in- wards, backwards, and outwards round the inner edge of hone, across its posterior surface towards the lower articular facet where the tibia and fibula articulate, the fissure then passing horizontally inwards across the lower articular facet of the tibia to the posterior border of the inner malleolus, to join the one on the posterior aspect of the bone, thereby cutting off a triangular fragment of the tibia at its lower extremity. This variety of fracture is generally produced by some sudden twist of the body when the foot is fixed. It may be suspected during life, when joint compli- cations are associated with the fracture. It was first de- scribed by M. Grosselin (‘ Gazette des Hopitaux,’ 1855). V-shaped frac- ture of tibia with spiral fis- sures.

When compound, it is generally of a serious nature, and, according Its serious to Gosselin, should be treated by amputation. Dr. R. M. Hodges, of nature. America, going so far as to say that by such a practice alone can the patient’s life be saved (‘ Boston Med. and Surg. Journal,’ Jan., 1877). Death usually takes place from pyaemia in cases that are left alone. I am not disposed, however, to go so far in this direction, though I fully recognise the serious nature of these cases and believe that they claim the surgeon’s anxious attention. In transverse fractures there is rarely deformity. In the oblique, it Deformity, is a common result—the upper extremity of the lower portion of bone, projecting, as a rule—the lower fragment being rotated outwards from the great tendency the foot has towards eversion. The symptoms of fractui’e of the leg are too plain to be overlooked. Symptoms. The tibia being a superficialfbone, any solution of continuity or devia- tion of the line of its spine is readily made out, the nature of the acci- dent, loss of power, deformity, and crepitus, helping the diagnosis. In fractures near the joint, it may at times be difficult to make out whether the bone is fractured into the joint or not, and when a doubt exists, caution in prognosis and treatment should be observed. In frac- tures close to the ankle accompanied with displacement, dislocation may be roughly simulated, but the slightest care ought to detect the true nature of the case; the facility with which the displacement of the parts is rectified, the fact that the malleoli retain their normal relative position with the foot, and that the ankle-joint moves with facility, proves that the displacement is due to broken bones and not to dislocation of the joint. When the lower epiphysis of the tibia Separation of is displaced with the foot, there may be some difficulty in making epiphysis, out the true state of the case, but such an accident can only occur in children; it will appear as a transverse fracture, but with no sharp edge of bone as is usual in fracture, while replacement of the displaced Fig. 528.

When a wound complicates the case, the diagnosis is readily made.432 FRACTURES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Treatment. Treatment.—It is wise, in fracture of the leg, as of other hones, to “ set ” the fracture and to put the injured limb into the right position with good splints as soon as possible. In a general way, for fractures of the lower two thirds of the bones, the best apparatus is a straight, flat, and not too broad, metal or wooden posterior splint (Fig. 528), with a rectangular foot-piece and two broad lateral splints (Fig. 529), all being well padded and firmly Fig. 529. fixed by broad strips of strapping, broad bands of inelastic webbing or bandages, the seat of fracture being left exposed, if possible, for Fig. 630. MacIntyre’s splint and Salter’s swing.FRACTURES OF THE LEG. 433 observation. In Fig. 529, the whole apparatus is illustrated with an interrupted splint as for compound fracture. In reducing a fracture of the leg, the knee should be partially flexed or held by an assistant, the surgeon manipulating the lower portion (Fig. 528). During the putting up of the fracture, the limb must be kept extended Setting, and the broken bones maintained in position, it being a good plan to fix the foot and limb at first to the posterior splint, and subsequently, to apply the lateral. The leg afterwards should be slung to a cradle by bandages (Fig. 529), or Salter’s cradle may be used (Fig. 530). When any wound in the soft parts exists as in compound fracture, the corresponding lateral splint should be interrupted, as shown in Fig. 529. When the fracture is close to the ankle-joint and any difficulty is ex- Division of perienced in keeping the broken bones in'position from the spasmodic ^°ha action of thetendo Achillis, the tendon should be divided. This simple operation at once permits the parts to be adjusted with admirable facility, and renders the retentive apparatus of real value, while it allows natural processes of repair to go on uninterruptedly, the divided tendon and broken bones undergoing repair together. When the fracture is near or into the knee, a posterior splint such as that of MacIntyre or Amesbury, may be employed; indeed, some employ this splint for most fractures of the leg (Fig. 530). In setting any fracture of the leg, the opposite limb should be exposed The sound as a guide, and an inquiry made to prevent error as to the existence limb as a of any natural or acquired deformity. The foot should generally be gu,de’ placed at right angles with the leg, with the sole flat to the foot-piece, care being observed that the heel does not fall and the lower fragment of bone consequently tilt upwards. The heel should also be well protected from pressure, and the foot covered and protected with cotton wool. “ Take, therefore,” writes Paget (‘ Lancet,’ Feb. 27, 1869), “ the footpiece of the splint as the guide for the position of the foot; and if you but see, in the management of fractures of the leg, that the foot of the patient and the foot- piece of the back splint fairly correspond, it is hardly possible for the limb to fall into any defective method of repair. Correspon- dence between the axis of the foot and of the foot-piece ensures that there shall be no rotation or version, either outwards or in- wards. Then, again, you should be careful that the foot touches the foot-piece by the three balls of the sole—the ball of the heel, the ball of the great toe, and the ball of the little toe.” Dr. Shrimpton, of Paris, acting upon Dr. Nathan Smith’s suggestion -j^g anterior of an anterior ware splint, has applied it to fractures of the leg, with wire splint, success. He employs a splint composed of double wires an inch and a half apart, held together by four transverse bars, and applied by means of straps to the front of the leg, as illustrated in Fig. 531 (‘ Lancet,’ 1872), the limb being subsequently slung in a vertical direction, as Esmarch slings his patient’s leg in disease of, or after operations upon, the ankle. After the limb has been kept in splints for about a month immoveable some immoveable apparatus such as the flannel Bavarian (Fig. 476) may apparatus, be substituted and the patient allowed to get up, moving about with crutches for another month. When there is little or no displacement and little swelling, as soon as the immediate effects of the injury have passed away the immoveable splint may be at once applied, that is, after the first week, the wants of the individual case being the only guide to VOL.

Of the os calcis. a pad, with sufficient local pressure to keep the parts in position, may be employed. When much effusion of blood or local action takes place, ice or cold lotion may be used as an application. Constitutional symptoms can be treated as they arise. Compound fractures of the leg ought to be adjusted in the same way as the simple, care being taken to have an interruption in the splint cor- responding to the wound (Fig. 529). When the wounds are extensive, the posterior hollow' splint of MacIntyre, or any of its modifications, may be used with advantage. When the bones are comminuted, the loose pieces should be re- moved, the wound cleaned and sealed with a pad saturated with blood, the compound tincture of benzoin or carbolic acid, as already described; at a later period of the case, when inflammation and suppuration take place about the seat of fracture, a free incision should be made down to the bone and any necrosed fragment removed. This operation gives relief to pain and expedites recovery. When the injury to the soft parts is great and the large vessels or . the joint are involved, amputation may be called for. About one in every three cases of fracture of the leg is compound, the average mortality of the compound being also about one in three. Of those amputated, about 60 per cent, are fatal. When amputation is called for, a primary operation, i.e. one per- formed during the first three days, is better than a later one. Fractures of the foot, commonly the result of some crushing force, are always serious on account of the injury the soft parts have sustained in common with the bones. When not so complicated, severe fractures of the bones of the foot as well as other bones will recover by rest and the application of cold lotions, &c. Fracture of the os calcis may occur by a fall from a height. It is seldom associated with any displacement, and undergoes excellent repairCOMPLICATED FRACTURES. 435 when natural processes are left to themselves. In exceptional cases, the broken fragment may be drawn up by the action of the gastrocnemii muscles, and, under such circumstances, the leg must be kept flexed and the foot extended to keep the fragments in position by some outside splint. Under these circumstances, however, the foot rarely recovers completely its natural use. Fractures of the astragalus also occur from some fall or violence and of the are often compound. I had a case some years ago, in which the astragalus, upper surface of the bone with its head was split off and forced through the skin, and a second in which the bone was crushed into fragments and extruded from below the external malleolus. In the former the soft parts were so injured that amputation was performed; while in the latter, recovery took place by natural processes with a stiff hut good limb. Simple fracture may, however, occur, and I am disposed to think it is more common than is supposed, but the injury is difficult to dia- gnose, particularly when no displacement coexists. I have had occasion in two cases to remove from boys who had acute inflammation of the bone and joint, following an injury, the whole of the necrosed upper articular surface, with half the thickness of the astragalus, and in both good results followed. The piece I removed in both instances looked as if it had been fractured, and subsequently died. I have also re- cently (1878) removed from the inner aspect of the ankle of a man, the upper half of the astragalus that had been fractured six months pre- viously, and displaced so as to present its upper articular facet in- wards. The case had been reported at a sister hospital as one of fracture of the tibia and fibula. The fractured bone had subsequently inflamed and died. Compound fracture of the metatarsal and phalangeal bones should be Compound treated on ordinary principles, the immediate dressing of the wounds 'raaure with the compound tincture of benzoin to exclude all air and place the Metatarsus wound as much as possible under the condition of a subcutaneous and one being absolutely indicated. When parts irreparably injured require phalanges, to be taken away, no healthy structures ought to be sacrificed in order to perform a named operation. COMPLICATED FRACTURES. Extravasation of Blood. Fractures are very often complicated with extravasation of Hood, Extrarasa- wlien difficulties may be experienced in deciding whether the blood lion of blood comes from an artery or a vein. In compound fracture, however, the m fracturcB- difficulty of diagnosis is less than in the simple, since the florid cliarae- Arterial ter of the flowing blood, its pulsatile stream and capability of being blood, arrested by pressure on its cardiac side, indicate its arterial source. In simple fractures, the difficulty is sometimes very great, particularly when the limb is distended with blood, and there is no pulsation in the swelling. When the vessels below the seat of injury pulsate naturally, the blood has probably a venous origin, but when pulsation is not felt, there is no reason to jump to the conclusion that arterial laceration has taken place, as tho arteries may be simply pressed upon by the effused blood. When the swelling itself pulsates the diagnosis is simplified,436 COMPLICATED FRACTURES. for such pulsation generally means that a traumatic aneurism has formed, and some large artery been ruptured. In a clinical point of view, however, the question happily is not very material, as surgeons are now tolerably well agreed as to the practice to be pursued. Treatment of Treatment.—In compound fractures the injured vessel should be tied compouud or twisted, and the wound should be enlarged for this purpose when ne- rmjtnre’of *th cessai7 > an(leven where such a practice is impossible, and from the na- an artery. ture of the fracture and condition of the soft parts it is probable that the limb may be saved, the main artery should be tied higher up, as frac- tures heal well with a diminished supply of blood. Years ago, when a Cases. student, I remember a. case of Mr. Bransby Cooper, in which a com- pound fracture of the leg was complicated with a laceration of the femoral artery, and the artery was secured at the seat of injury. Kepair went on as well in the fracture as in any case I ever witnessed. Mr. Bransby Cooper has also recorded in his ‘ Sur- gical Essays’ a case of fracture of the femur where the femoral artery was ligatured for a ruptured popliteal artery, and recovery took place in six weeks. In the autumn of 1873, a youth, set. 18, came under my care with a compound fracture of the condyles of the humerus into the elbow-joint, and an injury to the brachial artery about its centre, sufficient to arrest all circulation through it. The wound into the joint was extensive, but as my dresser had sealed it well with lint soaked in the compound tincture of benzoin before I saw it, I thought it wise to leave the case to nature. The youth went on well without one bad symptom, and left the hospital with a moveable joint, I am disposed to attribute the well-doing of this case to the fact, that the brachial artery was obstructed. When, however, the condition of the limb at the seat of fracture is such as to forbid any hope of its recovery being entertained, primary amputation ought to be performed; if a doubt exists as to the pro- ability of the limb being saved, the artery should be secured in or above the wound; and amputation should be performed as a secondary operation if the attempt fail to save the limb; the chances of a suc- cessful result in primary and secondary amputation being about equal. Of simple In simple fracture, when there is great effusion of blood and no pul- fracture. sation in the swelling or vessels, the expectant treatment is the right one to adopt, the injured limb being kept at rest and elevated, and cold applied. When pulsation in the swelling is felt, and it is clear that arterial laceration has taken place, the same practice ought also primarily to be adopted, since every hospital surgeon knows that these cases often do well under such treatment. I can recall several where it was as clear as symptoms could define that with fracture of the bones of the leg severe arterial laceration existed, and yet a good recovery ensued. To cut down at the seat of injury and secure the wounded artery is what no one at the present day advocates, although John Bell laid it down as a law, that such a rule should be fol- lowed ; but to do so above the seat of injury is one that commends itself to the surgeon’s attention, when it is clear that some treatment is requisite for the wounded vessel and that the fracture and parts around are progressing towards recovery. When gangrene of the limbCOMPLICATED FRACTURES. 437 threatens, it would be as unscientific as it is useless to adopt this practice ; amputation, under such circumstances, being alone ap- plicable. By way of summary it would appear that in compound fracture Summary, complicated with arterial hsemorrhage, the vessel ought to be secured if possible, in the wound, if not above it; and that primary or secondary amputation should only be resorted to when the local injury forbids any hope of a natural recovery being entertained. In simple fracture the expectant treatment should, as a rule, be adopted. If from the progressive character of the hsemorrhage, inter- ference is absolutely demanded, the artery should be secured above the fracture, and amputation had recourse to when gangrene of the limb follows. Pressure upon the afferent artery is a practice that also demands attention. In exceptional cases, it may be expedient to cut down upon the wounded vessel at the seat of injury. Fractures implicating Joints. These are generally grave injuries—though in simple fractures the Fractures worst effect that is usually to be looked for is some stiffness or auchy- implicating losis of the articulation. Yet this result is not constant, and a mova- joints- ble joint is not rarely secured. As a matter of precaution, however, the surgeon should warn the patient of the risk, and be careful always to adjust the fracture and limb in the most useful position for a stiff joint. Such cases require very careful treatment, absolute immobility of the injured bone and articulation being essential points to he observed; the joint, if inflamed, must be treated upon ordinary principles. Passive movement of the joint should be commenced after the lapse of four or five weeks. Compound fractures into joints are among the most serious cases Compound the surgeon has to treat, and in the lower extremity generally re- fracture into quire amputation. In the knee-joint, this practice is the best when the wound is great and fracture severe, though exceptional cases are on Into knee, record in which excision has been employed. In less severe examples an attempt to save the member may be made, secondary amputation being performed when ill-success follows. The same rules are applicable in these cases as in wounds of joints, a simple fissure of bone adding but little to the danger; while severe comminution reduces the prospects of success to a minimum. In compound fracture into the ankle-joint without displacement, no Ankle, operation is usually called for, since good results are obtainable by conservative treatment. In compound fracture of the shoulder- and elbow-joints, amputation Shoulder and is rarely required unless the parts are irreparably crushed, or the patient elbow, is so old as to forbid any hopes of recovery being entertained. Yet in many cases excision should be undertaken, as it is wiser to excise the articulation at once with the view of securing movement than to look for a recovery by natural processes where anchylosis must be expected, unless, indeed, the wound is small, the injury to the bones slight, and the patient young. In compound fracture of the wrist, no operation is required as a general rule.COMPLICATED FRACTURES. 438 Summary. By way of summary, compound fractures into joints should he regarded as cases of wounded joint, and treated accordingly, the amount of hone comminution and displacement having an important influence in determining the question and nature of operative inter- ference, when such may be called for. . In large joints, where excision is inexpedient or dangerous, amputa- tion must be had recourse to; in others, where excision is a sound operation, it should he preferred. In the ankle- or wrist-joint where the articular ends of the bones project, they should, except in young subjects, be removed. Comminution Comminution of bones is a complication that requires a few observa- tions, although in simple fractures it does little more than render difficult the treatment of the case and increase the risk of some short- ening or deformity. When, however, it is the result of a direct force from a “ spent ball,” or other projectile, the comminution may be very great, the bone also may be fissured and with the soft parts contused; the danger of the case under these circumstances being much aggravated, not only from the direct effect of the injury, but from the ostitis that is so liable to follow. In compound In compound fracture, bone comminution has, too, an important lacture. influence for harm; adding greatly to the risks and dangers of sup- puration and diminishing the probabilities of a successful result; since each piece of bone often acts as an irritant and retards recovery, and the fragments too often subsequently die. It is always well, there- fore, in these cases to remove the detached portions, and, when the extremities of the bones are rugged, to excise them. Large pieces cf hone, however, that are held by their periosteal coverings, must not be interfered with. This splitting and comminution of bone is most frequently met with in gunshot wounds, the conoidal of the present day splintering far more than the round bullet of former times. Projecting In all cases of compound fracture where difficulty is experienced in pieces of reducing the projecting ends of the broken bone, the best course is to bone. remove them with a saw, particularly when they are sharp; com- minuted fragments should also be taken away. When much bone has, however, been removed, the surgeon should be careful not to separate the parts too much, for fear of want of union. The subject of dislocation and fracture has been discussed in the chapter on dislocations. Fracture from gunshot wounds will receive attention in the chapter devoted to gunshot injuries.439 PATHOLOGY OF JOINT DISEASES. CHAPTER XXXII. DISEASES OF THE JOINTS. To assert that safe and scientific surgery can only be based on General sound pathology may appear to be a somewhat trite observation; remarks, nevertheless, it is true, so true indeed that it cannot be impressed too forcibly on all who seek or profess to practise our profession. Moreover, it should be the aim of every surgeon whose duty it is to practice and to teach, to demonstrate the truth of the assertion, and to establish his practice upon such a scientific basis. It is with this feeling that I now propose to consider the pathology of joint disease, to explain briefly the changes which the tissues undergo during inflammation, and the results to which those changes lead; setting aside for the present, disputed points of pathology, and reserv- ing for future consideration the subject of tumours involving joints. Diseases of a joint generally commence as an acute or chronic in- Qn the flammation of the bone or synovial membrane, although in the pro- primary seat gress of any case, and, of course, when disorganization of a joint has disease in taken place, both become affected; the extent, however, to which either1 tissue will be involved will depend greatly upon the seat of the original disease. When it has begun in the synovial membrane and disorgani- zation of the joint has followed, the disease in all probability will be found to have affected only the articular facets of the bones with the parts immediately beneath, and not to have involved the deeper structures. When the bones are the original seat of the mischief, and the inflammatory process has spread from them to the synovial membrane and disorganization of the joint taken place, the chief pathological changes will be seen in the osseous tissue, and either the whole or a part of the articular epiphysis, if not a portion of the shaft, will be involved in the disease. Under both circumstances, the car- tilage covering the articular facets will have disappeared. When, however, the bones are the primary seats of disease, the cartilages are shed more rapidly, as the articular cartilages derive most, if not all, of their nourishment through the bones; and, as a consequence, any per- version of nutrition and inflammatory changes of this tissue at once show themselves in the cartilages. Practically, there is no such thing as a primary disease of the arti- Ulceration of eular cartilages, no such process as so-called ulceration of cartilage, cartilage not independently of disease of other tissues. When the cartilages undergo & primary a change it is always secondary to some affection either of the synovialclisca3e- membrane, and then it is slow and partial in its action, or of the bone when it is rapid and complete. It should be remembered, however, that disease in the synovial membrane of a joint cannot exist for any time, or be of any severity without involving its ligaments, or the cellular tissue with which it is surrounded. Nor can inflamma- tory disease exist for any period in the articular extremity of a bone without more or less affecting its periosteal covering. It should be added, too, that there is good reason to believe that either bone or synovial disease may be started by a severe sprain or laceration of ligaments at their osseous or periosteal attachments.PATHOLOGY OF JOINT DISEASES. 440 On the term strumous disease of a joint. Practically it misleads. A term to he given up. Changes in the synovial membrane under inflammation. Before proceeding to consider the changes the different tissues un- dergo from the inflammatory process, it will be well to ask whether there is such a disease as strumous disease of a joint, strumous disease of the synovial membrane or bone ? If I were to answer this question according to custom as indicated by the free application of the term to joint disease, I should unques- tionably say that it was a common affection, for there are few chronic changes of a joint that are not so designated, and it is rare to meet in a delicate child with any chronic affection of a joint which is not regarded by some as a strumous disease. Indeed, from the constant use of the phrase it .might be thought, that the term strumous disease had some definite meaning or conveyed some definite idea, that the affection so designated was of a special kind, could be recognised by special features, and possessed definite pathological characteristics. Yet it can hardly be said that such is practically the case; for if we look for the points of difference between the so-called strumous disease and the chronic inflammatory affections we shall fail to find them, since they are not clinically to be distinguished, nor practically to be separated. Indeed, I am more than satisfied that the so-called strumous disease of a joint is nothing more than a chronic inflamma- tion of the bones or synovial membrane, or both; that the pathological changes in the affected tissues are such as are clearly traceable to a low form of inflammatory action, and that they differ in no single pathological point from the inflammatory changes found in other parts. It is true that such affections being of a low type, differ from other inflammatory actions of a more healthy character, but that they are nevertheless inflammatory there can be no doubt. Practically, therefore, it would be well to expunge this term “strumous” in respect of joints from our vocabulary; as its use certainly misleads, by making the student believe that the term has a definite meaning when it has not; and by encouraging the idea that the disease to which it is applied has a constitutional more than a local origin, and is con- sequently incurable. Of this, however, I am sure, that so-called strumous disease of a joint is as curable and as amenable to treatment as any other chronic inflammatory disease. In saying this, however, I do not dispute the fact that, pathologically, we do at rare intervals find tubercular deposit in some of the tissues building up a joint, and particularly in the bone; but I must repeat what I wrote many years ago in my work on diseases of the joints, “ that such preparations being so rare are to be regarded as pathological curiosities.” They are discovered also accidentally, and cannot clinically be recognised by any characteristic features from other cases of chronic inflammation of the bone. It would be well, therefore, to give up the term in scien- tific discussion, or, if it be used at all, to use it in the same sense as the words tumours, rheumatism, and fever are now employed, as a broad general term that includes many affections and covers much ignorance. With these general remarks I now pass on to consider the changes the different tissues entering into the formation of a joint undergo in the inflammatory process. On the pathological changes which take place in the synovial membrane from inflammation. In a pathological point of view, inflammation of the synovial441 PATHOLOGY OP JOINT DISEASES. membrane may show itself in two distinct ways, firstly, in change of function, and secondly, in change of structure. The first change may take place without the second, but the change of structure necessarily includes an alteration in the function. The best ex- amples of the first class of cases in which a change of function is the most prominent point, are seen in everyday practice in cases of so-called chronic or sub-acute synovitis, where excess of secretion in a joint is the main symptom, and in which this secretion may be re- absorbed and leave no trace of disease behind; whilst the best illustra- tions of the second class, in which change of structure is the main point of clinical as well as of pathological importance, are seen in the pulpy disease of the synovial membrane. Between the two great classes of cases, however, there are doubtless many links, for example, in acute synovitis we have change of structure even to more or less complete disorganization, and in chronic synovitis frequently repeated, we have change of structure such as gradually passes into the pulpy synovial disease. It would thus appear that in acute inflammation of the synovial membrane we have pathologically a series of changes that differ somewhat from those seen in chronic inflammation, and that while the acute form, it is true, passes into the chronic by im- perceptible gradations, the two classes of cases are, nevertheless, very distinct. Acute inflammation of a synovial membrane in its early stage is pathologically represented by what my notes of cases clearly illustrate—a more or less minute injection of the capillary vessels, passing on to a velvety appearance of the synovial surface, a flocculent surface, or one covered with fine fringes of lymph, while in the more acute cases the synovial membrane may have disappeared by ulceration or sloughing, or have so softened down as to be destroyed on the slightest touch. In the former class of cases there will be clinically increase of secretion in the joint, severe local pain and heat with surgical fever; while in the latter, there will be acute suppuration, and the synovial membrane may show any one of the conditions already indicated; or they may have disappeared, pus and broken-up membrane p alone remaining to indicate the local severity of the action as well as the destructive nature of the affection. In intermediate or less acute cases, other changes may be seen, but they are not less marked. In one, the notes of which are before me, there was visible to the eye a local patch of capillary injection, and beneath it could be made out a superficial granular change of structure in the cartilage. In another, an effusion of a firm fibrinous layer of lymph over the surface of the synovial membrane and articular cartilage showed itself, and this membrane could be raised from its bed and peeled off, not only off the synovial capsule, but also off the articular cartilage, and beneath this membrane fine radiating capillary vessels passing from the margin of the articular cartilage towards the centre were clearly visible. In this case, moreover, after a section was made through the spot of injected membrane and cartilage down to the bone, the swollen layer of membrane passing over the cartilage was clearly visible, as well as the granular degeneration of the cartilage beneath ; and this membrane could be separated from its cartilaginous con- nection by means of needles. It occurred in a child, but it seems to me to be sufficient to prove by means of pathology what ana- tomy has hitherto failed to settle, viz., that a layer of membrane Change of function. Change of structure. Changes in acute inflam mation of synovial membrane. Synovial membrane over cartilage involved.442 PATHOLOGY OP JOINT DISEASES. In subacute and chronic inflamma- tion. the synovial membrane, passes over the articular cartilage. I have seen these changes more than once. The changes that take place in the synovial membrane in sub-acute and chronic synovitis remain to he noticed, and they are essentially of the same pathological character as those we have been just considering, though they differ in this great point, that the synovial membrane is Thickening of not destroyed but becomes thickened in various degrees bv the infil- tration within its walls and upon its surface of inflammatory product, and this thickening may be so great that the synovial membrane may be represented by a tissue an inch in diameter. It will, however, be found only in cases in which repeated attacks of inflammation have taken place, and many layers of lymph have been deposited upon and in the affected tissue. The layers may not be deposited rapidly one after another by consecutive attacks of chronic inflammatory action, for they may he the result of disease which has spread over many years, hut they will always represent an inflammatory action of a chronic nature which at uncertain intervals has attacked the joint, and on each occasion left behind it pathological evidence of its pre- sence by an inflammatory infiltration. In delicate and so-called stru- mous subjects, the product will be soft and pulpy, and in the syphilitic, firmer and fibrous. It is with such changes as these that all cases of the gelatiniform or gelatinous disease of the synovial membrane, as well as the pulpy disease of Sir B. Brodie, are unquestionably to he classed. Both are of the Pulpy disease same nature pathologically and clinically, at least, all my own investi- and " gations have led to this conclusion. I shall therefore employ the phrase “ pulpy disease of the synovial membrane ” to designate the changes which ensue in chronic inflammatory synovial disease. The term is short and as expressive as any other, besides being one with which the profession is familiar. In syphilitic subjects. gelatinous condition. Changes in the articular cartilage under disease. Errors in the pathology. On the pathological changes the articular cartilages undergo from disease. The most important point the practical surgeon should recognise when considering the pathology of the articular cartilages has refer- ence to the fact, that there is no primary disease of its structure, since pathological anatomy teaches us, that all the changes found in it are secondary to som6 other affection, and in the generality of cases, to dis- ease in the articular extremities of the bones. There is no such disease, therefore, as primary “ ulceration of the cartilages,” and, when the car- tilages are diseased, they are so from the extension of mischief from the bone beneath, or from the synovial membrane around or upon them. Much has been written about the cartilages under the idea that they were liable to special diseases ; and much error has consequently crept into joint pathology. The authority of great names, such as Brodie, Key,'and others, having helped to encourage this idea. Modern investi- gation, as carried out by Redfern, Goodsir, and others, has, however, corrected this erroneous notion, and an improved pathology lias clearly shown, that the diseases of the cartilages are secondary to diseases of other tissues. Some years ago, when describing the results of my own inves- tigations, I divided these affections into the fatty, the fibrous, and the granular degenerations, and nothing that has been oh-PATHOLOGY OF JOINT DISEASES. 443 served since has led me to doubt its accuracy; indeed, additional expe- rience has confirmed its truth. I am not about to enter, however, into a minute description of the different changes, for they can be read elsewhere; but it may suffice for my present purpose to remind the reader that the fatty degeneration of the articular cartilages is found Patty in joints that have been deprived of their natural functions from any ^“£rua£°n cause—from non-use in the majority of cases, but in many from bad cartilage, nutrition—that it is found in common with the same change in the bones or other tissues. This fatty degeneration can be recognised with tolerable facility by the naked eye, for the cartilage so affected, instead of possessing its natural white pearly aspect, will appear some- what transparent, with an undulating, unequal, although smooth, sur- face. It will, when cut, feci softer than usual, and may be three or four times its natural thickness. At times it may even be “ pulped” by firm pressure with the finger, and be separated from the bone with more than usual facility. Microscopically also it 'will present character characteristic features. The natural cartilage-corpuscles will have under become changed into fat- and granule-cells in various degrees, and the microscope, hyaline matrix will be filled with cavities varying from the healthy standard to large spaces. These spaces moreover will be filled with the elements of fatty degeneration, into which the healthy corpuscles will have changed. This fatty degeneration takes place in most joints that have not been used, but rarely from disease of the joint itself. When however, a joint so changed becomes the subject of inflammation, dis- organization of the articulation rapidly follows, for such a degenerated tissue has no power of resisting disease, and disappears when attacked by it rapidly. The fibrous degeneration of the articular cartilage is a disease of a Fibrous peculiar character. I believe it to be associated with only one disease degeneration ^ v qt fvrripiiljit of a joint, which is “ osteo-arthritis.” It is very gradual in its progress cartilage, and not characterised by any definite symptoms. It can be recognised pathologically in its earliest stage by the loss of the natural glistening aspect of the cartilage of a joint, the smooth surface of which dis- appears and looks rough. Small fissures involving more or less of its thickness next appear, which sometimes extend down to the hone, and, as a rule, are thicker in the centre, they occasionally radiate outwards. The cartilage seems gradually to become thin, and after a time to disappear, exposing the articular surface of the bone, which Appearance probably will have undergone the calcareous degeneration. Micro- UI!der scopically, the principal change that is seen in this disease is the gra- micro8coPe- dual alteration of the hyaline structure into fibre. The cartilage-cor- puscles at the first will be found interspersed between these fibres, but, at a later date, to have changed into granules. At the last stage nothing but fibres may be found, and when this condition exists, the total and rapid disappearance of the structure will not be far distant. The granular. degeneration of the articular cartilage is the most Granular important affection of this tissue. It is the one most commonly degeneration found in joint affection, and seems to be the direct consequence 0f of ai:ticular a perverted nutrition in the bone or synovial membrane from dis- cartiUage- ease of these structures. Though of a simple nature, it shows itself in many ways, and, without microscopical investigation, must have appeared unintelligible. In its different forms It has doubtless led good observers to describe it as an ulceration of car-PATHOLOGY OP JOINT DISEASES. 444 Characters of granular degeneration. Changes in the hones under in- flammation, General remarks. tilage, for, under certain conditions, the cartilage presents a worm- eaten excavated appearance not unlike that which ulceration might produce. The disease is essentially a granular degeneration, first of the natural cartilage-cells embedded in the hyaline matrix, and secondly, of the hyaline matrix itself. Let a cartilage-cell undergo this granular degeneration, and the granules by accumulation and multiplication form a cavity in the hyaline matrix. Let this cavity burst on the surface of the cartilage into the joint, and an excavation is formed which can he seen by the naked eye, and a so-called ulcer is produced. Let this change take place towards the margin of the articular car- tilage, and we find an explanation of Mr. Key’s observations upon so-called ulceration of this tissue in'certain forms of inflammation of the synovial membrane of the joint. Let this change take place near the bones as a result of disease in their articular ends, and we find an explanation of the general condition of the cartilages in the bulk of joint diseases; for, when the hones entering into the formation of a joint are so affected as to interfere with the nutrition of the articular cartilages, the cartilage may either present the worm-eaten appearance all over or in part, or it may have been shed from its bony attachment, when it will be found to be lying upon the bone as a foreign body in the joint. In an early stage of disease, this granular degeneration may only be detected by a microscopical examination, although when it follows upon disease of the bone, the cartilage will always be found to peel off its articular facet with unusual facility. In synovitis also, the surface of the cartilage in contact with the inflamed membrane will be found similarly involved. Should the disease be local, as is at times seen in cases of injury to an, internal ligament such as the ligamentum teres, the change in the cartilage will he local only, but when general, the whole surface of the cartilage may he involved. In acute disease, acute degeneration follows, as is evi- denced by daily practice. On the Pathological Changes in the Bones the result of Inflammation. Inflammation of the articular extremities of a bone is a very common disease, and is probably the most common we have to deal with in con- nection with joints, for it would appear to be the cause of most, if not all of those cases of disease of the articulations which we find in children, and have been described as strumous or scrofulous disease of a joint. Some years ago, when writing on this subject, I stated that “ I cannot for one moment doubt that the majority of the cases which are described by surgeons as strumous or scrofulous disease of a joint of the articular extremities of the bones depend upon a chronic inflam- mation in the bone,” and all the experience I have gained since has tended to confirm me in this opinion. I believed then, as I believe now that the disease in its origin and progress is inflammatory, and that it is as curable as any other local affection. It is important to bear tins invariably in mind when examining or treating a case of dis- ease of a joint, particularly when it is found in a so-called strumous or cachectic subject; for if we regard the disease as a cons 1 u '°oa one, we are apt to think it ought to be treated on geneia pnncip es, and to neglect the local means by which alone a good recovery can be secured.445 PATHOLOGY OF JOINT DISEASES. Let us now inquire into the changes that the bone undergoes during this inflammatory or wrongly called strumous affection. The most striking is probably the earliest, which is the expansion Expansion of of the articular extremity, and in some cases this will be very great, the articular and generally uniform. The articular extremity of the affected hone, extremity, or the epiphyses of all the bones entering into the formation of the joint, will appear to he rounded and generally enlarged. Upon making Characters, a section of a hone thus affected, it will be found softer than natural, indeed, it may be so soft as to allow a knife to divide it, or even to break or crush it on firm pressure. To the eye, the section will appear more vas- cular than natural, the cancellated portions more cancellated, the cells enlarged, and the bony septa radiating from the shaft in a broad, palm- like fashion. The cells will also be found filled with a pinkish serum. If the disease continue, and the inflammation be of a healthy type, Bone may parts of the bone will appear denser and more indurated than the remain- become dense der; its cancelli will be filled with inflammatory products which have or- indurated ganised, and the bone will appear on section as a dense and apparently bloodless mass surrounded by other vascular cancellated tissue. Should jjay the inflammation be of an unhealthy character, diffused suppuration suppurate within the bone will take place, and death of the bone, wholly or in an“ die- part, follow. Under these circumstances, the disease will probably have become a genuine joint affection, and have extended to the synovial Extension membrane of the joint, and set up disease within its substance, into joint This extension of disease will show itself by effusion within the joint, causing joint by pulpy thickening of the synovial membrane and of the cellular lii8eMe- tissue around the articulation. Up to this point the disease has been local, involving only the articular extremities of the bones, and has not attacked the proper joint structures, and appears also to be per- fectly curable. But at this stage of the disease the articular cartilages will have become affected; for when the inflammatory action has continued for any period, and not shown any indications of subsidence, but, on the contrary has either assumed an unhealthy character, or inter- fered with the nutrition of the articular lamella of bone upon which the cartilages rest, the articular cartilage to a certainty will undergo a granular degeneration upon the surface in apposition with the bone, become loosened from its attachment, and be thrown off or shed (Fig. 532); or it may degenerate in patches and present to the eye an irregular excavated surface. If the disease be chronic, the cartilage will degenerate slowly, and be as slowly loosened from its osseous base, when it may readily be lifted off the bone by any instrument. If the disease he more rapid, the cartilage will likewise he shed more rapidly, raised as a blister off tbe bone, or found lying upon it as a foreign body, when under the micro- scope, it will appear to have undergone the granular degeneration. A\ hen the disease is acute, the cartilage may disappear altogether. Fig. 682. Articular cartilage involved. Drawing (G.

J The articulating surface of the bone during this time may appear in some cases as in inflammation, only extra-vascular; in others, it may he rough, or, so-called, ulcerating; while in a third class the’ articu- lating facets will have been shed wholly or in part. In a still worse class, pieces of necrosed hone involving more or less of the articular extremity of the bone will he seen, while in the worst, an abscess will have made its way into the joint of the diseased articular ex- tremity. In all these conditions, the cartilages will have disap- peared and the joint become disorganized. These pathological remarks are applicable to every articulation, to the hip as much as to the knee, and to the shoulder as to the elbow. Clinical Symptoms associated with these Pathological Changes. The symptoms by which these pathological changes which have been described can be recognised, vary according to the formation and surroundings of each joint, but in their general character they are the same. Any inflammation of the synovial membrane of whatever kind, always shows itself within a few hours or days of its origin by effusion, and consequently by distension of the articulation, while in the knee, ankle, elbow, wrist, shoulder, and other joints, this clinical condition makes itself manifest in a way which cannot be misinterpreted. The synovial sac becomes enlarged and distended by the effusion, so that it bulges between the bones and gives an outline to the joint unlike that furnished by any other condition. In the hip-joint similar changes take place, but they are not quite so palpable though they can be made out by a careful examination, and particularly by a comparison of the affected with the sound side, a point of practice which should never be omitted in the examination of any injured or diseased joint; the soft parts in front of the joint will be more prominent and full; pain will be produced by gentle pressure made upon the part, particularly behind the great trochanter, where a soft swelling, which will be mani- fest to the eye, will also exist in lieu of the natural depression. Even fluctuation may be detected through the joint on careful palpation. At any rate, to the eye and hand there will be clearly some extra fulness of the soft parts, sufficient to lead a surgeon to suspect the true nature of the disease. In disease of the articular extremities of the bones, a different clinical condition will be present. At the commencement of the disease, and sometimes for a lengthened period which varies in each case, an aching of the part is the only local symptom. This aching may be of greater or less intensity, and depends much on the severity of the disease. It is too often regarded as “ growing pains ” or rheu- matism. What I wish now to note is, that local pain is the first clinical symptom and not effusion, and that there is no enlargement of the affected joint. As the disease progresses, however, an enlargement may be detected, which in the hip can be made out by manipulation; whereas in the knee or other joints, it may be visible to the eye. It will, however, be an enlargement clearly of the bone, a thickening or expan- sion of the osseous structure unlike that existing in synovial disease.447 DISEASES OP SPECIAL JOINTS. there will be no fluctuation, no soft yielding of the parts, but clearly an expansion of the osseous structure, an enlargement of the articular extremity of the bone, while the soft parts over the enlarged bone are quite natural. With this aching of the part, there may also be in- crease of heat as an early symptom, yet this symptom is not con- stant, although almost uniformly so; it will, moreover, be intermit- tent, and, as a rule, show itself as a general periodical flushing of the part. In chronic synovitis which leads to joint changes, the joint may pro- Manipulative bably be gently moved without exciting pain or spasm of the muscles indication iu that move the articulation. Pressure upon the part with the fingers will probably excite it, although moderate pressure of one bone against the other may be made without giving rise to any indications of dis- tress. , In diseases of the hone entering into the formation of the joint, jn diseases of these clinical conditions do not all exist. The joint may be moved bone ends, quietly, without exciting pain, but the attempt will, as a rule, ex- cite spasm of one or more of the groups of muscles which move the articulation. Moderate manipulation also will be well borne. Firm pressure upon the bone so as to bring the two articular surfaces inter- in contact will always excite pain, not the pressure produced by a jar, articular such as in the hip is caused by a sudden blow upon the foot or tro- Pres5nre- chanter, for such a mode of investigation must be looked upon as rough and somewhat uncertain; indeed, it is almost sure to excite a start in the patient and an expression of pain, but the pressure which is produced by a steady force applied by the hand to the trochanter towards the pelvis, or through the foot to the articular extremities of the bones; a pressure which, in synovial disease, rarely, if ever, gives rise to pain, but in osteal disease invariably excites it. These symptoms in the two classes of cases appear clearly to indicate the two distinct affections in their early stage. They apply to all articulations, and may be thus summarised:— In synovial disease, swelling is the earliest clinical symptom, with Summary, more or less fluctuation, each joint showing this in its own way. As a rule, this swelling is unattended with much pain. Pressure on the joint causes pain, although gentle movement may he made without increasing it or exciting spasm of the muscles which surround the joint. Inter-articular pressure can generally be tolerated. In articular ostitis, pain is the earliest and most constant symptom— Symptoms in pain of an aching character varying in intensity and generally increased articular by firm local pressure. There will be no visible enlargement of the 03tit'8- part for some weeks or months, and no fluctuation. Gentle move- ment, generally, excites spasm of muscles about the joint, and inter- articular pressure always increases this and causes pain. Increased heat also exists about the parts and is of an intermittent character. DISEASES OF SPECIAL JOINTS. Diseases of the Hip-joint. Authors have hitherto led their readers to look upon diseases of the On diseases hip-joint as a special or peculiar affection, and to regard it patho-of the hiP- logically and clinically as distinct from diseases of the other joints joint’448 DISEASES OF SPECIAL JOINTS. General remarks. Not strictly a constitu- tional disease. Is a local affection. A frequent disease. Statistics. Ages. Such, however, is not the case, for diseases of the hip-joint differ in no single pathological point from those of any other articulation. It has also with too much confidence been described as a “ strumous disease,” as if all diseases of the hip-joint or of any joint were generally of this nature, or found in subjects only of a strumous diathesis; as if all had a constitutional and not a local origin. Hip-joint disease is a local disease, and is mostly set up by local causes. It is, moreover, as amenable to local treatment as any other affection. “ It occurs very frequently in strumous children,” says Mr. Holmes, “ a circumstance which has led to its being denominated ‘ strumous,’ but it seems to have no necessary connection with struma, unless so wide a signification be assigned to that somewhat vague term as would render the designation itself unmeaning. If by struma be meant a state of the system which renders the subject of it prone to the deposit of tubercle in the viscera, I think that there is good reason for asserting that morbus coxarius often attacks children who are not strumous—i. e. who do not display any such tendency to the deposit of tubercle—and therefore that no decisive proof of any strumous ten- dency is afforded by the presence of the affection. If, on the contrary, struma be, defined as that condition of the system which disposes its sub- jects to the development of low inflammations of various kinds, then it is difficult to see what is the significance of the designation.” It would, therefore, be well to discard the erroneous notion that hip disease has its origin in a constitutional cause, for till that is effected the local treatment is likely to be disregarded or looked upon as of secondary importance, when all who have much experience in the treat- ment of these cases will admit that local treatment cannot be made too prominent a feature. It should therefore be looked upon clinically as a local affection and to be treated by local means, such constitutional treatment being employed as the general condition of the patient may appear to warrant, the same principles of practice being applicable in these cases as have been found of value in other joint affections. Hip disease, unfortunately, is a very common affection, and my own statistics inform me that it forms about 30 per cent, of the joint cases admitted into a metropolitan hospital. It is also an affection of child life, for out of 360 cases of which I have notes, 62 per cent., or nearly two thirds, occurred in children under ten years of age, and four fifths in patients under twenty, that is, it occurred during the period .of the growth and development of the bone, and not during that of its full maturity. This point will be seen on reference to the following table:— Table showing the ages at which hip disease commenced.

Pathology of hip disease.—It has been already stated that in a Pathology of pathological point of view, hip disease differs in no respect from that hlP disease, of other joints, and is not a strumous affection although it may occur in strumous subjects. It may also be repeated, that it is a very rare thing to find strumous or tubercular matter in a diseased hip- joint. Excluding new growths, disease of the hip consequently means, inflammation of the bones or soft parts entering into the articu- lation. In the pathology of joints, few points probably have been more On the seat disputed than the seat of the disease in hip-joiut affection; and I believe the difficulty has been entirely raised on the mistaken lscase‘ notion, that the nature of the affection was different from that of other joint diseases. We have never heard much importance placed upon the point in diseases of the knee, shoulder, or other joints. The question as to the origin or not of disease of the knee in the crucial ligaments, or of disease of the shoulder in the long tendon of the biceps has never been very warmly discussed. And yet we find men gravely discussing the question as to the origin of hip disease in the ligamentum teres. My late much respected teacher, Mr. Aston Key, laid great stress on this point, and believed that it was from that ligament and its attachments that disease of the hip-joint gene- rally proceeded. Pathology has, however, made great advances since those days, and we now know that disease in a joint (hip or other) may have its origin in the bones which form the joint, or, in the soft parts or ligaments that hold them together. Experience, moreover, has taught us that we may have an acute inflammation of the synovial membrane rapidly going on to complete disorganization of the ligaments, carti- lages, and soft parts of the joint, and even causing death of the bones entering into its formation. The inflammation may be so acute as to O/ten render it difficult at the post-mortem examination to read the patho- logical facts correctly, for when such changes as these take place, it is fairly open to question whether the inflammation originated in the synovial membrane and spread to the bones, cartilages, and ligaments causing their destruction; or, whether it began in an osseous centre and extended to the joint. This difficulty is experienced when the disease has been so severe as to cause a division of the pelvic bones into their original segments, or a separation of the epiphysis of bone forming the head of the femur from its normal attachment to the neck. When the bones of the joint are equally involved in acute disease. Indication as it is probable that the mischief began in the synovial membrane and to the spread to the bone. But, when we find one bone more diseased than origin/ another, e. g. the femur than the acetabulum, or vice versd, it is pro- ° bable, that acute inflammation originated in it and spread to the soft parts. These points, however, are to be looked upon as only feeble indications and not as definite guides, upon which an opinion may be vol. ii. 29DISEASES OF SPECIAL JOINTS. 450 Sequestrum ot bone as an indication. Origin of the disease to be determined by vertical section of bone. Generally an inflammatory action in bone and extending to joint, &c. formed. In chronic disease of the hip-joint, the question as to the seat of the original disease is not so easily answered, and yet, from what I have observed clinically and pathologically, the question is not one impossible to answer. When a joint is disorganized its ligaments and cartilages gone, and the articular surfaces of the bone exposed, or perhaps diseased, there may be some difficulty in de- ciding as to the particular tissue in which the inflammation originated; but, when a section of the bone is made—e. g. the head of a femur, or the head of a tibia—and a cavity, a sequestrum, or a suppurating bone is found communicating with the joint, probabilities certainly point to the bone as being the original seat of the disease. But it may be asserted that in such instances no one doubts the cause of the joint disease, since the pathological conditions clearly prove it; yet the clinical histories of such cases differ in no single point from those of others in which, perhaps, the same very marked evidence of disease is not to be seen, that is, if the joint be examined on its surface only. Indeed, to examine a pathological specimen of a bone or of a diseased joint, it is absolutely necessary to make a vertical section through the bone; since to look at it from the joint surface is most fallacious, and an opinion formed from the appearance thus acquired is too likely to be erroneous. . If we make, then, a section of the bone in chronic disease of the joint, we shall find in a large number of cases, specially in the young, hyper temia of its articular extremity and condensation, if not suppuration or necrosis from chronic inflammatory action (Fig. 533); in fact, we shall find marked evidence of articular ostitis in one of its stages, for, doubtless, during young life this is the most common form of disease which precedes joint mischief, and from which joint disease proceeds. This opinion is also corroborated by the fact that, in our museums, almost every specimen of chronic joint disease reveals extensive bone mis- chief extending beyond the surface, and generally involving more or less of the articular ends of the bone which enter into the formation of the joint. In our Guy’s museum, this point is very strongly dis- played, and on looking over other museums and extensive notes of joint cases, the same truth is apparent. At times, however, the disease may primarily commence in the epiphysial car- tilage situated between the head of the femur and its neck, the epiphysis as a con- sequence being thrown off (Fig. 534). This pathological observation must be looked upon as of great clinical importance, for if the majority of cases of joint disease is to be attributed to the extension of an in- flammatory action from the articular ex- tremity of a bone to the other tissues, it becomes a question of urgency to recognise the disease of the bone in its early stage, in order to prevent its progress to the tissues upon which the integrity1 of Fig. 533. Necrosis of the head of the femur, with sequestrum in its Prep. 1S185, Guy’s Mus.ON HIP DISEASE. 451 the joint itself depends; and clinically, there is good reason to believe that such can frequently be done. In the hip-joint it may be difficult, possibly more difficult than it is in disease of other articulations that are not so well covered in with soft parts, such as the knee; but it can be made out with care and discrimination even in the hip. And here it may be well to consider the clini- cal features upon which our diagnosis should be determined. Diagnosis. The necessity of making'a correct and early diagnosis of hip disease scarcely requires il- lustration, and did not daily ex- perience indicate that it is not sufficiently recognised, there would be no occasion to dwell upon it. The early symptoms of the affection, consequently, are important. When a child after injury to the hip has joint pain and possibly Symptoms of limps, and these symptoms persist after all external evidence of injury *"P disease, has passed away, there is some reason to suspect the presence of joint mischief; and when this pain is increased by inter-articular pressure, by means either of the hand applied over the trochanter or by the patient standing or walking, the suspicion should be strengthened. When swelling of the parts can be made out, and some bulging of the synovial membrane, as shown by a fulness behind the trochanter and m the groin, is found to exist combined with tenderness, synorial inflammation is rendered probable; and when persistent pain without effusion is the more prominent symptom, aggravated by firm inter- articular pressure, bone mischief is indicated. When these symp- toms appear after some fever or illness, or, indeed, without any such cause, they are of no less importance, although, probably, they are more liable to be overlooked. As a clinical point of primary importance, all joint pain, and parti- Pain as a cularly hip-joint claims attention, and when this is referred to the symptom, knee, the surgeon must not be misled. Limping of any kind always Limphw indicates something wrong—probably very wrong—more particularly when combined with joint pain, aggravated by inter-articular pres- sure. Spasm of the muscles around the joint is a symptom of great significance and a means that nature adopts to ensure immobility o*f the nlusdes^ affected articulation ; in some cases, it will be so severe as to forbid all movement, but in others less marked; at one time it will be con- fined to one group of muscles such as the flexors, when the position of the limb will be determined, while at others, the rotators or adductors will be affected; but whenever it is met with, there is pro- bably some affection of the joint itself, or of the bones that enter into its formation. When doubt exists as to muscular spasm bein°- the cause of joint immobility, chloroform should be used, as all spasm Fig. 531. Separation of epiphysis forming the head of femur. Guy’s Mus.

Position of Limb as a means of Diagnosis. In the diagnosis or treatment of hip disease there is no point which deserves closer attention than the position of the limb, and I ain disposed to think it has not received that attention, since ex- perience has proved, that most of the cases of deformity met with after a natural cure of the disease, are due to a want of appreciation of its importance. In one case the limb will appear elongated, but on measurement, no real lengthening will be detected, the apparent elongation being due to the tilting upwards of the pelvis on the sound side, from the patient either naturally throwing all the weight of the body on that side to take off pressure from the affected one, or, from muscular spasm causing abduction of the limbs (Fig. 535). In another case the pelvis on the affected side will be drawn up, and tilted slightly backwards, the thigh becoming adducted and more or less flexed upon the pelvis (Fig. 536), or in some cases rotated outwards from the spasmodic contraction of the muscles that move the hip. In other and more Fig. 535. Fig. 535a. Apparent elongation of the left lower ex- tremity in hip disease on the leftside due to adduction of the limb and the necessary tilting upwards of the pelvis on the sound side to allow the abducted limb being brought into a line with the body. Fig. 535a shows the deducted position of the diseased lelt, limb when the pelvis has been brought into its natural posi- tion at right angles to the spine. advanced cases, genuine shortening of the limb may take place from either real loss of substance in the head or neck of the bone, or, in exceptional cases, from dislocation of the head of the femur upwards and backwards (ilio-iscliiatic) ; and, in rarer examples, the neck and shaft of the femur may be separated and displaced upwards and backwards, the epiphysial head of the bone being left in the acetabulum. Hus probably occurred in the case from which Figs. 537-8 were taken. Where the joint is flexed, some spinal deformity (lordosis) will exist453 ON HIP DISEASE. when the patient stands or lies, but this apparent spinal curve will, however, even in the worst cases, at once disappear when the patient is placed on his back and the limb raised (Fig. 539, 540), or when he Fig. 536.

All cases, however, of suppuration about the joint, even when associated with disease of the joint, are not to be regarded as a direct result of disorgani- sation of the articulation; since it is quite certain that inflammatory mis- chief may exist in the joint and sub- side, and yet be followed by suppura- tion in the cellular tissue about the part; and in this opinion, pathological does but confirm clinical observation. There may be some difficulty in mak- ing out such cases during life, but I have no doubt as to their existence. In the hip they are the more common.

Arrest of growth in the bone may result. On the diagnosis of hip disease. anchylosis; and in the minority with hony. In the * Medical Times and Gazette ’ for 1869, I illustrated all these points fully by a series of cases. A very beautiful example of bony anchylosis is represented in Fig. 544. It sometimes happens when articular ostitis has attacked the head and neck of the femur in childhood, and recovery has taken place with either a movable or anchylosed joint, that some arrest of growth in the bone may be the result. I have seen this in a child, aet. 8, who had been under my care when five years of age for articular ostitis, from which she perfectly recovered; the femur on the affected side being an inch shorter than its fellow, the tro- chanter nearer the median line of the body and the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium; the seat of the shortening being clearly in the neck of the femur, which had been arrested in its growth. (Fig. 545.) The diagnosis of hip disease is to be made after a careful estimation of the value of the symptoms as a whole, and not upon one or more supposed typical symptoms. The limping of a child with infantile paralysis of the leg has been confused with that from disease of the hip; but the wasting of the limb and the absence of pain ought to prevent such an error. The pain of spinal disease, of psoas abscess, of suh-iliac abscess, of some glandular affection of the groin associated with limping, and nerve pain extending down the limb may mislead; hut the knowledge of these facts may prevent the repetition of such mistakes. A congenital displacement of the head of the femur has been frequently mistaken for the affection (vide p. 370). Disease of the bursa connected with the psoas muscle in front of the joint, which at times communicates with it, may ren- der the diagnosis difficult, but the pain on pressure in front of the joint which exists in disease of the bursa, and the pain on pressure behind the trochanter in hip disease, is enough to distinguish the two. Disease of the bursa beneath the gluteus maximus muscle may also at times simulate hip affection, hut with care the two affections can be distinguished. Fig. 545. Less liable to repair. Diseases of the Knee-joint. This joint is probably more frequently the seat of disease than any other, and in hospital practice, my own statistics tell me that it forms 40 per cent, of the joint cases admitted into Guy’s. The greater liability of the knee to injury, the thinness of its natural covering, and the complicated formation of the joint, together probably afford the true explanation of this fact. It is met with, moreover, in patients of a more mature age than hip disease, 62 per cent, of hip cases and only 32 of knee disease being found in children under ten. It must he admitted, however, that the knee when once diseased is less likely to457 DISEASES OF KNEE-JOINT. undergo a natural cure and much less a cure by anchylosis, than any other articulation. This is probably to be explained anatomically by the existence of the inter-articular fibro-cartilages, which, while in a healthy joint they tend to keep it healthy, in a diseased, by forbid- Presence of ding the contact of the two bones, render it difficult for anchy- inter- losis to take place, since they must be partially at least got rid cartilages, of by some suppuration or other change before anchylosis can be secured.

The extensor muscles above the patella likewise will be raised by the distended sac, and the soft parts below the patella down to its ligament will project; distinct fluctua- hs. 616. tion not only being felt across the joint from side to side, but in an oblique direction from above downwards. Acute synovitis of the knee, except as a part of so-called rheumatic fever or pyaemia, is rarely met .with, unless as the result of a wound or the extension of suppurating disease into the cavity. It is a most severe affection, and unless speedily arrested by ice, leeching, or those means suggested in the chapter on wounds of joints, ends in the de- struction of the joint, and too often in the forfeiture of the patient’s life. When, after suppuration, life is spared Repair after and the joint goes on to repair, anchylosis suppuration, may he secured, and in puerperal, rheumatic, or pytemic cases, this result is not rarely met with, the joint undergoing the whole series of changes in a few months. This subject, however, will receive attention in the chapter on the suppuration of joints. In sub-acute synovitis, a far more common form than the acute. Subacute the local symptoms are the same, but the constitutional are far less 3-vnovitls' severe, whether the disease be caused by some local injury or by some general cause, such as gout, gonorrhoea, rheumatism, or syphilis ; it moreover almost always terminates in recovery. To chronic synovitis the same remarks are applicable. This affection Chronic is often known as hydrops articuli or simple dropsy of the joint, the synovitis, chief symptom being an excess of fluid. In many of these cases, how- ever, this effusion into the joint is associated with other changes such as are known to exist in what is now recognised as a special affection Osteo —the chronic rheumatic or osteo-arthritis. In it the joint becomes arthritis, so stretched by the effusion, and the ligaments at last become so useless Acute synovitis. May suppurate.

In a large number, however, plates of bones will be found in the synovial membrane or about the articular ends of the bones, as well as bony out- growths or fringes of ossific matter from the margins of the articular facets, together with other changes, to which attention will be directed in the proper place. It is well, however, to remember here, that a large number of the cases of chronic synovitis or hydrops articuli, are really examples of the peculiar disease known as rheumatic or osteo- arthritis. In the abticulab ostitis of the knee-joint the expanded hones are soon made out on comparing the sound with the affected limb, for the articulation thus affected acquires a special shape which is not to be misinterpreted, the condyles of the femur and head of the tibia assum- ing a globular form, the soft parts covering in the bones being healthy and moveable, and no effusion existing in the joint. (Fig. 547.) At times, a joint so affected, will become two inches larger than its fellow; when effusion is present, the extension of the inflammatory action from the bone to the joint itself is indicated, the case being clearly a more severe one. The condyles of the femur or head of the tibia alone may also be the seat of suppurative disease, of an acute or chronic abscess, these local bone abscesses being probably more common in the head of the tibia than elsewhere. Under these circum- stances, the enlargement will be confined to the hone affected, until the abscess burrows into the cavity of the joint when the joint becomes inflamed. This sup- puration may occur with or without necro- sis. Fig. 559 illustrates a case in which diseased joint followed necrosis. In the pulpy disease of the synovial membrane, the local symptoms by which the affection is to be diagnosed are likewise characteristic. In typical cases neither ex- panded bones nor dilatation of the synovial sac with fluid is present, but the different points of bone which are always to he made out in a healthy joint, are obscured, if not undistinguish- able; they are covered in with a soft solid, yielding on palpation over the articular ends of the bones, and more particularly around the patella, a doughy sensation. No fluctuation is to be detected, as a rule, and, when fluid exists, it will clearly be in a thickened capsule. At times, this pulpy thickening of the synovial mem- brane is a secondary affection, due either to some articular ostitis or to repeated attacks of synovitis. It may also occur as part of a syphilitic disease from the effusion of gummy material around the joint. What Collis described as syphilitic joint, I believe to be of this nature, viz. the pulpy disease, in a syphilitic subject, possibly complicated with periosteal thickening. Diseases of the Ankle-joint Nothing particular is to be noticed in the diseases of this joint; their Fig. 547. Appearance of knee tlie seat of articular ostitis.459 DISEASES OF ANKLE-JOINT. pathology is identical with that of all other joints, synovial mischief being possibly more common than affections of the bone. Effusion into the joint is readily detected by the swelling and consequent pressing forwards of the extensor muscles of the foot, by the fluctuation between the malleoli in front, and at times behind, and along the bor- ders of the tendo Achillis. Bone enlargement is readily seen by the expanded malleolus or malleoli. Bone abscess may occur in either malleolus or in the astragalus. The pulpy disease makes itself known by some such swelling as is found in synovitis, but the swelling will not be due to fluid, but to the presence of the lowly organised tissue found in the disease, showing itself in a doughy swelling around one or both of the malleoli and beneath the extensor tendons. Disease of the Tarsal and Metatarsal Joints, or, rather, of the bones and joints, are very common ; for it is in the On diseases bones, as a rule, that the disease begins, the joints becoming involved tarsul secondarily. Disease in the joint between the astragalus and os calcis metatarsal may, however, be found alone, and I believe that such disease is com- joints, monlv the result of some lateral sprain of the ligaments that hold Sub-astraga- these bones together; lateral sprains of the foot being more likely to be felt at this articulation than at the ankle, as the astragalus is held so firmly between the malleoli. Disease in this joint is to be recognised by the swelling being beneath the malleoli; the pain produced by any lateral movement of the heel or foot; and occasionally by the grat- ing of exposed bone. The movements of the ankle joint will be un- involved. Disease of the other tarsal or metatarsal bones is indicated by the en- Indications, largement of the bones, as well as by the position of the sinuses leading down to them. The scaphoid bone and joints are frequently affected, this bone being the keystone of the antero-posterior arch of the foot; and when so affected, the disease very commonly extends to the cunei- form bones, there being but one synovial capsule common to the scaphoid and the three cuneiform bones. The form of the foot thus affected is very peculiar. “ It assumes,” Appearances writes Erichsen, “ a remarkable bulbous or clubbed appearance; the of the foot, fore part and dorsum of the foot are greatly swollen, glazed, and possibly perforated by sinuses discharging thin unhealthy pus.” (‘ Science and Art of Surgery.’) When diseased and dead, these four bones may be re- moved, and a good foot left. As a single bone, the cuboid is also not rarely diseased, and may be taken away without any detriment. In the case figured (Fig. 548) the scaphoid, three cuneiform, and cuboid bones were removed, and an excellent foot remained. I removed them from a boy, set. 8, by simply enucleating the diseased and dead bones from their beds, and disturbing the periosteum and soft parts as little as possible. Fig. 548. Case.

Diseases ? of the ! symphysis pubis. Diseases of the coccygeal joint. Of the metatarso-phalangeal joints that of the great toe is the one most frequently diseased, either from injury or otherwise, and when so affected, it is troublesome to deal with. There is some reason to believe that the bursae about the sesamoid bones at the ball of the toe are occasionally the source of the evil. When dead hone exists in these joints it may be removed, and in some cases the joint may be excised with a good result. I have done this on many occasions, and in several a moveable joint was secured. Gouty affections of this joint are very common and may go on to dis- organization. Disease of the joint as a result of a neglected bunion is not rare, but such cases will be treated of in another page. Disease of the Pelvic Joints is often overlooked or mistaken for hip or spinal disease, yet it has features of its own. It is more commonly met with in adults than in children, and after parturition than local injury, and is usually chronic. It may be secondary to disease of the bones that form the joint. In its early stage it is characterised by pelvic or gluteal pains which are aggravated by exercise, relieved by rest, and often put down as rheumatic. Lameness is generally present with a very peculiar, un- steady, rolling gait. Local tenderness will generally be manifested on digital pressure over the joint, and pain excited by separating or pressing upon the iliac wings, swelling along the line of joint may also be visible. The thigh may or may not be flexed, but it will be made to move freely when the pelvis is fixed. As the disease progresses, sup- puration will appear either in the gluteal region over the sacro- iliac joint or in the pelvis, and when the thigh is permanently flexed, pelvic suppuration is indicated. It is to be distinguished from hip dis- ease by the fact that there is free movement of the femur in the aceta- bulum when the patient is recumbent and no spasm of pelvic muscles. There is, moreover, no swelling behind the trochanter or pain on pressure in the part. In no stage of the disease will there be any shortening of the limb. In the treatment of this affection, the same principles are applicable as in other joints—rest, tonics, good food, and air being essentials. As soon as suppuration can be made out, an incision should be made to prevent burrowing; and when dead bone is present, it should be removed. I have taken away large pieces of bone from this joint with great benefit. Disease of the symphysis pubis is very rare, and I have seen it but twice. One of the cases was in a man, who some months before coming under my care was believed to have fractured his pelvis and lacerated his urethra. When I saw him, sinuses existed running down to and into the joint, but no dead bone could be felt. In Guy’s Museum there is a preparation, 131450, in which the synchondrosis is ossified and carious; and a second, 131440, in which complete anchy- losis is present with new bone. Disease of the coccygeal joint is at least as rare as that of the pubic, although well-marked cases have been recorded. It can readily be made out by thickening over the joint, and pain produced by any movement in the bone; in some cases a distinct grating can be felt with the finger in the rectum on attempting to move the part. When the disease is clearly established and the joint disorganizedDISEASES OF ELBOW-JOINT. 461 the best practice is probably the removal of the bone; and, when this is not advisable or practicable, the coccygeal muscles had better be divided by a subcutaneous incision to give rest to the joint, but under these circumstances, the cure must be slow. The pains of sacro- coccygeal joint disease are much simulated by what Sir J. Simpson described (‘ Med. Times,’ 1859) as coccydynia, which is met with in women when any of the coccygeal muscles are brought into action by walking, running, rising, defecating, or sneezing. This affection may he cured by the subcutaneous section of the coccygeal muscles. Diseases of the Joints of the Upper Extremity.

In syphilitic subjects, however, inflammation about the joint is not unfrequent, but such cases rarely suppurate. The disease when it occurs is easily recognised, the joint being superficial. Disease between the sternal segments has been recorded by Hilton. I have seen but two examples of it, and both were complicated with sub-sternal abscess and necrosis. Local pain increased on pressure, and the movement produced on coughing, with swelling, indicate the disease. Diseases of the Shoulder-Joint are comparatively rare, and form a very small proportion of the Diseases of joint cases admitted into a hospital, the majority of such cases Ml® shoulder- being treated outside.

If recovery take place with anchylosis, a wonderfully useful Anchylosis, limb is often secured, the scapula allowing an amount of movement which is sufficient for most of the duties of life, though it rarely admits of any overhanded action. When disease takes place at the junction of the upper epiphysis and shaft, and suppuration follows, the abscess burrows in the same way, and much difficulty may be expe- rienced in the diagnosis of the case, although the thickening about the neck of bone under these circumstances is generally greater than in joint trouble. When inflammation of the bursa placed beneath the deltoid muscles exists, some of the symptoms of sboulder-joint disease are present, but the fact that the least action of the deltoid muscle excites pain in bursal disease when the movement of the arm by the surgeon does not, and that the joint moves freely although possibly attended with a sense of crepitation, ought to suggest its nature, Diseases of the Elbow-joint are of great importance, as the value of the hand is greatly de- pendent upon the integrity of the elbow, and a stiff elbow-joint is a serious detriment. In their general pathology they are the same as any other joint.DISEASES OF ELBOW-JOINT. 402 Diseases of _ Synovitis makes itself known by the general enlargement of the joint.

Pulpy disease is recognised by the presence of the doughy, semi-fluctuating products that have been poured out in the same position. Articular ostitis can be recognised by the expanded bones. In a general way, elbow-joint cases do well, recovery taking place with movement, in the majority, while in the minority, a natural cure takes place by anchylosis, with or without external suppuration. The amount of movement that may at times be se- cured after a natural reco- very from a suppurating joint is very good. Fig. 549 was taken from a boy, set. 19, who had had a disor- ganized joint treated by free incisions when ten years of age. In it the head of the radius was displaced outwards. He had as much movement as the drawing indicates. In many cases, useful flexion and extension are often secured as well as pronation and supination, and in some while these latter movements are preserved, the ulna and humerus are firmly fixed together, and when so, the value of the hand is but little diminished. In several of my own cases, I have found after many years the rotation of the radius perfect.

When suppuration takes place, the pus often burrows freely between the tendons, but as long as necrosed bone does not exist to prevent recovery, a good result may be looked for, although probably with some amount of stiffness or even anchy- losis. When necrosed bone keeps up the irritation it should be removed. To assist recovery the hand should be secured by a splint in the position intermediate between pronation and supination, such an one being the best. When the hand is left alone it is too apt to assume the prone position—a by no means good one. Disease of the Radio-ulnar Joint Of radio- is rarely met with,.

When a natural cure by anchylosis only can be looked for, the question of the removal of the finger may be entertained as a matter of expediency, for a stiff joint at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint is a serious detriment, while at the middle joint it is less injurious, and least so at the terminal one. In the thumb, amputation is rarely to he thought of, for when re- covery from disease of the distal phalangeal joint is probable by anchylosis, a good thumb may be secured, though the same result in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint is so inconvenient that the opera- tion of excision is probably preferable. But every case must be treated on its own merits and according to its own special wants. The position of the patient, his occupation, age, &c., should have a powerful influence in guiding the surgeon to a decision. ON THE TREATMENT AND CURE OF JOINT DISEASE. In the treatment of joint disease the most important point a surgeon Curability of has to hear in mind is its curability, since clinical experience affords Joi,lt diseH8e- convincing evidence that, under judicious management, a large propor- tion of joint cases can be guided successfully to a complete recovery, and that while in some a cure can only take place by anchylosis or a stiff joint, it is in exceptional cases only that severe operative interference is required. The recollection of these facts is a constant encouragement to the surgeon to persevere with, and to the patient to submit to, the necessary means adapted to secure these ends; while it in no way tends to discourage operative interference, when the course, nature, or severity of the disease affords sufficient evidence that such inter- ference is expedient or necessary. All pathological evidence tends likewise to the support of these con- As proved elusions, for no one can have carefully examined joints that have t)y., been removed by either excision or amputation, or others that have evidence!0* failed to go on towards a successful issue, without being struck by the vast amount of repair that exists side by side with the disease, and by the apparently limited character of the latter, and without feel- ing in many cases where a capital operation had been performed that simple operative interference would probably have been successful, or that none at all was really required. At the same time it must be borne in mind that while in a patho- logical sense disease may need no interference, on account of its limited nature or reparable character, yet, in a clinical aspect, a very opposite conclusion may reasonably have to be drawn; since the dis.b‘* El ease by its progressive and weakening tendency may have demon- oiLervatUm,Early excision advised by some.

In the treatment of joint disease, however, it is not always a ques- tion as to the possibility or impossibility of securing a successful issue by simply aiding natural efforts, since questions of expediency come before the surgeon as to the wisdom of making the attempt, or as to whether better results might not be secured by surgical interference. Surgeons, moreover, who look upon a stiff elbow- or shoulder-joint as a serious inconvenience and an unsatisfactory result of treatment, con- sequently advocate early excision of a joint with the view of obtaining movement; and those who have little belief in natural processes guided by art, bringing about anchylosis in disease of the knee, or who think that the time occupied in the attempt is badly spent, advocate a like practice. While some surgeons are always satisfied with a cure of the disease by natural efforts assisted by art, and remove by operative measures joints or parts of joints when these natural processes have proved themselves incompetent to effect a cure; others maintain that in a large number of cases these natural processes lead only to an undesirable end, and that it is not expedient to trust to them. Arguments of expediency also are used, and in recent times have gained in importance, more particularly as brought to bear upon the question of a cure with a stiff joint, when a prolonged interval of time must of necessity be required to secure the end. In some cases, such arguments are of weight, and worthy of consideration, although as a broad rule of practice it is dangerous to adopt them, for, in the majority of cases, natural processes guided by art are followed by results which leave little to be desired, and are secured without the risks which are attached to all operative interference. These points, however, will come out better when the treatment of individual joints has to be considered, and to which attention will now be drawn. Treatment of Disease of the Hip-joint. So long as suppuration or other disorganizing change in the joint has not appeared, a good hope of a recovery with a useful articulation may be entertained; and so long as the disease is in the synovial mem- brane, the probabilities of a recovery with a moveable joint are great. In a large number of cases where time has been allowed to pass and disease has gone on to produce degenerative changes in the articular cartilages, recovery with anchylosis is to be looked for; anchylosis without suppuration being more common after articular ostitis than after synovial disease (vide paper, by author, in ‘ Med. Times,’ July and August, 1869). When, however, disease originates in the epiphy- sis of the head of the bone—or in the epiphysial connective cartilage between the epiphysis and shaft, the prospects of a recovery with movement are slight, unless the mischief be checked in its early stage; for, in the former case, the articular cartilage which derives its nourishment mainly from the bone, soon undergoes degenerative changes that can only be repaired by processes ending in anchylosis; and, in the latter, the epiphysis is often cast off as a foreign body, when recovery can only take place on its exfoliation or removal. In both classes of cases, however, the treatment is in a measure the same—that is, the joint is to be at rest, and all inter-articular pressureON THE TREATMENT AND CURE OF JOINT DISEASE. 465 is to be avoided, for “in diseases of the joints rest cannot be too much insisted upon” (John Hunter, 1787); and for these ends the applica- tion of a splint is essential, that form of splint being the best which keeps the joint quiet, the pelvis at its normal angle to the spinal column, and the affected limb from being either adducted or abducted; without doubt, these points are best preserved by the double splint figured in 507, 550. Children with this splint well adjusted can be moved with the greatest facility, and, even when there is acute joint disease, with very little suffering. Sir C. Bell clearly saw the sir C. Bell’s necessity of rest, and was so impressed with it as to make the fol- suggestion, lowing ingenious suggestion:—“ I have observed that patients who have hip disease recover when anchylosis of the joint takes place, when the bones become fixed and immovable. Founding upon this, I attempted by various contrivances to form an instrument which might keep the bones at perfect rest, but so great is the tendency in this joint to motion, that I have never yet succeeded. No instrument has ever been effectual in keeping the thigh and trunk fixed.” “ I have been led to think that an operation might be performed here; that a cut might he made to expose the upper part of the femur, and the neck he sawn through ; not, you will observe, to take away the head of the bone, as done by Mr. White with success, but to permit it to remain at rest and to form an adhesion with the acetabulum. In this case a joint will be formed where the bone has been divided ” (‘ Lond. Med. Gaz.,’ Jan. 12, 1828, “ Hip Diseases,” by Sir C., then Mr. Bell.) When suppuration has appeared, re- covery with anchylosis can alone he looked for, though where diseased bone exists this result cannot be expected, unless the dis- eased bone is cast off or removed. When, however, an abscess has been the result of chronic changes in a pulpy synovial mem- brane, the complete disorganization of the joint need not, as a necessary consequence, be contemplated, although where it has fol- lowed disease in the articular extremities of the bones (articular ostitis), it is more than probable that the articular carti- lages with the ligaments and synovial cap- sule will have been completely destroyed. Under the former circumstances, therefore, when the suppuration has taken place as a consequence of synovial disease, recovery may ensue with soft or fibrous anchy- losis, or even some degree of movement; whilst under the latter, though fibrous anchylosis may supervene, osseous anchy- losis can only occur after the cartilages with the articular lamellae of bone have entirely gone, and there is no necrosed bone left to keep up the disease; for, with VOL.

Head of femur altered by disease— removed by excision. Prep. ISIS33 tins complication, a natural recovery cannot take place till the source of irritation has been discharged by natural processes, or, removed by art. When, therefore, suppuration occurs in a hip-joint, though recovery may follow with partial movement, there is but one result a surgeon can reasonably look for and strive to secure, and tbis is anchylosis; and if by the history of the case and the clinical symptoms he can make out that the disease began in the synovial mem- brane, aud that tbe suppuration was tlie result of pathological changes in that tissue alone, the hope of secur- ing this result is very good; for the disease in the joint, under these cir- cumstances, however extreme it may be, is probably only superficial, and does not involve the bones to any extent, so that a good recovery with a stiff joint may fairly be anticipated. If, however, the history of the case and the clinical symptoms indicate disease of the bones, the probabilities of tbe same result taking place will rest upon the amount of the disease, and if the disease in tbe bone be superficial, a natural cure by anchy- losis may be looked for; since dead bone, if not too large, and even tbe epiphysis, may be discharged externally, and a good recovery follow. When, however, the disease in the bone is extensive (Fig. 551), or a sequestrum is so placed in tbe centre of the bone as to keep up irritation and interfere with repair, as is shown in Fig. 533, the surgeon’s active interference will be imperatively demanded, and it may be added, that it is never practised with better results. Under all circumstances, however, the first point in treatment is, to secure the complete immobility of the limb, which can be ensured by splints; ex- tension should likewise be kept up by means of weights, or elastic forces. In one case a long outside splint may be enough, while in another the weight is sufficient. In very chronic cases an immovable casing of leather, gutta percha, felt, wire, perforated zinc, or other appliance, such as the fancy or in- genuity of the surgeon suggests, is the best; abso- lute immobility of the joint, prevention of inter- articular pressure, tonic treatment, liberal regimen, good air, and time, being essential conditions for a successful issue. Fig. 552 represents a good appa- ratus to ensure immobility when the patient is in bed, though tbe double splint figured 550 is better; for with it abduction and adduction of the affected limb are prevented, tbe pelvis isfixed at a right angle to the spinal column, and tbe external malleolus of the affected side is kept in a line with the hip, elastic extension being maintained through an accumulator over a pulley inserted in the cross foot-piece. Mr. C. De Morgan’s long Fig. 552. Immovable casing for hip disease.ON THE TREATMENT OF HIP-JOINT DISEASE. 467 splint (Fig. 515) is also good, applied to the side of the sound limb, through which he likewise applied all counter-extension. When mal-position such as arises from flexion, abduction, or adduction of the thigh exists, a position which would be detrimental to the patient’s welfare, it is essential that it should be remedied before the plan of treatment already laid down is carried out, and so long as no anchylosis has taken place, or the union is soft, there is a good pro- spect of this being effected. For this purpose, chloroform should be given, and the thigh slowly hut surely brought to a straight line with the body, and there fixed; any inflammation caused thereby being checked by the local application of ice or hot fomentations, according to the comfort one or other gives the patient. At times, however, active disorganizing changes and bad results follow. When dis- placement or dislocation of the joint exists, it is often in the surgeon’s power to reduce the dislocation, and then to treat the case as one of the ordinary kind. In the case from which Fig. 553 was taken, the hoy was eleven years old; the disease had been acute, and the dislo- cation was on the ilium. Its reduction was readily effected under chlo- roform, and a good result followed. A weight of six or seven pounds was enough to keep the limb in position, and the counter- extension was well applied on the opposite side of the pelvis. If, how- ever, I had now the treatment of this case, I should have employed the double splint with elastic extension. When the displacement is of long standing and the natural cure of the disease has gone on to its end, it is not wise to interfere and thus run the risk of undoing what nature has well done; as many of these cases of supposed dislocations are not of this kind; but simply a shortening of the neck of the bone from the absorption or destruction of the head or epiphysis of the femur, or, at times, of the acetabulum. Drs. March and Sayre, of New York, deny the existence of a dislocation, but in this they are wrong. It does occur, although rarely. In the case from which Fig. 553 was taken, it was very clear. In exceptional instances the displacement of the iimb is due to a separation of the neck of the bone from the epiphysis, which is left fixed in the aceta- bulum, or is cast off. This condition is illustrated in Figs. 537-8. When anchylosis has taken place at a bad angle, at such an angle as seen in Fig. 554, any attempt at forcible flexion with the view of breaking down the ad- hesions, must he looked upon as futile and unjustifiable, although it may be right to consider the propriety of improving the position of the limb by some surgical procedure; and/or this object, several surgical opera- tions have been devised. Thus, in 1875, M. Tillaux presented before the Surgical Society of Paris a woman, set. 32, the subject of bony anchylosis of the hip-joint of a year’s standing, the limb having been flexed and rotated inwards, for whom he had with success, forcibly fractured the neck of the Fig. 558.

Operation described. He subsequently treated the case as one of fracture, and at the end of two months the patient had a straight limb. M. Tillaux described the result as splendid, and considered the practice infinitely preferable to the operation of subcutaneous section of the neck of the bone. The operation is, doubtless, of value in certain cases, and worthy of consideration. In 1869, Mr. W. Adams (‘Brit. Med. Journal,’ 1870) successfully treated a case of this nature by subcutaneous division of the neck of the thigh bone by means of a fine saw, and up to October 1876, twenty-two operations of the kind had been performed—five by Mr. Adams, four by myself, and others by Messrs. Jessop, Jowers, Jordan, Lund, of Manchester, Sands of New York, Golding-Bird, and others. The operation was successful in twenty. I look upon this operation with much favour, and believe it to be the best when the femur has a neck to be divided. The instruments required for the operation are such as those figured below (Fig. 556), The operation itself I give in Mr. Adams’s words: Fig. 556. J | i'nON THE TREATMENT OE KNEE-JOINT DISEASE. 469 “ I entered the tenotomy knife a little above the top of the great tro- chanter, and carrying it straight down to the neck of the thigh-bone, divided the muscles and opened the capsular ligament freely. Withdrawing the knife, I carried the small saw along the tx-ack made— pursuing this by pressure of the fingers— straight down to the bone, and sawed through it from before backwards, in the direction represented in Fig. 557, which shows the saw applied to the anterior surface of the neck of the bone. The section of the bone was accomplished in four minutes. No haemorrhage followed, and a good recovery took place with a stiff limb.” When the saw is used, it should be held at an angle of 135° to the line of the shaft of the femur (Fig. 557). A narrow chisel, however, is an equally good instrument for the purpose. In my four cases the neck of the thigh bone was readily divided in less than five minutes, and the wound above the tro- chanter healed in a few days; the boys walking in eight weeks. I did not attempt to obtain movement in any, being well satisfied with the results secured; although before I operated on the last, I was alive to the fact that my friend Mr. Lund, of Manchester, had operated with such success upon a man who had both liip-joints anchylosed in a straight line with the body, and, as a consequence, could not sit, that after the operation excellent motion was obtained in each liip-joint, and the man could 3it up in a chair with the body nearly perpendicular, and the thighs comfortably placed on the seat; he could moreover support the weight of the body upon the legs. (‘ Brit. Med. Jour.,’ Jan. 29,1876.) When there is no neck of the femur to be divided or the muscles \y|len tjlere and soft parts about the minor trochanter of the bone are so contracted is no neck to and rigid as to render it probable that the shaft of the femur cannot ,lle hone, be brought down to a right line, Gant’s operation (‘ Lancet,’ Dec. 1, 1872) should be performed; that is, the femur should be divided by a Gant’s small valvular wound subcutaneously below the trochanter, either by operation, means of the saw as employed by Adams, or chisel as suggested by Volckmann and advocated by Maunder, the same care to exclude air being employed in the operation as has been advised in Adams’s. Both these operations are superior to Barton’s, who divided the femur between the trochanters, and to Sayre’s, who excised a wedge of bone from between them. Fig. 557.

When disorganization of the joint ensues, few cases are more serious in their local as well as their general effects, as life is often endangered, and recovery with a stiff joint must he regarded as favorable. When the disease is the result of septicaemia, or rupture of an abscess into the joint, the success is no better. In subacute and chronic forms of synovitis, a good result may, as a rule, be promised, and the treatment must be regulated by the cause of the disease. In traumatic cases, the local application of cold or warmth, according to the amount of comfort one or other affords, and keeping the limb immovable by means of splints, are the best means to use; and gentle support, by means of well-applied strapping, is a valuable adjuvant when only a relaxed condition of joint remains. In other cases, the application of a blister to either side of the joint as well as the internal administration of the iodide of potassium, with or without bark or quinine, according to the necessities of the patient, are of great use. When gout appears to be an element in the affection, it is advisable to administer colehicum, lithia, and other remedies approved in that disease. When the case appears to have a rheumatic origin, alkalies, such as the bicarbonate or citrate of potash, &c., may prove serviceable; and, when there is any reason to suspect a syphilitic taint in the constitution, it is necessary to employ- such treatment as is peculiar to such diseases, viz. the iodide of potassium or sodium, or some mercurial. In very chronic and obstinate cases, paracentesis of the joint by means of the aspirator may be performed, and, in the hands of some, has been employed with marvellous success. Sir J. Fayrer was one of its strongest advocates, having shown (‘Indian Med. Gaz.,’ 1869) that in the chronic and subacute forms, much good is often obtained by the operation, if care be taken to exclude the air by carefully closing the puncture and fixing the joint on a splint; the drawing off of the fluid affording instantaneous relief. I have performed this operation on many occasions with good results when the tension of the joint was extreme; it is a practice, however, that ought to be followed with extreme caution. The pulpy disease of the synovial membrane is a very obstinate affec- tion, and though fairly curable with a movable joint in its early stage, and occasionally so in a later, is always tedious and unsatis- factory. In its treatment, the absolute immobility of the joint is most essential. This may be guaranteed by the application of a well- adapted splint (Fig. 558), reaching from the foot two thirds up the thigh. As Fig. 558. long as any heat or periodic flushing of the joint exists, the limb must be kept raised, and warm moist appli- cations applied by strips of lint sur- rounding the joint. After these syrnp- Splint for diseased knee-joint.ON THE TREATMENT OP KNEE-JOINT DISEASE. 471 Pig. 558a Bavarian splint as completed for disease of the knee. toms have subsided and tbe products of inflammation alone remain well-applied pressure, by means of strapping, is of great value. Mr. Marshall (‘Lancet,’ May 25, 1872) speaks highly of the five-per- cent. solution of the oleate of mer- cury in oleic acid as an application, and my experience of its use has been satisfactory. Blistering and firing in this affection seem to be of little value. In the very chronic stage of the disease, the Bavarian flannel splint (Figs. 476, 558a), or some other good casing, may be employed. The constitutional treatment in all stages of this affection is essentially tonic, as the subjects of it are always feeble and often strumous; iron, quinine, bark, cod-liver oil, good food, and fresh or sea air are essential elements of successful treatment. By these means, so long as suppuration has not set in, a cure may be effected, although many months may be required for its attain- ment. When suppuration appears, the same principles of practice are applicable. When small deposits of pus form from the breaking down of some portion of the pulpy tissues, and make their way externally towards the skin, and not into the joint, they may be evacuated, and a good result still ensue. But when the joint becomes disorganized from the same cause, questions arise as to the expediency or possibility of saving the joint, but this subject will claim attention in the chapter on suppurating joints In articular ostitis, a disease readily made out in the knee, when simple expansion of the bones (Fig. 547), and an aching pain and heat are the local symptoms, all walking or standing should be positively interdicted; everything like inter-articular pressure forbidden; and fomentations of warm water applied two or three times a day, or strips of wet bandage covered by a handkerchief of elastic tissue or oil silk kept round the joint. Some speak highly of blisters, moxas, and counter-irritants, which I rarely employ, having long found the above practice preferable. When heat has left the joint, the aching, miscalled “growing,” pains disappear, and clinical evidence tends to show that all inflammatory action has subsided—the results or products of inflammation alone remaining, local pressure as applied by strapping not only gives comfort to the patient, but appears to help the absorption of the inflammatory products and the subsequent cure of the disease. Constitutional treatment, however, must not be forgotten, and tonics, as a rule, are needed; cod-liver oil, combined with the syrup of the phosphate or iodide of irons, being a suitable prescription for children. When the appetite is bad, quinine may be given; at other times, non, or other tonic. Good food and good air are as necessary in this as in all other joint cases. The use of the iodine evaporating box should not be omitted. Mercury is unnecessary. In the early stage of articular ostitis, splints are not required, as the joint is not itself diseased, and passive movement of the articulation will not do harm; all inter-articular pressure, however,should be avoided, Constitu- tional treatment.

In a more advanced stage, however, when the disease has so progressed in the bones as to have set up some degene- rating process in the cartilages, and the synovial membrane has become involved, as indicated by effusion or the pulpy synovial thickening, the use of the splint is essential. In neglected cases when the joint has been allowed to assume an abnormal position—the most common being that of flexion, with some amount of rotation inwards or outwards—and in still worse cases where dislocation of the tibia and fibula backwards has taken place, the deformity if possible must be remedied by gradual extension. This should be employed by means of a posterior screw splint, or the appli- cation of a constant gentle force, exerted through one of the many instruments that have been made with the view of pressing the femur backwards and the head of the tibia forwards. Manual extension exerted under chloroform employed with care rarely does much harm; forcible and sudden extension cannot be recommended, as it is followed at times by severe local action and suppuration. In exceptional cases it may be required. Anchylosis.—When a knee-joint has to be fixed, the best position is one of slight flexion, or that which a man naturally assumes when he stands at ease. But anchylosis is more difficult to secure in the knee than any other joint, on account of the presence of the inter-articular fibro cartilages which prevent the bony surfaces from coming in con- tact. Moreover, these cartilages when diseased, are most difficult of repair, no tissue undergoing a reparative process more slowly or im- perfectly. It is, doubtless, from a knowledge of these clinical truths that some despair of securing anchylosis in the knee, and even doubt its occurrence, and are led to interfere by operation oftener than others. Anchylosis of the knee—good solid ossific union of the bones, as well as fibrous anchylosis—does, however, occur, and when secured, is of great value. It gives a limb which is far superior to any other that follows excision, and is, as a rule, obtained without the dangers of an operation, although possibly with the expenditure of more time. I have the notes of many such cases, and in the ‘Med. Times,’ 1870, I published a series in some of which this result took place with and in others without suppuration. Diseases of the ankle-joint should be treated on precisely the same principles as those laid down for the knee, the best position of the foot being at an angle slightly exceeding that of a right angle. Diseases of the shoulder-joint, in their progress and treatment, are very similar to those of other joints. When the shoulder has to be fixed, a leather casing, including the scapula and humerus, is a good apparatus, the elbow being at the same time supported. The arm should be allowed to hang parallel to the trunk, with the elbow slightly away from the chest; and for this purpose Stromeyer’s cushion is of great value. (Fig. 497.) Diseases of the elbow-joint can be usually managed with greater ease than any other—a splint applied in the flexure of the joint, passing well down to the hand to keep the radius in a position intermediate between pronation and supination, being the best. If the hand is left unsupported it is certain to assume the prone position, which, as a rule, is undesirable. Dislocation of this joint, except at the head ofEXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. 473 the radius, which is often displaced backwards and somewhat out- wards, rarely takes place as a result of disease. Before fixing the joint at an angle, it is well in most cases to con- Position of suit with the patient, for in some, the straight position is the more nxingjoini. desirable. In the case of a painter I bad under care, a flexed elbow would have lost him his occupation. In another, of a bargeman, the joint was fixed at a right angle, with the hand pronated, to hold the oar. A carpenter asked me to fix his left elbow at an obtuse angle, and a haycutter nearly straight. In all these instances, any other position would have been most detrimental. In disease of the wrist and carpus, the same position of the hand D|seaMs^°f should be maintained as in disease about the elbow. . _ carpus In disease of the phalangeal joints when anchylosis is to he oh- phalangeal tained, I have of late years always fixed the diseased extremity at joints, such an angle as will allow its point to come in contact with the top of the thumb, having invariably found the straight positions of the finger very incovenient. In this position, the fingers are more useful and less in the way, and the deformity less observed. In these cases, the best material to use as a splint is a piece of zinc or tin, which is firm, thin, and takes up little space. ON OPERATIVE INTERFERENCE—EXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. In the treatment of joint disease, next to the preservation of life, General the aim of the surgeon is, to preserve the natural movements of the remarks, articulation ; and when that hope has gone, to save the limb. If this end can be obtained with a stiff joint, the result in disease of the lower extremity may he regarded as satisfactory, and even in the upper, a stiff shoulder or elbow-joint at a useful angle, is not so bad a result as some would lead us to believe. When neither of these ends appears probable, possible, nor expedient, Questions for from the extent of the local disease, the general want of power of decision, the patient, or the necessities of the individual case, the question of operative interference comes before the surgeon, and he has to decide on the expediency of an incision into the joint, the removal of dead hone from or excision of the joint, or amputation; and to work out the many points involved in the solution of these questions is a task of difficulty, since, from joints having a different value in the human body, a form of practice which is applicable to one may be inexpedient to another. This difficulty, moreover, is doubtless aggravated by the different value which surgeons place on different forms of practice, and the estimation in which they regard natural processes; for one who has great faith in natural processes in the cure of disease, and Varieties of particularly of joint disease, will attempt to save a limb that another opinion will condemn, since he regards any practice as wrong that interferes reaPe=tiue with a natural recovery so long as any reasonable hope exists of se- mterference. curing such a result; and believes that a cure by anchylosis, how- ever acquired and however long a time maybe passed in securing it, is worth the attempt. Another, who has stronger faith in surgical treatment, will excise a joint, believing it to be inexpedient toRule respecting operation. Treatment o suppuration of hip-joint.

When presence of dead hone cannot be made out. 474 EXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. attempt to obtain a natural cure, even if it may be gained, when by excision an equally good if not better result can be secured in a shorter time. And a third looking upon both forms of practice as too protracted and uncertain, will remove the diseased parts by amputation, under the conviction that a more certain result as well as rapid recovery will be secured by such a process. To lay down any definite rules upon operative interference in joint disease generally, is consequently an impossibility, since each joint has its own surgery. It may, however, be stated as a starting point, that no surgical ope- rative interference is justifiable unless a joint has suppurated or become disorganized; and that amputation should only be thought of when all minor measures are inapplicable, and it is necessary to remove the disease to save life. The larger the joint the greater the dangers of operative interference. The Treatment of Suppuration of the Hip.joint. In the treatment of a suppurating hip-joint as of any other, it is most important to ensure a free vent for all discharge, as pent-up matter is always injurious, and with this view a free incision into an abscess connected with the hip, or the free opening of a sinus through which pus slowly flows is sound practice. In the residual abscesses of repairing joint disease, it is well, however, not to incise unless they show a tendency to increase, since many often dry up sponta- neously. When interfered with the pus should be drawn off with the aspirator. On the Removal of Necrosed Bone from and Excision of the Hip-joint. When in a suppurating hip-joint the presence of dead bone can be made out, there can be no question about the propriety, nay, necessity for its removal; and if this can be effected by means of a free incision, nothing more is needed; when the os innominatum is involved, there is no reason against the removal of the sequestrum, since it is certain that so long as dead bone remains to keep up irritation, a cure by natural processes is impossible. An operation undertaken upon the hip-joint, under these circumstances, is scarcely more than any severe operation for necrosed bone, and in all probability is not more dangerous. The joint as a joint has to a certainty disappeared altogether, and a free incision into it will hardly add to the dangers of the case. In a large number of cases, however, this cannot be done, and under such circumstances, when a cure by natural processes cannot be looked for, the best prac- tice lies in excision of the head of the femur, and, if the acetabulum is superficially affected or stripped of its cartilage (the disease being pro- bably secondary to that in the femur) it will undergo a natural repair as soon as the cause of its disease has been removed. When the presence of dead bone cannot be made out, or the weight of evidence tends to show that there is no such complication to inter- fere with a natural recovery, it is still a disputed point whether excision of the head and neck of the femur is a necessary or even justifiable operation. Those who argue against its adoption assert, aud with some truth, that while all these cases of hip disease are capable of aEXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. 475 natural repair in patients who have good or even tolerably reparative powers, yet in those who have not, the operation of excision must naturally fail, since as much power is probably needed to effect a cure after excision as is demanded for the natural repair of an uncomplicated suppurating or disorganized joint. To these latter remarks, however, I am disposed to demur, and while ready to admit, that in all cases of disorganized hip-joint in which there is no disease of the bone to interfere with recovery, a Opinion as to natural cure may be fairly looked for, so long as the powers of the interference, patient keep up, and no signs of failure make their appearance; yet when these signs show themselves, or evidence is adduced that in the battle of disease the reparative are weaker than the morbid processes, and treatment fails to turn the scale in their favour, the expediency of performing excision becomes an open question, which facts must decide; although I may at once admit that I believe the operation under such circumstances, to be not only justifiable but highly advis- able. The removal of the source of irritation acts beneficially upon the patient, and many a case has, after the operation of excision, gone on to recovery, which unoperated upon would have eventually proved fatal, the patient being worn out by suppuration and exhaustive efforts to repair. For facts in reference to excision of the hip-joint I have resorted Statistics of to Hodges’ work, and also to a recent paper by Dr. R. R. Good, of Ken- excision ot tucky; the former giving us a statistical table of cases up to 1861, up‘ and the latter from 1861 to 1868. Hodges supplies 111 cases, 56 of which recovered, and 55 died. Good quotes 112 cases, 52 of which recovered, and 60 died; a little more than half of the whole number of cases thus proviug fatal. I have lost four out of twenty cases, and although I cannot say that in the sixteen surviving, all had useful limbs, I am within the truth when I assert that the majority had; while without the operation, recovery was impossible. Mr. Holmes, too, in his excellent work on ‘ Children’s Diseases,’ gives us 19 cases, of which, in a general way, one third died from the operation, auother third recovered with useful limbs, and the remain- ing third, although not recovering, derived great benefit from the operation. On analysing these cases as to the influence of age upon the opera- Analysis of tion, some valuable facts may be recorded, andout of 46 of Hodges’cases tlie 8,atist>cs operated upon under ten years of age, 15 died, or 33 per cent.; of 37 *"eUence °f cases between eleven and twenty years of age, 21 died, or 57 per cent.; b ’ of twelve cases operated upon between twenty-one and thirty years of age, 7 died, or 60 per cent.; and of 6 cases operated upon over thirty years of age, 5 died, or 83 per cent. The analysis of Good’s cases indicates the same truths, for of the cases operated upon under twelve years of age, 40-6 per cent, died; between twelve and twenty years of age, 60 per cent, died; and between twenty and fifty-eight years of age, 76 per cent. died. ° J Excision for hip disease in young life, therefore, is by no means a Deduction tatal operation, two out of three recovering; while from ten to thirty drawn from years of age, something less than half recover, but after that period it 8tatistics- is full ot danger.

When should excision not be performed. When excision should be performed. On the operation of excision of flip. Sayre’s description of the operation. ance to remember, that it is in young life we meet with the best success in the treatment of hip-joint as of other disease. With the fact, therefore, before us, that in selected cases, excision of the head of the femur is not only a justifiable hut a good operation let us briefly consider under what circumstances it should be performed, and, from the general facts, as learned from statistics, we find two great results come out clearly :—That in childhood the operation is attended with success, two patients out of three recovering, while in adult life it is attended with great danger, at least two out of three patients dying. In the former case, consequently the operation may be entertained under circumstances which in the latter would render it unjustifiable. When, then, should excision of the hip he performed ? And, first of all, when should it not ? It should certainly never he performed where suppuration or dis- organization of the joint has not taken place; because so long as this condition is kept off by surgical as well as by medical skill, a solid hope exists that a cure of the disease may be secured, though by anchylosis. It should not he performed when all evidence tends to show that the hones entering into the formation of the joint are neither extensively involved nor wholly or in part necrotic, and where the general con- dition of the patient under proper treatment i3 fairly maintained. It should not, moreover, be entertained for disorganization of the hip-joint the result of synovial disease, unless very obstinate and extensive and the general health of the patient is clearly yielding to the disease, nor should it ever he performed for acute suppurative disease. On the other hand, it should always be entertained when it is clear that extensive hone mischief or partial necrosis exists, it being tole- . . rably certain under such circumstances that a cure by natural processes is highly improbable; and when the general health of the patient is clearly being sapped by the local disease, whether that disease be in the hones or synovial membranes, or both. The operation of excision is best performed by a slightly curved incision extending from two to three inches above the trochanter along its posterior border to two to three inches below, more room being obtained when required in exceptional cases at the upper angle of the wound by a cross incision. By this incision there is ample room for the rapid exposure and enucleation of the head and neck of the bone, and subsequently for free drainage. There seems also an equal unanimity amongst those who practise excision, that the head, neck, and trochanter (major) of the bone should be removed, the latter, when left, acting as a constant irritant against the soft parts and pelvic portions of the acetabulum, thereby retarding recovery. In the re- moval of the bone, the chain saw is often of great use. When it can be effected, the shaft of the bone may be divided before the head is re- moved. The surgeon should preserve all the soft parts around the bone as much as possible, and, when the periosteum can be saved so much the better. Dr. Sayre, of New York, who has paid special atten- tion to these cases, describes his operation as follows (‘ Brit. Med. Journ./ July, 1871)“ When the disease has gone on to another stage, where sinuses have occurred and discharge pus, when a probe leads down to dead bone, there is nothing to be done but to exsect it by making a small incision above the trochanter major, midway be-EXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. 477 tween it and the crest of the ilium, over the top of the acetabulum, a semilunar incision, the belly of the curve covering the posterior part of the trochanter major going straight down to the bone through the periosteum; you then pull the soft tissues on one side, and taking a small but strong curved bistoury, go as far round the bone on each side as you can reach, at right angles to your first incision, so as to divide the periosteum completely. You then take a strong, firm peri- Periosteum osteal elevator, with a large handle, and the end slightly curved, and ^ go into this little triangle; you peel off the periosteum, and, as a pi a matter of course, all the muscles with it; by opening the joint thoroughly, and turning the head of the bone out, the periosteum is peeled off from the inner portion; you then saw off the bone above the trochanter minor, taking away the head and neck of the bone with the trochanter major. After the operation, if you keep the leg pulled out to its proper length, by putting on a pair of wire breeches, you can send the patient out into the air the next day.” I have given this operation in Dr. Sayre’s own words, and am disposed to think as well of it as of his general treatment of hip disease. His wire breeches, however, I have never used. When the acetabulum is diseased, that is, necrosed, it may be re- Necrosis of moved. In several of my own cases, I removed large portions of the acetabulum, bone, and in one, the whole floor with a good result; indeed, there is bones reason to believe that, when the bone can be removed, the case is not rendered more hopeless; for, as Holmes has well pointed out, there is always a strong fascia which separates the floor of the acetabulum from the cavity of the pelvis, and prevents all contact with the viscera or their cellular connections. After the operation, the wound had better be left open to granulate, After- aud moderate extension should be applied to prevent the end of the treatment of hone from rubbing against the pelvis, my own double interrupted excislon- splint being the best for the purpose (Figs. 507, 550). As soon as the parts have fairly healed, passive movement may be allowed, and it is remarkable to what an extent useful movement is often secured, the patient being not only able to walk upon the limb, but to flex, abduct, and adduct it, nearly as well as he did before, shortening being the only fault. Amputation at the hip-joint may be entertained in hip disease when On the all hope of a cure by natural processes, however ably assisted by art, question of has been abandoned, and when the powers of the patient admit of a ^nyltation reasonable hope of recovery. Also in cases where excision has been per- ip' formed and failed. It is often successful even under these circumstances. Excision of the hip-joint for gunshot or other traumatic affections of Excision of the joint cannot be recommended. The report of Dr. Otis, in the ad- lliPin mirably got-up circulars of the War Department of Washington (No. 2), woutidsf proves this to demonstration, for out of eighty-five cases only eight re- covered; ninety per cent, having proved fatal. At the same time he show's, that, neither by the expectant treatment nor amputation, do better results ensue. He concludes, that excision of the hip may he performed in uncomplicated cases of gunshot fractures of the joint; that if un- successful, it relieves pain and is attended wdth less risk than amputa- tion, although life is probably prolonged for a longer period by the expectant treatment.

West, of Birmingham, that while of eighty-eight cases in which con- servative treatment was employed, seventy-one per cent, died, out of thirty-one cases treated by resection, eighty-three per cent. died. On the Treatment of Suppuration of the Knee-joint. It may safely be asserted that in no case of inflammatory disease of the knee-joint in which disorganization has not taken place should the idea of operative interference be entertained ; as, so long as this change is warded off, a reasonable hope of a cure with either a movable or stiff joint and consequently of a useful limb exists. Exceptional cases may be seen in which this rule is inapplicable, but they are rare. When, however, suppuration has taker, place, the question of opera- tive interference naturally suggests itself, and the surgeon considers whether natural processes are competent to conduct the case to a suc- cessful issue; whether the local disease is of such a nature as to be incurable, unassisted by art, or the general powers of the patient are sufficient to bear up against the demands that of necessity will be made upon them in the progress of a natural cure; and last, but not least, if it is expedient to make the attempt. These questions require for their solution much knowledge, thought, and judgment, a careful weighing of the probabilities of the case and of the cause of the disease. When the disease is in the synovial tissue alone and the powers of the patient are good, a cure by natural pro- cesses, assisted by art, is generally to be secured; for pathologically in such cases, there is no reason why recovery should not take place. Whereas, on the other hand, when the disease has originated in the bone, spread to the synovial membrane, and been followed by disor- ganization of the joint, a cure by natural processes is so improbable, that the removal of the diseased part by some operation is generally * demanded, for pathologically, good reasons exist why recovery can- not take place, and clinically this observation is borne out. It is true in suppuration of a joint from synovial disease, pulpy or otherwise, the result of a so-called rheumatism settling iu the knee, or of a puerperal synovitis, a traumatic synovitis, a gonorrhoeal synovitis, or any other, a cure with anchylosis is by no means uncommon, yet in all these, during their acute stage, the danger is always great, and it often becomes a question whether an amputation is not needed to save life, or to give the patient a chance. Amputations, however, under- taken for acute suppurative disease are mostly fatal, and operations of excision are likewise equally unsuccessful. Indeed, I hardly think either of these operations justifiable under such circumstances, and in this opinion most are agreed. What I believe to be a better practice is making a free excision into the joint—free enough to let out the pus that it contains, as well as to allow a free escape of all as it forms, and the introduction of a drainage tube, together with the daily washing out of the joint with iodine water. No retention of pus should be allowed under any circumstances. When suppuration has been set up in a joint from the degeneration of the pulpy synovial disease, the benefit of a free incision is very great, and it should be practised with a good hope of success before any other operative measure is undertaken. When, however, suppuration in a joint has followed the extension of inflammatory mischief fromEXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. 479 the bones, the hope of securing a good result without operative inter- ference is very slender; since, as a rule, dead bone exists in the joint Removal of to keep up irritation, and as long as it remains a recovery is very dead bone, improbable. It is true, Nature does much in many cases towards this end, but she rarely is competent to effect the cure without surgical aid. In the following cases these points are well seen:— Case.—Disease of the Knee-joint—Suppuration—Removal of Necrosed Bone from the Joint—Recovery with Anchylosis. James W—, set. 17, came under my care in May, 1866, for disease Example, in his right knee-joint of one year’s duration, which had followed a fall upon the part. Swelling appeared directly after the accident, attended by severe constitutional disturbance and local pain. Suppu- ration also rapidly followed, and several large openings made their appearance eight weeks after the accident. When I saw him, the joint was enlarged from inflammatory thickening of the soft parts, and was clearly undergoing anchylosis. The sinuses were discharging, and a probe passed into one readily detected dead bone in the joint. In September the man was admitted into Guy’s under my care, and on October 13tb, through a moderate incision made on the inner side of the patella, two flat pieces of what were clearly the articular facets of the tibia, were removed. Rapid recovery and firm anchylosis of the joint followed. Case.—Disease of the Knee-joint as a consequence of Articular Ostitis of Tibia—Removal of Sequestrum from Bone—Recovery with an Anchylosed Joint. Henry R—, ret. 14, came under my care at Guy’s Hospital on May Example. 1 17th, 1867, for extensive disease of the shaft of the right humerus u and head of the left tibia with sinuses which had existed for several l' years. The left knee had been enlarged from effusion for a year, (but had never suppurated. When admitted, there was necrosis of the shaft of the humerus and likewise of the head of the tibia, while dead bone was readily felt with a probe in both parts. In the tibia the bone was clearly near the joint, which was enlarged from expanded bone and thickening of the soft parts around. There was I no effusion into the joint, and hardly any movement in the articulation. In November, 1867, I removed a mass of diseased bone from the tibia, 1 and fixed the leg upon a splint. In January, 1868, I removed a | sequestrum from the arm, which included nearly the whole shaft of the | humerus, and a good recovery ensued. In six'months the patient left I the hospital with a stiff knee and a sound arm. Case.- -Disease of the Knee-joint as a result of Articular Ostitis ending in Necrosis—Amputation—Recovery. Edward L— act. 14, came under my care at Guy’s Hospital on Example September 8th, 1868, for disease in the left knee-joint of seven years’ standing which had been discharging for many years. On admission, the left knee-joint was completely disorganized and much enlarged;480 EXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. Probe pointing to abscess in the tibia. fibula. Remarks on the foregoing cases. When operative interferen necessary on diseased knee. it was also partially ancliylosed. Below the joint, a sinus existed leading into the head of the tibia, and through this sinus dead bone was felt. The boy's health was very bad, and it was clear that nothing but am- putatiou could be entertained. His urine was albuminous. The operation was performed on September 17th, and a good recovery ensued. On examination of the joint which was disorganized the head of the tibia was found to be perfor- ated with a channel which led from the joint to a mass of necrosed bone, and the articular facet of the tibia was likewise necrosed. The disease in the joint clearly had been secondary to the disease in the bone. The preparation is depicted in Fig. 559, and the drawing shows well the condition of the tibia. Remabks.—These three cases show well the results of articular ostitis when passing on to necrosis in the knee- joint, and fairly indicate the kind of practice that should be applied. In the first case, nature had done her utmost towards obtaining a cure, the knee of the patient having been on admission partially anchylosed; and, had it not been for the presence of the necrosed articular facets of the tibia, a complete natural recovery would have taken place. The surgeon’s duty in this case was clearly to remove from the joint what seemed to be the sole obstacle to a natural recovery, the necrosed bone, and the complete success of the treatment justified the step, for the boy ultimately had an admirable limb. In the second case, the disease was of precisely the same character, and natural processes had, also, done their utmost towards the establishment of a cure, but the presence of necrosed bone in this case, as in the former, interfered with the recovery and prevented its realisation. On the removal of the bone from outside the joint, natural processes went on without interruption towards the attain- ment of their end, and a complete recovery with anchylosis, was obtained. In the last case, the same cause, articular ostitis, and the same result, disorganization of the joint, were clearly present; but the local disease in the bone was too extensive to allow of any hope of good being derived from its removal, while the general condition of the patient was too precarious to allow of the attempt. As a con- sequence, the only operative interference that seemed justifiable was car- ried out, and the issue of the case was all that could be desired. In dis- organization of a knee-joint, therefore, the result of articular ostitis, of an abscess in the epiphysial extremity of the bone bursting into the joint, of disease in the epiphysial cartilage between the shaft and epi- physis, or, of a sequestrum in one or other of the bones entering into its formation, some operative measure is usually required; and, when the diagnosis of the case is tolerably clear, the practice ought to be decided, as delay cannot be of any use. The disease must be removed. I'm. 559. Abscess of tibia, burrowing into knee-joint with necrosis.EXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. 481 What ought that practice, then, to he ? Should it be excision or am- Question of putation ? Let us refer to facts to help us towards a solution of these points. I have a table of 294 cases of amputation of the thigh for chronic disease of the knee-joint, at various ages, and Mr. Mac Cormac tabulates 137, the total making 431. Of these, 96 died aud 335 Statistics of recovered, the mortality being 22 per cent., or 1 in 5. On referring °Pera 10n- to Dr. Hodges’ work, I find 178 cases of excision of the knee un- dertaken solely for chronic disease of the knee, of which 70 died, aud 108 recovered, the mortality of excision being 39 per cent., or 1 in 2£ cases. In this comparison, the circumstances are exactly similar; both operations being undertaken for chronic joint disease, and the mortality is exactly double. In my table of amputa- tions, I have carefully guarded against any fallacy, and have in- cluded only my own statistics,1 Mr. Callender’s,2 Mr. Mac Cor- inac’s,3 and Mr. Holmes’,4 all of which are equally indisput- able ; and in the table of excisions I have gone to Dr. Hodge’s work, who, to make this point certain states, that with three exceptions performed for acute inflammation of the articulation, excision of the knee has probably never been undertaken for any other than chronic disease or white swelling. Mr. Swain, the author of the Jacksonian Swain’s prize essay on “ Excision,” and a warm advocate of the operation, has given us statistics on this subject, and from his book (pp. 62 and tte kuee.° 64) I have extracted the following facts:—Up to 1865, there had been 316 cases of excision of the knee. Of this number 85 died, or 26'8 per cent.; 9 of these died after amputation which bad been performed in 39 cases after excision. Since 1865, 74 cases are given, 25 of which died from the operation, or 33'7 per cent.; 4 also died out of 11 that underwent subsequent amputation; in all, 29 cases out of the 74 died, or 39 per cent. Mr. Swain gives us also a select list of cases numbering 82, of which 15 died from the effects of the operation, while 4 others recovered after amputation. We have thus 472 cases of excision of the knee and 129 deaths, or 27‘3 Results of per cent., 13 of these being after amputation; 41 other cases underwent 47~ cases ?f amputation and recovered. Taking the whole number of 472 cases, 302, the knee? or 63-9 per cent, recovered after excision; 41, or 8'7 per cent, recovered after secondary amputation; 129, or 27’3 per cent., died after excision : the mortality from excision was thus greater than from amputation in the same class of cases, the relative proportion being 27 to 22 per ! cent. “ It is also,” adds Holmes, “ a somewhat suspicious feature in Mr. Swain’s table that all the 302 recoveries are claimed as being with ' useful limbs. If the information had been at all adequately full, there ; would surely have been a category of recoveries with the limb more or 1 less useless ; ” since it is a well-known fact that the utility of the limb i in many cases in which it seemed perfect at first becomes destroyed by subsequent changes. In childhood, suspension of growth is not an unfrequeut result, and, when the whole epiphyses are removed, it is io he looked for. It is true that Mr. Swain gives somewhat dif- Criticisms of ferent results from the same statistics, as he actually numbers amongst s"'a.m’8 the recoveries after excision, all cases that subsequently underwent am- statl8tics' putation, thus of course giving a far too favourable colouring to the operation he is advocating. 1 ‘ Med.-Cliir.

Results of excision and ■imputation at different period* of lue. Excision (iui'ing young life more fatal than amputation. General conclusion. Excision as a rule is not sound practice. If, however, we look to the results of loth operations as performed at different periods of a life, a point of comparison of immense im- portance although entirely ignored by Mr. Swain and other advo- cates of excision, and I wish its advocates would consider well these points and not pass them by as of no importance, the following ; striking result comes out:—In my own table of amputations fo'r chronic disease of the knee in patients under twenty years of age, out of 69 cases only 3 died, or 4‘3 per cent., or 1 in 23 cases. In ex- cision for the same class of eases performed at the same period of life, out of 97 cases 27 died, or 27‘8 per cent., or 1 in 3f, the different degrees of mortality of the two operations under twenty years of age being as 4-3 per cent, to 27-8 per cent. Excision being nearly • seven times as fatal as amputation during young life, it may thus fairly be asked whether the advantages of excision are so great as to justify its performance in the majority of cases of disease of the knee at that age. In amputations undertaken between twenty-one and forty years of age for chronic joint disease, out of 119 cases 38 ■ died, or 32 per cent., or 1 in 3 ; in excision, undertaken under similar I circumstances, out of 74 cases 39 died, or 52 7 per cent., or more than j 1 in every two cases, the difference between the mortality of the two operations, 32 per cent, and 52'7 per cent, respectively, being 20 per ! cent, against excision. Summary.—It would thus appear that it is in young adult life that excisions, although always more fatal than amputation, are the most justifiable; that in childhood they are far too dangerous; while in patients past middle age, all admit their inapplicability. And yet it must be admitted that excision of the knee-joint is a good opera- I tion; and that by it, when successful, a far better limb is given than after amputation. The truth must be recognised, however, that the operation is, as hitherto practised, much more fatal than ampu- j tation; although it may with confidence be asserted that the cases ! in which amputation has been performed are, as a rule, far more severe than those in which excision has been practised; for the advocates of excision are disposed to operate at a somewhat earlier period of disease than the advocates of amputation; that is, the former often remove a disease they believe it is inexpedient to leave to be cured by natural processes; whilst the latter only remove a limb when all hope of a natural cure has passed away, and the operation is a necessity to save life. Are the advantages of excision, therefore, so great as to justify a surgeon in submitting a patient to an extra risk in order to secure them ? As hitherto prac- tised, and as a general rule in surgery, I have no doubt in answering in the negative. In exceptional cases, the risk, it is true, may be run; but excision, as a rule of practice, does not appear to be sound. Whether better results would not be secured by an earlier opera- tion is an open question. Prof. Humphry’s cases recently published, and my colleague’s, Mr. Howse, rather tend to show they would; for, after excisions, undertaken with a patient in good health, or at least not worn out by suppurative mischief, a good result may fairly be expected. But is the risk of the operation when performed under these favorable circumstances, so slight as to justify the sur- geon in throwing aside the hope, and perhaps fair expectation, of securing a recovery by natural processes ? Is excision of the kneeEXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. 483 to be an operation of expediency and not of necessity ? We want Is excision of facts to prove this fully; but, as far as present experience goes, it ^oneoV0 seems to show that, if the operation is to be a successful as well as expediency? a general one in surgery, it must be undertaken at a somewhat earlier period of disease than that at which the question of amputation has to be mooted; that it should be performed before surgical fever has reduced the powers of the patient, and complete disorganiza- tion of the joint has taken place. In fact, it should not be practised When when an operation is demanded to save the life of a patient, excision for under such circumstances a better chance is given by ampu- practised0' b° tation, but when the local disease is found to be steadily progress- when ing in spite of treatment, and disorganization is threatening. As advisable, a substitute for amputation undertaken in extreme disease to save Summary of life, facts tell against the practice; as an operation of expediency to results, gain time, the few facts we possess tell in its favour. For my own part, I am disposed to think, that under these circumstances there seems to be some hope that excision may not only be a successful, but also a justifiable operation, and that it will not necessitate an in- creased risk to the life of the patient. In doubtful cases, amputation is the more desirable as it is the safer operation; and since the great object of our profession is to prolong and save life, other objects ought always to be subsidiary to this great aim. In acute suppuration of the knee, excision is never successful. Excision for gunshot wounds has Excision in been proved to be most unsatisfactory; indeed, as a practice in such acute cases, it seems hardly justifiable. In compound dislocation it has been for^uusho” successful. Canton and M. Spillmau have published such cases, but wounds, upon the whole, the evidence we possess is not much in its favour in In compound traumatic cases. Resection in cases of deformity as a consequence of dislocation, disease is probably a better field for the operation; and Drs. Barton and Buck, of New York, have demonstrated its value. The operation.—The best incision is that practised by Fergussou, and °n die suggested by Park; a straight one across the joint below the patella from ^l^'ion'off the 'posterior edge of one condyle to the corresponding part of the other, the lame. When the tissues over the knee are bad, the incision may be curved, forming a flap. The old HshaPe(i incision is now rarely practised. Humphry follows Mackenzie in making the semi-circular incision with the convexity downwards, and Bickerstetli, of Liverpool, makes a vertical incision on the inner side of the patella. The joint should be opened at once by dividing the ligamentum patellae and the capsule of the joint, an assistant flexing the leg fully upon the thigh, thereby facilitating this part of the operation. The soft parts ought then to he turned back off the patella and that bone removed, there being no object in leaving it, but many reasons for its removal. The joint having been freely exposed by the division of the lateral and other ligaments, and by the forcible projection of the condyles, the lower two thirds of the carti- laginous extremity of the femur is to be excised, care being taken not to injure the popliteal vessels which lie in close contact behind; the whole of the epiphysis should not be removed. This section should Section of the be made completely at right angles to the shaft of the bone. bolies- The articular surface of the tibia must then be dealt with in the same way, no more of the bone being removed than is ne- cessary. To do this, the bow saw known as Butcher’s is the best, the section being made from behind forwards. In both hones, when48i EXCIISON AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. 1,! ’ lfc w,e11 not t0 encroach upon the epiphysial cartilage, in dividing the bone, care is required not to strip off the periosteum above the line of section. When the surfaces are not healthy or they do not come together iu a straight line, another section may be made, it being a point of primary importance that a perfect adjustment of the bones should be secured. To aid this, the osseous suture, as first employed by Gurdon Buck, and practised by Nelaton and some English surgeons is to be recommended.

Dr. Humphry first fixes the limb upon a posterior splint and foot- piece, then uniting the edges of the wound by sutures, he applies well- padded long splints to the sides of the limb, the wound being left exposed. “ I am very particular,” he writes (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. lii), “ to adjust things well and firmly in the first instance, and am very unwilling to disturb the limb afterwards. Indeed, I frequently do not remove any of the bandages or splints for five, six, or more weeks, and by this care and perfect quiet I endeavour to promote immediate union. This perfect quiet and abstinence from removal of the ban- dages first applied is, I consider, a very important item in the treat- ment. It is equally important not to discontinue the splints till theEXCISION AND AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE. 485 bones are quite firmly united, till the patient can raise the limb from the bed by its own muscles, without any movement being perceptible between the tibia and femur. It is necessary to make quite sure of this.” Dr. Humphry adds “ that excision of the knee is not an operation of much dangerbut it must be remembered that he has little or no faith in the cure by natural processes. He believes such a cure in the bulk of cases to be hardly worth the attempt, and advises that excision should be employed early so as to bring about by operation that condition which we would gladly see attained without such interference. ON SUPPURATION OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. When the ankle-joint has undergone disorganization and is sup- purating, the benefit to be gained by a free incision into the joint is very great, a cure with a movable articulation being often obtained by these means. When this end is not secured, a recovery by anchy- losis may be looked for, it being exceptional for any more active inter- ference to be required, except when the bones are extensively involved. When necrosis of one of the bones entering into the formation of the joint is present, recovery may be looked for on the removal of the diseased bone. In the case illustrated in Fig. 561 I removed the necrosed upper half of the astragalus with an admirable result, and a good foot Fig- 661. with some amount of movement was secured. Under these circumstances, excision of the joint has been practised and with success. I have performed this operation on three occasions, and in two with a good result; in the majority of cases of disorganized ankle-joints I have obtained good results by the expectant treatment and free inci- sion. Excision may be expected to be successful when the disease is limited to the articular surfaces of the bones, and it is in such that the treatment by incisions and the expectant principle is so successful. When the disease is very extensive, it is still a question whether amputa- tion is not probably a better practice. Stokes, however, has collected fifty-one cases of excision, thirty-eight of which were successful, and in the ‘ Dublin Quart.’ for 1870,°an excellent example by Dr. Murney may be referred to. In cases of injury, of compound dislocation, and fracture- into the joint, excisiou is probably a sound operation. Mr. H. Lee has recently adopted it in two cases, and Langenbeck has practised it freely with success. Hancock (‘Lancet,’ 1867) gives 19 successful examples of the operation, quoting Heyfeldcr and Jaeger’s practice in its support. In such cases, however, it seems well to practise it as a secondary operation. With respect to the operation itself, I may quote Hancock’s as practised in 1851, and given bv Barwell with recent improvements.

Examples of success. lower three inches of the posterior edge of the fibula. When it has reached the lower end of the malleolus, it forms an angle and runs down- ward and forward to within about half an inch of the base of the outer metatarsal hone. The angular flap is reflected forward, the fibula about two inches above the malleolus is thus sufficiently cleared of soft parts to allow cutting forceps to be placed over it, when the bone can then be nipped in two and carefully dissected out, leaving uncut the tendons of the peronei longus and brevis. The foot must then be turned over. A similar incision should he made on the inner side, the portion in the foot terminating over the projection of the inner cunei- form bone. The flap ought then to be turned back, and the sheaths of the flexor digitorum and posterior tibial tendons exposed, the knife being kept close to the bone, avoiding the artery and nerve. The internal lateral ligament should be severed carefully close to the bone; and the foot is now twisted outwards, -when the astragalus and tibia will present at the inner wound. A narrow- bladed saw inserted between the tendons into the inner wound will pro- ject through the outer. The lower end of the tibia, and then the top of the astragalus, should be sawn off in a proper direction. The only vessel that may require tying is one of the lower branches of the peroneal artery. The wound can be closed with sutures, except that part opposite the breach of osseous matter; and the leg and foot placed in a splint with a foot-board and cold water applied. Mr. Hancock points out the superiority of total over partial excision of the joint. Mr. Hey, of Leeds, in 1766, was the first surgeon who resected the lower ends of the tibia and fibula for compound dislocation, and Moreau, in 1792, for disease. Hancock, however, was the first to resect the joint as a whole. This operation has grown in favour during the last few years, and in select cases is doubtless beneficial. ON SUPPURATION OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. Suppuration of the shoulder-joint is as successfully treated by free incisions into and the removal of necrosed bone from the joint as the same affection of any other articulation, and only when this treatment has failed or is inapplicable are more severe measures required. Excision of the Shoulder-joint, or rather of the head of the humerus, is an excellent operation in gunshot wounds of the joint, in compound dislocation, or in cases of disease where a cure by natural processes has failed after judicious treatment, owing either to the extent of disease in the bone, or the general feebleness of the patient’s powers. “ The ultimate results of excision of this joint, whether for injury or disease, are very satisfactory,” says Hodges, but they are not more so than the ultimate results of "a cure by natural processes, even with anchylosis; for whatever may be the capabilities of an arm after excision, they are equalled after a natural cure. Under both circumstances, in the majority of cases almost every movementcan be effected except any over- hand one, since the arm cannot be raised above the shoulder. A man whose shoulder I excised fourteen years ago was a coachman in 1872 and could drive a pair of horses with ease. A man upon whom Mr Key operated was subsequently able to carry on his occupation as a ham- merman at a large engineer’s; and another case operated upon by the same surgeon twenty-one years before, in June, 1869, could “shoe horses with any man,” and, as a blacksmith felt no want in his arm. j In gunshot injuries to the shoulder, excision is now a recoguisedEXCISION OP ELBOW-JOINT. 487 operation, tlie experience acquired in the American war having its value in decided the point. Dr. Otis (Circular 6) has recorded, that in 252 gaastiot cases of primary excision, 23 per cent, died; and in 323 secondary, 38 per cent.; primary excisions being thus more successful than secondary. In cases, also, of tumours involving the head of the bone other than cancerous, excision is an operation of value. The Operation.—The best incision is the vertical, from the acromion Operation of process through the thickness of the deltoid down to its insertion. 1 * o1 Some make an anterior in front of the deltoid. Nelaton used the s transverse and Aston Key the deltoid flap. When the vertical incision is made down to the bone, its head should he successively rotated out- wards and then inwards, the surgeon making a transverse cut across the tuberosities to divide the insertions of the scapular muscles. The capsule may then be divided, aud the head of the bone turned out of the wound aud resected through the tuberosities. The long tendon of the biceps needs no special attention, as in cases of disease it has probably long gone or become fixed to the groove, and after resection 1 of the joint is of no value. When the glenoid cavity is diseased, that is, when dead bone is detected in it, it should be removed; but, in a general way, it requires no treatment. When the vertical incision is employed, it is expedient to make an opening posteriorly through the soft parts at a point corresponding to the upper end of the humerus for the purposes of drainage—this opening being kept patent by means of a drainage tube. Whatever vessels are divided should be twisted; and the posterior circumflex artery at time gives trouble. After the operation, the arm should be abducted and placed on a pillow, the edges of the wound carefully brought together, and water dressing or dry lint applied. As soon as repair has fairly taken place, the patient may get up, the arm being well supported in a sling. Three or four months, however, are usually required before a useful arm is secured. In this operation, M. Ollier makes much of preserving the perios- Ollier advises teum, turning it back off the bone with all the soft parts by means '^en-HUo t of raspatories. This is not so difficult in cases of disease as might of be faucied, a cut with a strong knife down to the bone should so divide periosteum, all the soft tissues over the bone as to give admission to the edge of a raspatory for the purpose of turning them back. Ollier has done this on four occasions with success. In resecting the bone, no more need be removed than is necessary beyond the head and half the tuberosities; but, when the section is not healthy, another may be made. Four or five inches of bone have been removed in some cases, and yet a useful limb remained. ON SUPPURATION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. There is a great difference amongst surgeons as to the treatment Treatment of a suppurating elbow-joint. In the Scotch school, excision is em- ol ployed very freely, under the belief that a better arm more generally m elbow.10" follows such a practice than results from a cure by natural processes, and that a joint with better movement is secured in a shorter time. I cannot say that I agree in this opinion, for in elbow-joint disease, where pus is let out by free incisions aud good reparative power is present, recovery with a movable joint, and one admitting of pronation and supination of the hand is by no means uncommon. In other cases, anchylosis of theEXCISION OF ELBOW-JOINT. 488 When excision advisable. Operation of excision of elbow-joint. humero-ulnar joint may take place at a good angle, and pronation and supination of the hand retained; while in another class, anchylosis of both bones may take place with a very useful arm; and this result is secured by no greater expenditure of time than is required for repair after excision, and without the risks of an operation. In synovial disease ending in disorganization, this result is far from being uncommon; indeed, in such cases excision is rarely called for. In hone disease ending in necrosis, however, the same rules do not apply, for under such circumstances, no operation is of greater value than excision. (Fig. 562.) In all cases of disease of the elbow-joint in which natural processes are incompetent to effect a cure, excision should be performed; ampu- tation being had recourse to only when excision is inapplicable or has failed. In cases of compound dislocation, or fracture into the joint, excision is an excellent operation, and to gunshot wounds the same observations apply. Amputa- tion of the arm for injured elbow ought to be performed in quite exceptional cases. Several inches of bone may be taken away in the operation. Mr. Tudor, of Dorchester, removed five inches, the patient subse- quently having an arm capable of extensive motion in every direction, and with which he could lift a heavy chair (‘ Med.- Chir. Trans.,’ 1858). Operation.—The best incision is the vertical one over the ole- cranon process as practised by Langenbeckancl the French sur- geons, extending from three inches above to two below th'e joint, the incision dividing all the tissues down to the bones. The soft parts should then be carefully separated from the bones and drawn aside, the ulnar nerve being raised from the inner condyle, with the inner half of the triceps tendon and fascia. No transverse incision across the triceps tendon should be made, it being a very important thing, as recommended by Dr. R. Hodges, of America (‘ Hammond’s Essays,’ 1864), and recently well de- monstrated by Maunder (‘ Brit. Med. Journal,’ 1871), to retain the triceps tendon aud fascia as it passes over the olecranon, with the fascia of the forearm and anconeus muscle; a thick body of muscle and fascia being in this way retained, extending from the arm above to the forearm below, which adds materially to the extending power and subsequentvalue of the limb (Fig. 563). The articular ends of the bones should then be turned out and removed. The surgeon need not be too sparing in his Fio. 562.

Tu all cases tlie whole of the articular facets should be resected, and when the bone at the point of section is not quite healthy a second piece had better be removed. “If only the extreme ends of the bones be sawn off, anchylosis will most likely take place; while if the amount above prescribed, viz. the whole condyloid extremity of the humerus and all the sigmoid cavity of the ulna with the head of the radius, or even little more on both sides, be taken away, free motion may, under favourable circumstances, be expected” (Fig. 564). (‘Holmes’s System, vol. v.) I have at times regretted not having excised enough of bone, and particularly of the humerus; indeed, I strougly advise the surgeon in all cases to be free in his section of this bone, more particularly in excisions for anchylosis. When possible, it is well to preserve the inser- tions of the biceps and brachialis anticus ten- dons by pressing them back from the bones. To preserve the periosteum in the operation as advocated by Ollier and Laugenbeck, does not appear from published facts or scientific reason- ings to be a matter of importance. After the ope- ration, all hsemor- Fig. 564. rhage havingbeen arrested by tor- sion and the ap- plication of cold or very hot water, or, what is prefer- able, iodine water (5ij ad Oj), this mixture checking capillary bleeding, the edges of the wound should be brought together at its ends, a drainage tube introduced, and the arm fixed at an obtuse angle upon such a screw splint as that made for me and figured above, the splint allowing every movement (Fig. 564), moderate pressure being applied and maintained for a few hours by means of a bandage. Absolute rest should be maintained till the wound has fairly healed and the powers of the patient been restored, when passive move- ment should be commenced with pronation and supination of the hand, the object of this operation being not only to remove the disease but to obtain a movable joint. When anchylosis follows, the operation Conditions in a measure is unsuccessful, for it has failed in one of its greatest resulting advantages. In the most favorable cases, the amount of movement lrom. that is obtained is all that could be wished, indeed, it is little less than exclslon' that of the healthy joint; in some cases, however, the joint is too loose like a flail, in others it is stiff, whilst in another class flexion and ex- tension are good, but pronation and supination fail. In Mr. Syme’s case of a man who had acted as a railway guard up to the time of his death, nine years after the operation, when the joint was dissected, the ulna and humerus were united by ligamentous union, and the end of Ball &• socliaVJoinV Splint for excision of tlie elbow, the splint allowiug every movement.EXCISION OF WRIST-JOINT. 490 Partial resections condemned.

Description of operation continued. the radius was polished off and played on the humerus and ulna upon a material much resembling cartilage. If the ulnar nerve be in- jured, much wasting of the muscles must occur; if divided, union of the ends may, however, take place. Syme has recorded such a case. When disease returns, a second resection may be performed, and even a third. When dead bone follows, it may be removed; indeed, nothing should be left untried before amputation is practised. I have per- formed the operation twenty-five times, and have never had to resect a second time, or to amputate; and in two thirds of the cases good movement was obtained. Partial resections of the elbow are to be condemned, as a rule, experience having indicated that they almost always end in anchylosis of the joint. In 1864, however, my colleague, Mr. Birkett, excised the olecranon for local disease following an injury, the man recovering after many months’ treatment with a slightly movable articulation. I have also recently (1877) done the same—a barrow man, set. 38, l’ecovering with a joint fixed at a very obtuse angle, with limited movement. I have likewise removed from a disorganized elbow-joint of a woman, the necrosed olecranon process with a good result, the humerus and ulna subsequently anchylosing, the radius and hand retaining all their movement. ON SUPPURATION OP THE WRIST AND CARPAL JOINTS. In this affection, operative interference is rarely called for, beyond free incisions for the evacuation of pent-up pus, and removal of dead bone, recovery being aided by the absolute immobility of the hand and fingers, and such constitutional remedies as the wants of the indi- vidual case suggest. When, however, such means fail, or the local disease is too extensive or severe to allow of a natural recovery, exci- sion of the joint should be performed. Lister, Hancock and others have had successful examples. The best method of performing the operation is that of Laugenbeck’s, by means of a single free incision over the dorsum of the wrist extending along the centre of the meta- carpal bone of the index finger. By this incision the lower part of the radial artery is avoided, and ample room given for the completion of the operation. Through the opening made the carpal bones can readily be turned out and the bases of the meta- carpal bones with the extremities of the radius and ulna excised ; the tendons of the wrist being held aside with ease. In performing this operation I have been struck with the facility with which it can be effected, and believe it to be preferable to the comparatively difficult and complicated method suggested by Lister, which is to be com- menced by an incision made in front over the second metacarpal bone internal to the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, and running along the back of the carpus, internal to the same tendon as high as to the base of the styloid process of the radius; the soft parts, including the extensor secundii internodii aud the radial artery, being cautiously detached from the bone, external to this incision, and the tendons of the radial extensors of the wrist being also, severed from their attachments, the external bones of the carpus will be exposed. When this has been done sufficiently, the next step is to sever the trapezium from the other bones with cutting pliers, in order to facili- tate the removal of the latter, which should be done as freely as isEXCISION OF WRIST-JOINT. 491 found convenient. The operator now turns to the ulnar side of the incision and cleans the carpal and metacarpal bones as much as can be done easily. The ulnar incision is then made; it should be very free, extending from about two inches above the styloid process down to the middle ot' the fifth metacarpal bone, and lying near the anterior edge of the ulna. The dorsal line of this incision is then raised along with the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris, which should not he isolated from the skin, but cut as near its insertion as possible. Afterwards the common extensor tendons should be raised, and the whole of the posterior aspect of the carpus denuded until the two wounds communi- cate freely together, though the radius is not as yet cleaned. The next step is, to clean the anterior aspect of the ulna and carpus, in doing which the pisiform bone and hooked process of the unciform are severed from the rest of the carpus, the former with the knife, and the latter with the cutting pliers. In cleaning the anterior aspect of the carpus, care must be taken not to go so far forward as to endanger the deep pal- mar arch. The ligaments of the internal carpal bones being now sufficiently divided, they should be removed with blunt hone forceps; next, the end of the ulna is made to protrude from the incision and sawn off as low down as is consistent with its condition, but in any case above its radial articulation. The end of the radius can then be cleaned sufficiently to allow of its being protruded and removed. If this cau be done without disturbing the tendons from their grooves, it is far better. If the level of the section is below the upper part of the car- tilaginous facet for the ulna, the remainder of the cartilage must be cut away with the pliers. The operator next attends to the metacarpal bones, which are pushed out from one or the other incision and cut off with the pliers, so as to remove the whole of these cartilage-covered portions. The trapezium bone which was left in the early state of the operation, can now be carefully dissected out, so as to avoid any injury to the tendon of the flexor-carpi radialis or to the radial artery, and the articular surface of the first metacarpal bone then becomes exposed and removed. Lastly, the cartilaginous portion of the pisiform hone is taken away, but the non-articular part is left, unless diseased, in which case it should be entirely removed. This remark applies to the hooked process of the unciform. No tendons are divided in this operation except the extensors of the wrist. In order to ensure motion After- of the fingers, passive movements should be performed from a very early treatment, period after the operation. For this purpose, Lister places the limb in a splint with the palm of the hand raised by a wedge of cork fixed below it, so that the joints of the fingers can be moved without taking the limb off the apparatus. When the splint is removed some flexible support is required for some time. ( Vide Lister’s paper, * Lancet,’ 1865.) Excision of the joints of the thumb requires no description, and may be Excision of made by a vertical dorsal incision that interferes but little with the ten- joints ot dons of the part. The operation is very good, and should always be per- formed where possible for disease or injury. I have done it on many occasions with a good result, and at times recovery has been followed by movement. In the case of a man with neglected dislocation in which I performed it, hermetically sealing the wound with lint and the com- pound tincture of benzoin, rapid recovery followed with a movable joint. In a second case, in which I excised the phalangeal joint of the thumb a like result ensued.LOOSE CARTILAGES IN JOINTS. 492 Amputation in joint disease, when not to be resorted to. The principle of “ the least sacrifice of parts.” Site of amputation in disease of knee. Site of amputation in disease of ankle. On loose cartilages in joints. Origin and growth. AMPUTATION IN JOINT DISEASE ought never to be resorted to until all hope of a cure by natural pro- cesses has been given up or failed; until incision into or the removal of necrosed bone from the joint has been deemed unsuitable, excision of the joint inexpedient or inapplicable, or the progressive nature of the disease and its sapping powers reveal the fact that if the disease be not removed the life of the patient is likely to be sacrificed. In ampu- tating for joint disease, as for injuries, tumours, or other causes, the principles of “ the least sacrifice of parts” should be followed, and no more of the body, under any circumstances, ought to be taken away than the necessities of the case demands. To carry out this principle the surgeon may, in pathological amputations, fearlessly divide tissues infiltrated with organized inflammatory products, and even cut through the walls of suppurating cavities or diseased joints, more particularly to save amputating above a joint. The value of this practice I have fully illustrated (‘ Lancet,5 Jan. 23rd, 1875). Amputation for disease of the hip, shoulder, and elbow-joint is per- formed in only exceptional cases, and for the knee and ankle, it is yearly becoming less common. Yet it is a valuable operation in proper cases as well as the means of saving many lives. The mortality of amputation for chronic knee-joint diseases, at Guy’s Hospital, is only one in seven, and in young people under twenty years of age, one in twenty. In amputation for disease of the knee, where the end of the femur is sound and the articular facet alone diseased, the surgeon should sacri- fice as little of the thigh as possible, the amputation should be almost at the joint, and the femur divided through its condyles, or just above, as in Stokes’s amputation ; a larger section of bone should only be made when the necessity of the case demand it. In disease of the ankle- joint, when excision and every smaller operation such as the removal of dead bone has been put aside, Pirogoff’s operation should be em- ployed in preference to amputation, if the calcis with the integument over it be sound; or Syme’s amputation, unless the disease of the arti- cular end of the tibia is too extensive. To amputate a sound foot for disease confined to the ankle-joint is a measure which can only be justified by peculiar circumstances, and as a general practice is to be condemned. Amputation of the arm for diseased elbow is still less justifiable, unless the local disease is too extensive to allow of excision, or the powers of the patient too feeble to admit of the attempt. LOOSE CARTILAGES IN JOINTS. Loose bodies, ordinarily called loose cartilages are found in joints, and are most common in the knee, yet are met with in the elbow, ankle, and other joints. They are, doubtless, generally developed in the sub-synovial cellular tissues, and as they increase in size encroach upon the cavity of the joint by pushing the synovial membrane before them, aud appear as warty or more or less pedunculated fringed growths hanging into the cavity. They may be single or multiple, and of all sizes up to that of a small walnut. When one of the masses becomes detached a “ loose cartilage ” is said to be present. John Hunter taught, and Rokitansky believed, that they are formed by the493 LOOSE CARTILAGES IN JOINTS. organization of fibrinous coagula, but evidence is wanting to prove Opinions this view, for roost, as pointed out by Rainey, contain ill-formed carti- ^speeting lage-cells and ossific matter and true bone-lacun;e are at times ^ture. present (Fig. 565). Paget (‘ St. Barth. Hosp. Rep.,’ 1870) has recently . given good evidence of the truth of Teale’s suggestion, that some of these bodies are really sequestra, and that “just as a blow on bone or tooth may induce necrosis and exfoliation without signs of destructive inflammation, so may it with articular cartilage; and the characteristics of these cases will be that after injury to a previously healthy joint, a loose body is found in it, having the shape, and general aspect, and texture of a piece of articular car- i tilage with or without some portion of sub- i jacent bone, and with its cartilage-corpuscles arranged after the manner of the articular cartilage.” Dr. Adams, of Dublin, connects their presence with osteo-arthritis. A report upon these bodies, wfith micro- 1 scopical drawing kindly etched for me by Dr. Goodhart, will help to the solution of some of these points:— “ The term ‘ loose cartilage ’ is applied to two conditions which are Dr. Good- totally distinct; the one where a portion of the normal articular 'Iarl’s rePurt- cartilage has been detached by injury to the joint, and lies loose in its cavity; the other where bodies of more or less consistence, often carti- laginous or bony, are found, and which are new formations. “ Recent observations seem to show that the former of these two is by no means of infrequent occurrence, but it possesses no pathological interest whatever, and needs no description. A very good specimen of this form is to be found in the Guy’s Hospital Museum, 134463. The latter, however, has frequently excited discussion among pathologists; so we will give in a few words what appears to be its usual composition, and our conclusions therefrom as to its mode of origin. Roughly speaking, loose cartilages are generally more or less smooth, of greyish colour, and look, as their name suggests, like pieces of cartilage; but they may be nodulated and composed almost entirely of bony material (Fig. 565 and Prep. 956b, Hunterian Mas.). Even in that case, however, they have a thin film of fibrous material over them still, obscuring the bone, and rendering them cartilaginous lookiug on their external surface. “ The cases (five in all) that we have had an opportunity of examin- [ ing have also shown more or less calcareous matter; they wrere never | pure cartilage. One case in the Guy’s Museum (1344s0), while appearing * cartilaginous, cut with a creaking sensation, and under the microscope 1 irregular deposits of calcareous matter and bone were found in all i directions in its substance. In another (Hunterian Museum Cat., ! 957a) one surface is tuberculated and composed of hard nodules of k ivory-like bone, while in a concavity thus formed is a cartilaginous | mass. The bone on the surface in this specimen can only be compared ; to the nodulated excrescences found at the margins of the articular I cartilages in cases of osteo-arthritis. “The microscopical characteristics vary in each to a certain extent; i some show fibro-cartilage, calcareous matter, and bone; others are en- Fig. 565.

The cartilage in the specimens which we have examined was very fibrous, and the cartilage-cells small. The calcareous matter had evidently not formed after any definite method, or in any pur- posive direction, as should occur in the building up of normal bone- tissue, and the bone had no regular system of Haversian canals or bone- corpuscles. The former occur as spaces of irregular shape and position, and the corpuscles, with hut few canaliculi, are often more like calcified cartilage-corpuscles, and have no arrangement in relation to them. “ Prom this short description, and also from Pig. 565a, it will be seen that the specimens exhibit the formation of bone in its various stages; they show the primary cartilage stage, the secondary calcareous stage, and its ultimate issue in true hone, the bone being, as might be expected, of a somewhat irregular build, of “ Having thus regard to their general structure, it would then seem most probable that since they are in their essence bony, loose carti- lages must form in connection with bone-forming tissue, and these, so far as is known, are found in the involutions of the synovial membrane at the edges of the articular cartilages. This view is consistent also Fig. 56oa. Microscopical appearance of loose cartilage, a. Calcareous matter, b. Small-celled cartilage, in parts more fibrous than represented, c. Bone. with the appearances found in certain joints in cases of osteo-arthritis; such, for instance, as a case recorded by Mr. Wagstaffe in the ‘ Patho- logical Society’s Transactions,’ vol. xxiv, 1873, p. 192; or specimens 954—956b in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In all these the formations may he seen in situ. It is also in accord with tlia generally received opinion as to the more usual formation of loose cartilages at the present time. “ But in connection with this subject the so-called ‘ melon-seed bodies ’ found in joints and in the synovial sheaths of tendons an on bursse must be considered. As is well known, they are geneia y abnormal developments of the synovial fringes, sometimes inflammatoiy, sometimes, perhaps, as was suggested by Rokitansky, due to cysticLOOSE CARTILAGES IN JOINTS. 495 dilatation of the synovial folds, or perhaps to distension and coagula- tion within obstructed follicles. But whether originating in one or all of these various ways, being all in common due to changes in the synovial membrane and sub-synovial tissue, it is evident that they are loose cartilages in miniature, and only want size and the further change into cartilaginous matter to be true loose cartilages. But I have lately had an opportunity of making a very careful examination of some of these ‘ melon-seed bodies ’ from one of the sheaths of a tendon on Melon-seed the dorsum of the hand, which suggested the possibility, not to say bodles- probability, of another mode of origin. I failed to find in any of them any evidence of organized tissue whatever. They contained no nuclei or cell-elements, and were entirely composed of a faintly fibrillated hyaline substance characteristic of coagulated mucus or fibrin. Hence it seems to be quite possible that loose cartilages may originate in a nucleus of fibrin precipitated in the course of a chronic inflammation, and that they subsequently grow by accretion, becoming calcareous by central petrifaction. On this point may be consulted a very interesting case of loose body in the peritoneum, recorded in the ‘ Path. Soc. Trans/ by Dr. Greenhow, vol. xxiii, p. 241. This specimen, in conjunction with * melon-seed bodies, makes one reconsider whether the opinion formed originally by John Hunter may not be correct, that loose bodies in the joints are sometimes formed from the ‘ living principle of the blood/”1 Loose bodies, however formed, give rise to very similar symptoms. Symptoms, produced by the foreign body becoming fixed and pinched between the articular surfaces of the bones. The presence of one of them is usually discovered when the patient is walking or moving the joint, by some sudden inability to move the articulation and a severe and sickening pain, which is relieved only by the cartilage slipping from between the bones, which it usually does by a characteristic snap. Some stiffness and slight inflammation of the joint may follow this Effects. ; injury, which by rest and treatment will subside in a few days, to be renewed upon a recurrence of the accident.

By the Treatment. ( former, the cartilage is left untouched in the articulation ; and by the . latter it is removed or fixed in an unoffending position. In a general way the palliative treatment is the correct one to be enforced, for knowing Palliative, how destructive inflammation of a joint following a wound too often i proves, few surgeons would venture upon an operation without an absolute necessity, and such seldom exists, for by restraining the move- ments of the joint by some leather, felt, or other light casing, the foreign body may become fixed and consequently innocuous; indeed, ' by such treatment, Hilton has shown (‘ Guy’s Reports,’ 1868) that 1 these cartilages may become absorbed. He fixes the loose body by May be means of a pad and strapping at the most convenient spot, and places absorbed, the limb upon a splint. By this practice, pain is preveuted, the peduncle of the cartilage cannot be stretched, nor the cartilage slip between the i semi-flexed bones.

Larrey’s statistics. cartilage the size of a large almond, and in three months, under ob- servation, it gradually lessened until it disappeared. When inflamma- tion of the joint follows one of the attacks of pain, it should be treated on ordinary principles. When, however, the cartilage, by its presence, produces such serious inconvenience as to destroy the value or use of the joint, whether from the frequency of the attacks, the amount of inflammation that follows, or the dread connected with the affection, some operative interference may be justifiable, and the cartilage should be removed either by direct or subcutaneous incision, the latter being preferable; but no operation should be undertaken till all inflammatory action has ceased, and the joint is in a quiescent state. With the view of removing the offending body by direct incision, a splint should be applied and worn for at least a week; the loose body should then by manipulation, or by such movement of the joint as the patient from experience knows will bring the cartilage under the surgeon’s control, be brought up to one side of the joint, and in the knee, its usual seat is on one side of the patella, where it may be fixed with the finger. The surgeon may then draw the skin over it to one side, and cut down directly upon the cartilage, the incision being large enough to allow of its escape. The wound subsequently should be accurately closed by either a pad and strapping, or a pad soaked in compound tincture of benzoin, and the limb kept upon a splint till repair has been perfected. The removal by subcutaneous incision consists in the fixing of the cartilage by means of a grooved or harpoon-shaped needle inserted into its substance through the skin; of, next, the introduction of a tenotomy knife beneath the skin down to the cartilage, and the division by a free sweep of the knife of all the subcutaneous tissues covering it in; then of the dislodgement of the cartilage by the application of strong digital pressure, or tilting it by means of the grooved needle into the cellular tissue of the parts around, and the application of a pad of lint over the spot where the cartilage escaped from the joint; finally absolute rest of the limb upon a splint must be subsequently enforced, and an ice-bag applied over the joint. After this operation, a small blister may be applied over the cartilage in the cellular tissue; Syme having found that by such means the foreign body becomes fixed in its new position and subsequently absorbed. To remove it by a subsequent operation is a recognised though rarely required measure. Mr. W. J. Square, of Plymouth, adopts the indirect opera- tion, but instead of squeezing the cartilage completely through the subcutaneous wound, he is satisfied by simply pressing the foreign body into the subcutaneous opening and fixing it there by compress and strapping. At the Brit. Med. Assoc, for 1871, he related twenty- four successful cases. The subcutaneous operation is, doubtless, in either of its forms, the safer of the two described; the direct incision should be reserved for large growths or when the other has failed. M. Larrey’s statistics (£ Gaz. des Hopitaux,’ No. 67) fairly prove the truth of these observationsOut of 129 cases operated upon by the direct method, 28 were fatal; and only 5 out of the 38 by the indirect. He concludes, after a careful analysis of cases, that the. operation is a serious one when practised by direct incision, and a difficult one by the subcutaneous method, while extraction is more dangerous than the persistence of the affection. He believes the operation is indicated IIOSTEO-ARTHRITIS. 497 by the complete mobility of the foreign body within the joint; the persistence of the accidents caused by its presence, viz. pain, arthritis, and lameness; the failure of acupressure and other means for fixing the position of the foreign body; and the free consent of the patient after having been made aware of its dangers. RHEUMATIC OR CHRONIC OSTEO-ARTHRITIS. This is now a well-recognised affection, thanks to the labours of the On chronic late Dr. R. Adams, of Dublin, and his splendid monograph published rheumatic in 1857; to Prof. Smith, of Dublin, and Canton, of London. It is arti|ritis. chiefly seen in the middle-aged or old, though occasionally in young people. It may attack any joint, but is most common in the hip and Character of shoulder, and generally comes on without any definite cause, yet I have the disease, known it, in not a few, follow directly upon some injury. A large number of cases put up as unreduced dislocations in the different museums are doubtless examples of this affection; the displacement of the head of the bones being the result of the disease. It is unfortu- nately called rheumatic, although it has no apparent connection with what is generally called rheumatism. It has probably acquired the name from its chief local symptom of aching pain in the joint, aggra- vated at night and in damp weather. The disease is at first associated Symptoms with a dryness of the joint, but subsequently with excess of secretion and even to a great extent; with some thickening and expansion of the pathological head of the bones entering into its formation; some eburnation of the wihcMake articular lamella of bone with disappearance of its inter-articular place.

These crests often appear as ridges of bone which can readily be made out, and the plates may simulate a second patella when the knee is the joint in- volved. In the case from which Fig. 566 was taken, all these conditions were readily distinguishable; the bones and synovial capsule being enormously enlarged; the ligaments were so stretched as to allow of some lateral movements in the joint; and the characteristic rough, crackling sensation, which movement of the joint always gives, was most marked.

In the knee-joint, one or both of the condyles of the femur becomes elongated and expanded, the head of the tibia flattened, the patella enlarged, and osteophytes of variable forms and dimensions fringe the margins of the bones. The synovial membrane also will be thickened, and at a late stage of the affection, expanded from effusion, the ligaments in this way becoming elongated and the joint dislocatec. Adams’s “ additamentary bones” or new plates ot bone of different sizes are found within the synovial membrane, with probably some pedun- culated bodies upon its inner surface.499 SUPPURATION AROUND JOINTS. In its early stage, the disease is characterised by local pain, stiffness Early or rigidity of the joint, and local thickening and development of bony sy'"p om • outgrowths, every movement of the joint giving rise to a characteristic crackling. In the later stage, the same pain manifests itself with thickening, bony outgrowths, effusion, greater mobility and even dis- location, and finally, disorganisation. I have a lady under observation in whom this disease is so developed in both knee-joints that the legs are as flails, the bones being enor- mously expanded and the joints distended, additamentary bones and osteophytes existing. She can only stand by means of artificial supports. Treatment.—Little can be done by means of medicine to check the Treatment of progress of this affection beyond attention to the general condition of Arthritis the patient. In the iodide of potassium we possess a drug that cer- tainly relieves pain, and also I believe retards the progress of the disease, the liquid extract of bark or other tonic being a valuable adjunct. When pain is severe, anodynes may he given, such as Dover’s powder, or the bromide of potassium in doses of gr. x or gr. xv, this drug going well with the iodide. Professor Smith, who has paid so much atten- tion to this disease, thinks well of an electuary of guaiacum, sulphur, the bitartrate and carbonate of potash, ginger, and rhubarb. Dr. Adams prescribes the diluted phosphoric acid. Warm bathing is of use, as are also the mineral springs of Germany. This disease, although locally a painful one, does not appear to have a fatal tendency, and unless very neglected rarely goes on to the disorganization of the joint. To maintain rest is not a recommendation to be attended to, as it tends to make the joint stiffen in the early stage of the affection without arresting its progress. In the more advanced stage when “ hydrops When articuli” is present, and the ligaments are so loose as to allow of the hydrops displacement of the joint, some mechanical appliance is called for, such Resent.18 as that afforded by simple strapping, or of some firm leather, felt, or V other casing. In extreme cases, excision or amputation may be required. ACUTE BURSITIS AND SUPPURATION AROUND JOINTS. I have placed these two headings together, as there is good reason to Acute believe that suppuration about the cellular tissue external to a joint is bursitis most frequently the consequence of an acute inflammation of some superficial bursa, and that it is only in exceptional instances such a around connection cannot be traced. Over the knee- and elbow-joints, where this suppuration is generally met with, some blow, fall, or punctured Situation wound may originate an acute inflammation in the burste of these parts, while the thick integument covering them prevents the in- flammatory products making their escape externally, and favours their lateral extension: the abscess consequently in one case, after cover- ing the knee, burrows backwards into the popliteal space or in the other, comes forwards in the arm into its flexure; more commonly how- ever, it shows itself as a painful phlegmonous inflammation over and around the patella or olecranon process. In some examples the suppuration ,s confined to the bursa, while in most, the iiiflamma- tion will be found to radiate from these well-known points. In children however, the connection between the suppuration and bursitis is not so500 DISEASES OP THE BONES. readily made out, and there can he little doubt that at times it does not exist. j Cases in which suppuration around joint most frequent. On diagnosis. Treatment by free incision The severe cases of suppuration around a joint are most frequently met with in children of delicate and feeble frames, and in the badly fed, who are disposed to rapid extension of suppurative inflammation when started by any slight accident, blow, fall, or strain. When these large abscesses appear around the shoulder—a joint that is less liable to disease than any other—it has probably been caused by some strain or injury, when the child is dragged along by a careless or violent companion; or, it may be that the muscles of the parts are injured. At times, it is the epiphysial cartilage placed between the epiphysis and the shaft of the humerus which has suffered. The diagnosis of these cases of suppuration external to the joint is not difficult. On examination it will be seen, that the swelling is ex- ternal to the joint, covering in the well-known points of bone; in the knee, the soft parts probably will be raised from the patella, and fluctuation will be felt above and around it. There will be much local pain, but not so much constitutional disturbance as would exist with a suppurating joint; the joint, moreover, will be capable of some amount of movement without pain, a condition which would be impossible if the seat of the disease were in and not around it. Tbeatment.—There is only one form of treatment on which reli- ance can be placed in these cases, and which consists in giving free exit to the pus. A free incision, consequently, should be made into the abscess over the seat of the bursa as soon as any pus can be detected. The limb should be raised, the joint preserved at rest by splints, and warm-water dressing or a poultice applied, and the joint should be kept absolutely quiet till repair has been completed. When the powers of the patient are feeble, tonics should be given. When the abscess is not opened early, it may open into the joint and produce an acute suppuration. I have known this happen in the knee with a fatal result. In the knee it is often necessary to make a free incision on either side of the joint as well as over the patella in order to prevent burrowing. CHAPTER XXXIII. DISEASES OF THE BONES. On diseases of bone. General remarks. Structure of bone. In a pathological sense, diseases of the bone are identical with those of other tissues, while such differences as exist are due to their anato- mical and physiological peculiarities ; diseased action, under all circum- stances, being materially modified by texture. In the bones, diseased action is thus modified by the presence of the inorganic material which they contain, two thirds of their constituents being earthy, and one third animal. This animal texture includes a fibrous periosteal membrane with cellular tissue beneath, as well as a finer endosteal membrane which lines the medullary canal. These two membranes are intimately con- nected together by delicate vascular and membranous links permeatingDISEASES OF THE BONES. 501 tbe Haversian canals and canaliculi of the bone itself. The exterior of the bone is dense, and derives most of its nourishment from vessels ramifying in the periosteum. The interior of the bone is porous or cancellated, and derives its supply of blood from a distinct nutrient artery which runs in the endosteum, while the capillaries of both anastomose freely through the bone canals. The long bones also are Condition of built up of shafts (diaphyses) and epiphyses; the epiphyses being dis- l)^le“ll° tinct from the shafts during the early years of life, and having their own vascular supply. The shafts and epiphyses are connected toge- ther by means of a layer of epiphysial cartilage, through which, as proved by Professor Humphry, the shafts mainly grow, though inter- stitial expansion has an influence in bone as in other parts. The epiphyses themselves are covered with articular cartilage that derives its nutritive supply from them. These anatomical points thus briefly sketched, are important to remember when the pathological are con- sidered, as most of the peculiarities of bone disease are explicable by’ them. Thus, when a bone is inflamed, it can only be so through its soft .Seat of tissues, its inorganic matter being affected secondarily. The periosteal Jjj |""I'™atioa and endosteal membranes being intimately connected, inflammation originating in one is very liable to extend to the other, and in pro- portion to the nature or amount of this extension will the inflam- mation be periosteal or endosteal, and the affection either periostitis or ostitis. In long bones when disease attacks the shaft, it may become arrested by the epiphysis or epiphysial cartilage, the articular ends of the bones, and, consequently, the joints escaping. In periostitis, however, such a result is not always secured, for the synovial membrane of a joint, in a clinical point of view, may be regarded as a continuation of the periosteum, and pus beneath this membrane may burrow into the neighbouring articulation, or, the inflammation may spread by con- tinuity. With these remarks, the diseases of bones may be considered, dividing them into the inflammatory affections; tumours of bone; atrophy, hypertrophy’, rickets, and mollities ossium. INFLAMMATION OF BONE may be divided into the acute and chronic. The acute may be idiopathic, or the result of some injury—division of Inflammation a bone by operation or compound fracture—and ends in diffused sup- of l,oue* puration and the more or less complete death of the bone. When origi- Acute lorm. nating in the periosteum and not wholly involving the endosteum, the outer surface of the bone may alone die ; when originating in the en- dosteum and not wholly involving the periosteum, the inner portion of the bone may die and the shell escape; the whole bone dying when both membranes have been equally involved, whether commencing in one or the other. The extent and depth of the destruction of bone, or its ‘ necrosis,’ is determined by the extent and intensity of the inflam- matory action, and the degree in which the membranes covering and lining the bone have been involved. Thus on the one hand, Fig. 569, represents the superficial necrosis of the frontal bone of a child, after its exposure from a lacerated wound caused by the gnawing of a ferret, and Fig. 570, a large shell of boneDISEASES OF THE BONES 502 Fig. 569.

Fig. 571 represents a sequestrum, the result of an endostitis, osteomyelitis or ostitis (for all these terms are synonymous) surrounded by a shell of bone newly formed by the periosteum ; while Fig. 572 illustrates the appearance of the limb so affected, taken from life, with the sinuses open leading from the surface of the limb through the soft parts of the shell of new bone to the sequestrum. Fig. 573 represents a bone which died, nearly as a whole, from in- Death of flammation of both membranes, and upon the upper surface of which Fig. 673. fane, faneet/h Per iosteum dead lorn tfeur fane beneath Periosteum.

Death of the bone or necrosis, is not, however, the inevitable result of all inflammation, not even of an acute suppurative inflammation. In chronic cases, other changes occur, • which are well seen in the articular extremities of the long bones, or spongy bones. They may be described as follows, quoting my own words, written in 1859 (on diseases of joints):—In the earliest condition, simple vascularity will be the principal morbid appearance, the cancelli containing more serum than natural; but as the disease advances, the bone becomes larger than natural, this enlargement, in some cases, being very great. Upon making a section of the bone, the saw will break through its structure more easily than in a healthy specimen, its earthy constituents having diminished; and on comparing the structure of the diseased with a healthy bone it will be observed that its cancelli are much enlarged, and the columns radiate from the shaft in a palm-like fashion, as if they had been spread out from downward pressure. When the inflam- matory process is of a tolerably healthy character, parts of the bone will appear denser and more indurated than the remainder, from the organization of the inflammatory deposit, this deposit in bone always becoming osseous; frequently, however, the death of the bone, with a small or large sequestrum, or a local or diffused abscess, is the result. If the denser portion of bone forming the shell is examined, it will be found thinner than natural, and appear as if it had been dilated, in some cases crackling on firm pressure. Where the articular extremity joins the shaft some new "bone may be detected, thrown out as it were to support its dilated body. The articulating surfaces of the bones will in some parts appear more vascular than normal; whilst in other more advanced cases, portions having been thrown off like a slough, will be found loose and lying in the joint, the denser portions of bonej Chronic changes hone undergoes lit inflammation.

In the shafts of bones, changes similar to these are equally manifest, the bone in the early stage first expanding, and, in subjects of better power subsequently thickening from the organisation of the inflam- matory exudation, the bones thus becoming solid and dense, and the subject of a condition known as sclerosis (Fig. 575).

It may be only a few lines in thickness, though at times it is even half an inch (Fig. 577) ; and before it becomes osseous, it can readily be peeled off the bone by means of the handle of a scalpel or a periosteal elevator. It is to this tissue M. Ollier alludes, when he recommends the sub-perios- teal resection of the shaft or articular ends of bone, for it is upon such mainly that the regeneration of a bone or part of a bone depends. Changes analogous to those described as going on in the periosteum, occur in the endosteum or medullary membrane of the bones, although not so well seen. The products, therefore, of a periostitis or endos- titis vary with the character and intensity of the inflammatory process, precisely in the same way and under the same conditions as Acute the products of inflammation vary in the softer tissues.

In local periostitis, a small portion of bone alone may die, and, as oir James Paget has shown (‘Clin. Soc. Trans.,’ 1870), remain quiescent under a puffy or suppurating swelling. The character of the discharge in these cases is of importance, and Character of while pus the result of periostitis differs in no respect from that found in P“^8 a other tissues, in endostitis, ostitis, and osteo-myelitis, it is mixed freely ° with oil-globules. In a striking case of this latter affection in a girl, set. 10, where a free incision was made down to the tibia, the surface of the fluid evacuated was covered with oil cells. Roser has made a like observation. Acute Inflammation of Bone, whether periosteal or endosteal, osteo-myelitis is a very grave affec- Clinical tion, and is chiefly found during the growing period of hone before symptoms of puberty. It occurs, too, in the feeble and cachetic, and in those termed scrofulous; in the shafts of the long bones, and such as are most exposed, of bone, as the tibia and ulna; although it is almost as frequently seen in the femur. The bones of the upper are probably more rarely affected than those of the lower extremity. It is often the result of some local injury or exposure, though as often as not no such exciting cause can be made out. The disease generally is ushered in with a deep aching pain in the Symptoms, bone with local tenderness, intense constitutional disturbance, increase of temperature, and often a rigor. The pain in the limb is speedily followed by swelling which is evidently deeply placed, aud is not marked by any external evidence of inflammation, such as redness; but as the swelling increases, the soft parts covering it become tense andoedematous, and the veins of the part look full, such symptoms indi- ; eating deep-seated obstruction, while any attempt at movement or pres- sure causes suffering.

(Vide I Chapter 1.) When the inflammation is essentially periosteal, more or less wellDISEASES OF THE BONES. 506 Acute inflammation attacking cranial, carpal, and tarsal bones, &c. When attacking articular end of bones. Treatment of acute inflammation of bones. formed pus mixed with blood will be effused; though in feeble subjects it may be only a blood-stained serum containing lymph. In some of the worst cases of this disease, I have seen this effusion very copious. When, as a consequence of this affection, necrosis ensues and is perios- teal in its origin, the outside shell of bone may alone die (Fig. 570) ; but when endosteal the periosteum may escape, thougli the greater part, if not the whole shaft of the bone may become necrosed (Fig. 571). Endostitis being particularly prone to he accompanied by blood- poisoning is, therefore, a far more serious disease than periostitis, whether as a primary affection or consequent upon the latter. Acute ostitis, periostitis, or endostitis may attack the cranial, car- pal, and tarsal bones, the shafts, articular ends of bones or epiphyses; and according to its seat or extent, it may terminate in reco- very or in the complete death of either the centre or shell of bone. The best instance of death of the bone from periosteal inflammation is seen in the ungual phalanx of the finger, the bone dying as a whole some five or six weeks after the first onset of the inflammation, without any attempt at its re-formation. Such cases are generally, but wrongly, looked upon as whitlows. Of the tarsal bones, it is most common in the os calcis, large sequestra being often met with in this bone; perios- teal necrosis is, however, comparatively rare in the calcis, except as a result of injury to its tuberosity. When this disease attacks the articular ends of the bones, acute joint mischief is the general result, and when it follows the division of bone either by amputation, re-section, or after compound fracture, gunshot, or otherwise, it is a common cause of death, and too frequently is the precursor of septicaemia. Sir Joseph Fayrer, who has drawn attention to this fact, in his ‘ Annals of Med. Science/ 1865, looks upon the prominent fungous mass of granulations that is often seen covering the end of an amputated bone as indicative of the affec- tion, and believes that the facility with which the surgeon passes a probe well into the medullary cavity through these granulations, estab- lishes the diagnosis. He gives the general symptoms as pain in the part, cederna and swelling extending down the limb, general fever, with quick pulse and increased temperature, and more especially the reces- sion of the soft parts, including the periosteum, from the bone, which is then left denuded at the bottom of the wound. Jules Roux, of Toulon, first drew attention to this affection, and gave it the name osteo-myelite. It is, however, essentially an endostitis, only of traumatic origin. Treatment.—In all cases of acute inflammation of bone or perios- teum, in which of necessity there must be effusion beneath the dense fibrous periosteal layer, there is no treatment equal to that of a free incision down to the bone; and if the disease is not arrested or modified by this practice, immense relief to pain is rapidly afforded. There is good reason to believe, too, that by such treatment the dis- ease is often limited and even arrested as well as the death of the bone averted; for bone, like other tissue, is very prone to die when subjected to the compressing influence of a confined effusion. When the upper part of the shaft, or the articular end of a bone is the seat of disease, this practice is very important. Before making an incision, there is no need for the surgeon to wait for the formationABSCESS IN BONE. 507 of pus, as to do this is generally to wait too long, for the object of the Importance incision being to relieve tension, it should be carried out as soon as ten- pf tree sion clearly exists. In a case of acute disease of the tibia with severe lnclslon' local pain and constitutional disturbance, I opened the periosteum on -Example, the fourth day before any external evidences of inflammation showed themselves, except turgid veins and bone enlargement. The incision gave vent only to blood-stained serum, but it was followed by imme- diate relief to all local and constitutional disturbance, and a rapid recovery took place. In this case, all evidence pointed to endosteal rather than periosteal inflammation, and yet the hone was saved. If the incision does not save the hone, it relieves symptoms, and what is more, it may limit the disease by preventing the pus from burrowing beneath the periosteum covering the shaft of the bone, into the neigh- bouring joint. This liability to joint complication is, indeed, one of the strongest arguments in favour of the practice. The limb at the General same time should be elevated, and hot fomentations applied; pain treatment, should be relieved by opium, morphia, chloral, or any other sedative, and the general powers kept up by abundance of nutritious food, such as milk; while stimulants should be cautiously administered. Billroth believes that one of the most efficient remedies is painting the affected limb with strong tincture of iodine till vesications form, fresh iodine being applied as the vesicles dry up. When the inflammation ends in necrosis, it requires to be treated When ending according to the mode to be referred to in a later page. in necrosis. Occasionally as an effect of acute inflammation of the periosteum, much blood is effused between the membrane and the bone. I believe this result to be mechanical and due to the rapid separation of the periosteum, and it is always met with in acute cases. Abscess in Bone. Abscess in bone is the result of a local inflammation, and may or Abscess in may not be associated with the death of a small piece of bone. In bone, some cases it is acute, but more generally chronic. To Sir B. Brodie’s paper published in 1846, the profession is indebted for the best account of the chronic affection. Bone is liable to an acute as well as chronic abscess. In the acute some necrosis is generally associated with it; but in the chronic, such an association is rare. Not long ago, I treated a boy, mt. 17, who, after intense pain in the Example of head of his tibia for three days, had local swelling and severe constitu- acute tional disturbance, that had been regarded as due to rheuma- abscess of tism. At the end of a month when I saw him, I made a free incision )one' down to the bone to relieve pain, and give vent to any pus that might have found its way externally. A week later pus appeared evi- I dently from the bone, for a probe could be passed through the wound ■ into a cavity. Two weeks later or six weeks from the commencement of the symptoms, I enlarged my opeuing, and through the aperture I in the head of the bone from which the pus had flowed, I re- moved three pieces of hone, together making one the size of a , nut, which rested in a cavity lined with velvety granulations such as are so characteristic of an abscess. A complete recovery ensued. In another boy, mt. 16, in which severe local and constitutional symp- L , I toms had arisen early, I removed a similar piece of bone from a like in endof' cavity in the end of the radius, and with a similar good result. In both radius.ABSCESS IN BONE. 508 Abscess in head of tibia. Chronic abscess in bones. Situation. Symptoms. cases, acute inflammation of bone had ended in the formation of a local abscess with circumscribed necrosis, and recovery rapidly followed the surgical treatment. A few years ago, a child was brought to me, who had received when asleep an injury to the tibia, from a playfellow having attempted to drive a pin into the hone. Nothing beyond some slight local pain had followed the injury fora few days, when severe pain and swelling appeared, with fever, &c. I cut down upon the part with a view of giving relief, when the point of my knife went with a crackle through a thin layer of hone into a cavity, which gave vent to a teaspoonful or more of pus. Immediate relief followed the operatiou and a good recovery took place. These three cases suffice to illustrate the fact that acute abscess - in hone is met with, and to show its symptoms and treatment. Chronic Abscess. In 1773 William Broomfield, surgeon to St. George’s Hospital, in his ‘ Chirurgical Observations,’ writes:—“Whenever a patient; complains of a dull, heavy pain, deeply situated in the hone,, possibly consequent to a violent blow received in the part some time before, and though at the time the patient complains of this un- easiness within the bone the integuments shall appear perfectly sound, and the bone itself not in the least injured, we have great reason to suspect an abscessus in the medulla.” In 1824, Sir B. Brodie ampu- tated a limb for incurable pain in the tibia, and in this case which Sir W. Fergusson has described “ as one of the beacon lights of sur- gery never to he forgotten,” “ the lower end of the tibia is § enlarged, and the surface presents marks of great vascularity; the hone in the preparation is divided longitudinally, and just above the articulating surface there is a cavity as large as a small chestnut. This cavity was filled with dark-- coloured pus. The inner surface oft it is smooth. The hone immediately, surrounding it is harder that natural.” In these two extracts, written at am interval of fifty years, are embodied; the clinical and pathological facts con-- nected with this subject which are now recognised by surgeons. This chronic abscess is generally met; with in the articular ends of hones, that is, in their cancellous tissue, more particularly iu the two ends of the tibia. I have, however, seen it in the condyle of the femur and the humerus, and in the shafts of the ulna, radius, and tibia. It may also occur in any, hone. In Fig. 576 the cavity of such an abscess is illustrated, and in Fig. 559 is seen its opening into the joint. The history of these cases is generally obscure, an injury at times being its assigned cause. The most character- istic symptoms are a fixed, aching.

In more advanced cases, the soft parts over the bone will be oedema- (Edema, tous, and on firm pressure over the painful spot, a sensation of yielding May open will be given to the finger. In still more neglected cases, the abscess intu may make its way into a joint; while under fortunate circumstances it may advance forward and discharge itself externally. Treatment.—“ Abscess in bone may find its way to the surface,” Treatment, but “ the crown of the trephine is often necessary in order to get at the seat of abscess,” said John Hunter, in 1787 (MS. lec.). At the Opening by present day a like treatment is to be advised, as nothing less than the trephine, the opening of the abscess in the bone is of any use, and this is usually done by means of a small trephine. The point to he selected for the operation is the painful spot, which should be marked before the patient is ansestheticised; the soft parts should then be divided by a crucial incision and turned back and the bone itself freely perforated, with the periosteum covering it. When the instrument has opened the abscess, pus will well up at once; the ring of bone raised by the eleva- tor ought then to be taken away; the cavity, which is generally lined with smooth velvety granulations, is rarely very large, and the quantity of pus seldom above a drachm, although sometimes there may be more. After the operation the parts have only to be left alone to heal, recovery being very general. It is not always necessary, however, to trephine a bone, as a less Pnnciure severe operation is at times all that is required, and that is, its simple wit1' drill, puncture by means of a drill; when the seat of the abscess is not very accurately defined the drill is probably the better instrument to use. In a striking case, I had in the spring of 1870,1 carried out this Cases, operation and punctured the head of the tiba of a man who had all the external evidence of local ostitis and suppuration, such as pain, bone expansion, &c. I cut down upon the painful expanded part, and made two punctures with a drill, one of which clearly went into a cavity in the bone, as evinced by the sudden loss of resistance. No pus, however, was seen to well up in the wound at the time, though soon after the operation, a free discharge took place. The operation was followed by complete relief from all pain, and in a month, the man left Guy’s quite restored, and three months later he remained so. More recently, I arrested disease in the femur of a boy, act. 18, by trephining the trochanter major and puncturing the bone with a drill through the opening. This operation of drilling the hone seems to be good either for Value of supposed suppuration or chronic ostitis. It is less formidable than billing, trephining, and may he done in cases where the latter is inapplicable or not to be entertained; indeed, the two means may be employed together when the trephine has failed to open the abscess. Holmes’s suggestion is good, viz. to pierce the walls of the trephine-hole in several directions with a sharp-pointed instrument, in order to remove the bone freely with a chisel, if a drop of pus follow any of these punctures.CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE BONES. 510 Chronic Periostitis and Endostitis. periostitis. ,. Chronic periostitis and ostitis are very common affections, more par- ticularly involving the shafts of the long bones. The ostitis is prob- ably the more common of the two, pure periostitis, unless from syphilis or injury being comparatively rare. These affections may be modified by syphilis, scrofula, or rheumatism, and may originate from some local cause or injury, but in all, their course is the same; the dis- eff™ional 6aSe Varying only in tlle rapidity of its progress, extent of its influence, and results. In one case, complete recovery may take place, the effu- Sclerous. sion being re-absorbed ; in another, the effusion may become organized as a superficial node or bony outgrowth (Fig. 577), or, as an enlarged, elongated area of dense bone (575).

A s regards suppuration. puration may occur, giving rise to a chronic periosteal or endosteal abscess; in a large proportion of instances the bone dies wholly or in part, and thus gives rise to necrosis; whilst in some few, the bone, either upon its surface or interior undergoes a chronic disintegrating process known as caries. The symptoms of chronic periostitis and ostitis (endostitis) are in their nature very similar to, though less severe than those of the acute, the most constant being a dull aching pain in the part of a persistent kind, aggravated at intervals, and on hanging down the limb; the pain being almost always worse at night, more particularly in syphilitic affections. The constitutional symptoms vary according to the seve- rity of the local condition, febrile disturbance, and intensity of local action running hand in hand. In periostitis, the pain is generally local and attended with swelling at an early period of the affection, indeed, within a few days of its onset. In endostitis, the pain is generally more diffused through the whole bone, and will continue for weeks or months without any external evidence of enlargement, being too often regarded as “ rheumatic” or “ growing pains.” In periostitis, tenderness on manipulation is an early and constant symptom. In endostitis, the bone may be manipulated with gentleness without exciting pain; firm pressure, however, almost always causes suffering. In periostitis, the enlargement generally shows itself as a bossy or undulatory swelling on the surface of the bone, with one, two, or more nodes, upon the bone; syphilitic periostitis is generally multiple and undulatory, traumatic and other forms of nodes usually single. In endostitis, the enlargement appears as a general expansion of the bone in all directions; in rare cases as a distinct elongation. In periostitis, when suppuration is about to takeINFLAMMATION OF THE BONES. 511 place, external evidence will appear in the form of increased swelling and tenderness, while redness of the skin, oedema of the tissues cover- ing in the node, and fluctuation will be present. In endostitis, ter- minating in abscess, there will he a great aggravation of local pain with constitutional disturbance, and often rigors; and, when oedema of the soft parts over the bone and external evidence of inflammation appear, the abscess is making its way externally through the periosteum {vide Abscess in Bone). When periostitis causes necrosis, it is only of the shell of hone beneath the inflamed node (peripheral necrosis); the dead bone under these circumstances is exposed, and if covered it is by soft parts alone, and not by new bone (Fig. 569). When endostitis causes necrosis, it is usually of a greater or less mass occupying the centre of the hone (central necrosis), although sometimes the whole shaft or articular extremity of the bone dies. The dead hone or sequestrum is always more or less completely surrounded by new hone—a new periosteal formation (Fig. 571). When this new casing is incomplete, it is a fair proof that the periosteum has been involved (Fig. 573). In necrosis of a long bone the result of periostitis and endostitis by extension, the hope of a new bone being formed is forlorn, as the peri- osteum—the chief bone-forming membrane—has been destroyed; while in the necrosis of endostitis, there is every hope of a complete restora- tion of the bone through its periosteal covering taking place, on the removal of the dead portion or sequestrum. In the necrosis of the skull which is always periosteal, no new bone is formed, as the periosteum is destroyed. When following an injury to the skull it is preceded by “ the puffy tumour of Pott.” In syphilis it follows a suppurating node. In a rare, if not unique preparation (Guy’s Museum) of necrosis after amputation, taken from a patient of my owrn, the end of the divided femur died, and, at a later period, the periosteal sheath of new bone that formed around it also died, one sequestrum being found within the other on their withdrawal from the stump. Tbeathent.—In chronic periostitis when suppuration does not take place, fomentations, with the elevation of the limb, sedatives to allay pain, and the internal use of the iodide or bromide of potassium, with or without tonics, according to the special requirements of the patient, are the most efficient meaus. In still more chronic cases, the use of a blister, or the repeated application of the compound tincture of iodine, is of value. If rheumatism seem to influence the morbid action, colchicum has a beneficial tendency. When nocturnal pain is great, besides the internal administration of opium or other sedatives, the external application of belladonna certainly gives relief. When pain is severe and unrelieved by such treatment, a subcutaneous section of the periosteum with a tenotomy knife is advisable. When suppura- tion threatens, the warmth of a poultice or hot fomentation with or without the application of leeches may sometimes arrest it; a blister at times also seems to check its progress. When pus has formed it is wise as a rule to let it out, but the surgeon should be in no hurry to do this unless the pain is great and the abscess has a disposition to spread, as pus may be re-absorbed, and opening a periosteal abscess renders hone exfoliation more probable.

Holmes’s description, any effect, and the same means that have been recommended for periostitis may be tried in this. In a general way, however, they'do little more than give relief and have but slight effect on the pro- gress of the disease, it being far too common for a bone in a state of chronic inflammation to become necrosed. When treated early, how- ever, success is not unfrequent. When the disease is steadily progress- ing and remedies appear to have no influence on its progress, the operation of drilling the bone in one or more points according to the extent of the disease, is an operation to be recommended; when this fails, that of trephining may be employed, for if taking away a piece of bone or drilling it does not arrest the disease, which it undoubtedly often does, it at any rate gives relief to local pain. Pain in endostitis or periostitis is due to tension caused by pent-up inflam- matory effusion, whether fibrinous, purulent, or serous, and relief can only be afforded by its removal. When a new growth, cystic or other- wise occupies the centre of a bone, a like pain is however experienced. Necrosis means the death of bone, the result of periostitis or endostitis, and it may be of the shell or compact tissue, of the inside or cancellous tissue, or of both combined. It may occur idiopathically without known cause, or as the result of fever, injury from sprain, concussion, contusion, fracture, or gunshot wound. As a consequence of acute inflammation, bone may die rapidly. I have already related a case in which local necrosis of the articular extremity of the tibia took place in six weeks, and it is well known that phalanges necrose and exfoliate in five or six; in fact, in acute necrosis, a month or six weeks is full time for bone to die and be thrown off. In the necrosis of the lower jaw from phosphorus, the same truth is exemplified. When a bone dies from inflammation, it does so usually from the acute form ; the chronic action being shown in the process of exfoliation, i. e. in the separation of the dead from the living bone; for in this process, a considerable time is often expended, no definite period having been hitherto recog- nised, as its rapidity differs in every case. The process of exfoliation is a very beautiful one and is the same in bone as in the soft parts, only slower. “ When a portion of bone is to die,” writes Holmes in an admirable article in his ‘ System,’ vol. iii, “ the first phenomena is the cessation of circulation in it. This leaves it hard, white, and sonorous when struck. It does not bleed when exposed or cut into, and is insensible. Occasionally, when the dead bone is exposed to the air, and acted on by the presence of putrid pus, its colour becomes nearly or quite black; large surfaces of hard, black, necrosed bone are sometimes left ex- posed by the sloughing of the skin over the tibia. The dead bone at first retains its connection to tbe bone around, as well as to the peri- osteum or whatever part of the nutrient membrane may belong to it; but the presence of a dead part is never long tolerated by the living tissues, and accordingly the processes which are to eliminate it soon become perceptible in both these structures. The periosteum or me- dullary membrane, as the case may be, separates from the dead bone and becomes inflamed, a quantity of ossific deposit (more or less, ac- cording to circumstances) is poured out between it and the dead bone, and this deposit soon becomes converted into new bone, forming a513 NECROSIS. sheath over the dead portion, by which the latter is enclosed or invagi- mated, as the technical term is. The dead part is now called a sequestrum, a name only properly applied to it when loose and in- vagiuated, though often incorrectly used of any piece of dead bone. While this sheath is being formed from the membrane coating the dead bone, changes are going on in the living bone to which it was attached. When the latter has been previously diseased, i.e. when the necrosis has been of inflammatory origin, the inflamma- tory deposit which surrounds the sequestrum softens, pus is formed, i and a groove of ulceration is produced at the expense of the circle of inflamed hone which forms the margin of the sequestrum. If the surrounding hone has been previously healthy the sequestrum i acts as an irritant upon it, setting up first inflammation and thicken- ing to a variable distance, and then ulceration. Thus a groove is i traced round the sequestrum, and the formation of the groove is accom- i panied by suppuration, ‘the pus containing much earthy matter from the disintegrated tissue, B. B. Cooper stating 2£ per cent, of phosphate of lime.’ The pus formed in the neighbourhood of the dead parts i makes its way to the nearest surface, and in so doing interrupts the formation of the periosteal sheath, leaving sinuses or cloacae, passing through this sheath from the sequestrum to the surface of the body, or sometimes into a neighbouring joint or serous cavity. The presence of such sinuses leading through the shell of bone to hard, smooth, : sonorous bone at the bottom of the cavity is the distinguishing mark of necrosis” (Pig. 572). Where the periosteum has been destroyed, no investing sheath of bone will exist to interfere with the separation and casting off of the seques- i trum (Fig. 573); where it is nearly perfect, the shell of new bone will ' be complete (Fig. 571). Under these circumstances, the casing thickens and becomes dense. To reach the sequestrum in the thigh, I have cut ' through a bony sheath upwards of an inch in thickness. The subperi- osteal sheath is never seen in necrosis of the skull or in short cancel- lous bones. The whole shaft, or any portion of a long bone may become ne- crosed, the epiphyses often saving the joints (Fig. 573); but as a rule some portion of the shaft remains attached to one or other of the epi- physes. Occasionally the epiphyses themselves are the seat of necrosis. In the tarsal bones during infant life, the ossific centre of the bones may die and exfoliate. There is also good reason to believe that necrosis of the shaft of a bone often originates after a sprain or injury, from inflammation in the epiphysial cartilage connecting it with the | epiphysis. The amount of thickening around the sequestrum depends much upon Thickening the extent of new bone poured out by the periosteum and the duration of bone of the process; its density also turns upon the length of time the around ' sequestrum has been invaginated, and the character of the inflamma- ) tion. The bony shell in its early condition is soft and readily cut, broken down, or peeled off; in its later stages it becomes almost I as hard as ivory, and is most difficult to cut. When the cloacae of the bone case are large and fortunately placed Cloactemav towards the end of the sequestrum, natural efforts may be sufficient of 1)6 lar"e themselves to get rid of the foreign body, the granulations filling the deaTbmie °f cavity gradually pressing upon the dead hone, and mechanically extrud- vol. ii. 33514 NECROSIS.

In this way, large masses of bone are sometimes discharged by natural processes. After amputation, this result is fre- quently seen. Some years ago, I saw with Mr. Cock and Dr. Iliff, of Kennington, a case in which the upper part of the shaft of the humerus which had separated at its upper epiphysis, was gradually pressed out from below through the deltoid muscle and projected outside the acromion process for about an inch; Mr. Cock had only to complete the process which nature had so well commenced, and draw out the bone, which was four inches long (Fig. 578). Fig. 578. Upper half of the shaft of the humerus thrown off at its .junction with the upper epiphysis by natural processes. Prep, i.10460. Every surgeon is familiar with a somewhat similar act in other cases where large pieces of bone, and far more frequently small ones, are sometimes discharged by natural processes; but such successful natural efforts are rare in comparison with the failures, surgical art being demanded, as a rule, to assist in a cure. When the dead bone has been shed, the sequestrum extruded by natural efforts or removed by surgical skill, the bone granulates and thus heals. When this process takes place upon its surface, the steps are very visible, and when the sequestrum has been removed from a cavity, the same process goes on, but with it another acts with equal force, and that is the gradual contraction of the periosteal shell of new boue that surrounds the sequestrum. A bone in this way is reformed and repaired. Treatment. — When the presence of dead bone has been made out, its removal is the only sound practice, since the longer it is left in its cavity, the thicker and denser will become the periosteal bony sheath, consequently the probabilities of a natural cure are lessened, and the difficulties of a surgical operation greatly increased. The seques- trum, however, cannot be taken away until it has been thrown off or loosened from the living tissues; although as soon as this result has been effected, the sooner the operation for its removal is performed the better. To interfere too soon before this process has been completed is sometimes injurious, and always futile; to wait too long is simply to add to the difficulties of the case and to postpone re- covery. Bones that are not loose may, however, often be detached by a good twist with a pair of forceps, or raised by an elevator. When the dead bone is found to be loose by means of a probe, by being made to move in its sheath, there should be no hesitation on the part of the surgeon as to interfering; though when this movement cannot be made out, the same treatment may be j ustifiable, as the sequestrum may be so tightly impacted or shut in by granulations, as to be im- movable though still separated. Under these circumstances, the history of the case and more particularly the duration of the disease will be of great help as a guide, for if many months have passed since the inflammation that killed the bone set in, the probabilities of theNECKOSIS. 515 sequestrum being loose are great, as most sequestra are shed in four, five, to ten months. I have seen a sequestrum in acute disease thrown off in six weeks, and have removed a large portion of the shaft of the tibia three mouths after the first onset of the symptoms; while, on the other hand, the dead bone may be found fixed at a far more distant date than that named. All know that a necrosed phalanx is generally loose and ready for removal at the end of five weeks, and in most cases the surgeon is justified in performing the operation for necrosis (sequestrotomy) within the year. English surgeons, as a rule, are g|,ouij we disposed to wait till the evidence of the sequestrum being quite wait till it loose is clearly marked; whilst many Continental surgeons, and par- ticularly the German, excise diseased bone within three months of the uu;,t' first manifestation of disease, by what is called a sub-periosteal opera- tion, that is, the peeling off of the periosteum, and the resection of the shaft of inflamed, dying, or dead bone. But in doing this, as nature has not yet indicated the limit to the disease, nor separated the dead from the living hone, much good hone must of necessity he often removed with the diseased, or much of the diseased hone left behind, both of which are undesirable objects. In English practice the cure is postponed and the difficulties of the operation are in- creased. In the Continental more may be done by operative inter- ference than is needed or less than is required, the new formation of bone by the periosteum at the same time being necessarily interfered with. The best practice, probably, is to he found between the two, and that Line 0f is, surgical interference about three to six months after the first appear- practice to be ance of symptoms; in acute disease, and in small and narrow bones ®d°pted- early, but in chronic disease, and in large and thick bones late inter- ference. The Operation of Sequestrotomy. There is no operation in surgery more satisfactory than this, as it is Sequcs- usually unattended with clanger and followed by complete success. In trotom.v- many cases it is simple, while in others it is complicated, the in- genuity of the surgeon being often taxed to devise means to carry out the object in view, viz. the removal of the sequestrum. Taking as a type of the affectiou, the tibia in which the whole shaft or diaphysis is the seat of mischief, many cloacae, or fistulas, leading down to the dead hone through the periosteal bony case will probably he present, as is shown in Fig. 572; and with a probe introduced through an open* Description ing at one end and a second at the other, the surgeon may make his of operation, incision between the two down to the hone—that is, down to the new case of hone that envelopes the old—and having done this he may peel hack the periosteum with a raspatory or periosteal retractor, cut through the new hone that prevents the dead from being seized, by means of forceps or chisel, and thus expose the necrosed shaft. The use of dead piece may then be seized by a pair of sequestrum forceps, and, cutting where practicable, withdrawn. Should it be too long to extract through f°rceps. the wound, or should the opening in the bony case correspond to Its centre, the sequestrum may he divided with a pair of cutting forceps, and its two halves separately removed. At times a good elevator is of use to raise the sequestrum from its bed, or to prise it from its attachment. Occasionally a good deal of the new casing of hone requires removalNECROSIS. 516 Fig. 579. Arrest of growth after removal of dead bone. Instruments used in sequestrotomy. before the surgeon can get at the dead portion; and in the femur Iig. 580. where the whole shaft is necrosed, the upper part being larger than the lower, it may be necessary to chisel off or remove nearly the whole surface of the new shell of bone to admit of the removal of the sequestrum, it being impossible to withdraw through the lower orifice a piece of hone of larger diameter. In one case, the simple enlargement of one of the cloacae may be sufficient to enable the sui'geon to seize and remove the bone; while in another, it is necessary to lay two or more cloacae into one. The operation should be done with as little interference with the soft parts and bony sheath as possible. The object having been obtained, the parts have only to be kept clean, raised, and left alone to fill up and heal, when a good recovery wall generally follow. The instruments employed for sequestrotomy are illustrated in Fig. 579. In all cases, Esmarch’s elastic tourniquet should be em- ployed to prevent haemorrhage. When the whole shaft of a bone has been removed in early life, some shortening of the new Arrest of growth bone or arrest of growth may be looked for, and in of tibia after re- the case (Fig. 580) such a result took place. ™mft fourteen Tlle drawing was taken from a young woman, set. 25,. years before. from whom, fourteen years before, I removed theNECROSIS. 517 whole shaft of the tibia. The bowing of the limb was due to the bending of the fibula, which had grown naturally and bent to adapt itself to the shortened tibia. When the sequestrum cannot be raised from its bed, it had better be " hen left alone, the opening made not being lost, as through it the ^eesdtnim sequestrum may subsequently be taken away or expelled naturally. Dead bone, the result of periosteal disease, that is not covered in by new bone, readily exfoliates, and rarely requires more than its simple removal by forceps, the soft parts covering it being divided; in this way, large portions of the skull may be removed. 1 have taken away nearly half the frontal bone in a child, and also in an adult, after syphilitic periostitis, large portions of all the cranial bones forming the vault. In one case, large portions of the parietal, occipital, and frontal bones were removed. When after necrosis of a bone the sequestrum presses upon an Necrosis may artery, fatal haemorrhage may ensue. Thus, Poland has recorded u]“es,catioil of (‘Guy’s Hosp. Rep.’) three cases where such a result took place in artery> necrosis of the femur, the popliteal artery in each having been wounded. Holmes has also recorded a case where a fatal haemorrhage from the Necrosis^ lingual artery followed disease of the jaw, and from the aorta in caries m°eratiou of of the spine. A preparation in the Guy’s Museum (1243s0) also shows arteries, a piece of necrosed tibia that perforated the anterior tibial artery and set up haemorrhage, necessitating the application of a ligature to the femoral artery. When necrosis occurs in a joint, prof use suppuration and disorganiz- Necrosis in a ation must ensue. Where this does not prove fatal and repair goes on, recovery may be prevented by the presence of diseased bone; and when this can be detected its removal is the best practice. I have done this in the knee in three cases, and in the hip, ankle, shoulder, and elbow-joints with good result, having in all removed large pieces of dead bone through a sufficiently large incision. (‘ Lancet,’ Feb. 6, 1875.) Such cases as these must be looked upon as cases of necrosis, the joint having lost its special features by previous disease. Necrosis of the carpal and tarsal bones is a common affection, for Necrosis these bones die like the flat bones, no new sheath of bone preventing of carpal and their exfoliation or removal. They may be treated freely, such inei- ,arsal tones, sions being made as will allow of their removal. The os calcis is the Frc,e incision bone most commonly affected, and 1 have removed a large portion1111 remo'a1, of it on many occasions with complete success. The epiphysis of the heel is not rarely affected. The scaphoid is sometimes involved, even at a very early period. The cuneiform and cuboid, separately or together, are also found diseased. Not long ago, I removed from a boy’s foot by two incisions, the whole row of these bones, and an ex- cellent foot wars left—so good, indeed, that it was difficult to believe that so much bone had been taken away (Fig. 548). The same may be said of the carpal bones. Indeed, in these cases true conservative surgery is of great value. The removal of dead bone, however ex- tensive, is a very safe operation, and followed by results which are often startling by their success. There is no limit to the removal of necrosed bone, wherever found, nor to the amount of natural repair. To amputate a limb, foot, or hand, for necrosed bone until the surgeon has proved that the removal of the diseased part is impossible518 CARIES OF THE BONES. On caries. Definition. Periosteal caries. Articular caries. Syphilitic caries. f Endosteal caries. or the simple removal proved unsuccessful, is scarcely a justifiable pro- ceeding. To gouge away bone that is inflamed and not dead, or to excise inflamed bones that nmy undergo repair, is a proceeding which is practically bad and scientifically unreasonable; for all bone that is not dead is reparable, and to interfere with it mechanically is bad surgery. The great success of the operation for necrosis (sequestrotomy) is unquestionably due to the introduction of anesthetics. Prior to their introduction the operation was difficult and dangerous, in- deed, it was rarely performed, amputation having been too often substituted. Caries. No word in surgery has been used with greater carelessness and with a greater variety of meanings than caries, nor is there one that conveys now a less definite idea. In this section it will be applied to an unhealthy inflammation of' bone, chiefly of cancellous bone. When superficial, it is often associated with ulcerative or mole- cular death, when deeply placed or central, with necrosis or suppura- tion, and may or may not be associated with syphilis or struma. It is pathologically remediable and reparable, and whenever found is mixed up with reparative processes. In patients of feeble power and some constitutional cachexia, or where the disease is very extensive, it may, however, clinically be incurable, and thus require surgical interference. Nevertheless, in its nature it is inflammatory, and should be looked upon as a curable affection, depending more upon constitutional than local causes. In this respect differing from necrosis. A bone is said to be carious on its surface when being exposed it presents an irregular and worm-eaten appearance, and is suppurating, and the sore throws off a serous, more or less offensive, purulent discharge, -which contains excess of phosphate of lime, mixed with small fragments of bone tissue. This affection is generally associated with an ulcer or open sore of the skin over the parts, and more or less thickening of the periosteum and bone around and beneath the diseased portion. It is always vascular, and readily bleeds on being touched. It is occasionally painful. At times the bone is soft and yields to the pressure of the probe; in other cases it is hard. When it attacks the articular surface of a bone it often forms pits with sharp well-defined edges, and under these circumstances has been looked upon as scrofulous, but with what amount of truth it is difficult to say. When it is associated with syphilis it follows the suppuration of a node. At times it is complicated with the tubercular thickening of the surface of the bone itself, or with what Paget has described as annular ulcers, in which a spot of ulcera- tion is seen which goes on to form a circular trench round a worm- eaten surface. This trench increases in width- and depth, and at last loosens a sequestrum, which separates and leaves a circular de- pression. In bones of the skull this ulcer may involve one or both tables. This ulcer may subsequently heal, leaving a permanent depression. “ Caries,” in fact, is inflammation and ulceration of bone, “ necrosis ” is its death en masse, A bone carious in its interior is vascular, although softened some- times almost to rottenness, and easily breaks down ; it discharges oftenCARIES OF THE BONES. 519 a thin, sanguineous, fetid, semi-purulent fluid, which contains frag- ments and elements of bone; abscesses which generally communicate externally through the soft parts often co-exist in and about the bone, and are occasionally combined with necrosis. In the spine, where it is Characters the more commonly met with, it is often unassociated with any ““g p.™|ress external suppuration or discharge, though the bone with the inter- vertebral substance softens down and undergoes extensive molecular death; much loss of bone taking place, the particles being appa- rently reabsorbed and carried away, and complete recovery follow- ing without any external discharge. Around the inflamed or carious bone the cancellous tissue is generally infiltrated with more or less organizable inflammatory lymph, the character of which depends much upon the character of the inflammation. In feeble and strumous sub- jects, the fluid will be of a serous, oily, and non-plastic kind (‘ Black on Tuberculous Bone/ Edin., 1859), the cancellous bone becoming more cellular and lighter. In more healthy types, the effusion will be plastic and organizable, the bone becoming more compact. In one case no consolidation of the surrounding bone will be present, while in another, condensation of the bone to a greater or less extent will be found. Under all circumstances the nature of the inflammatory action turns much upon the constitutional power of the patient; the disease tending in strumous and feeble subjects to widen but not to repair, while in more healthy subjects it inclines to a local action and recovery. In rare examples, genuine tubercle may co-exist with the inflam- mation. Treatment.—Looking upon caries as an inflammatory affection and Treatment of consequently as curable, it is to be treated on somewhat similar prin- caries, ciples to inflammation of other parts. When the general powers of the patient are feeble, they ought to be stimulated by tonic medicine and regimen; local pain to be soothed and torpid action stimulated, but all mechanical and surgical interference should be avoided, except for the removal of dead bone. In superficial or periosteal caries In superficial or ulceration, when rest, elevation, soothing or possibly stimulating caries, applications with tonics fail to induce a healthy reparative action, local stimulants are sometimes of use, and the application of such mineral acids as the nitric or sulphuric, strong or diluted, has often a beneficial action. Pollock speaks highly of the value of sulphuric acid, at first Pollock’s diluted with equal parts of water and subsequently pure, the acid de- Plau> stroyiug the diseased bone to which it is applied, and setting up a more healthy action in the parts beneath, thus hastening recovery. Boinet advocates the use of iodine, at first diluted and then strong; others recommend phosphoric acid. Dr. Fitzpatrick applies the Vienna paste or potassa cum calce to the surface of the inflamed bone, as well as to its deeper parts after puncturing them. The actual or galvanic cautery has also been employed, and in superficial caries seems to be valuable. In deep-seated or endosteal caries, some speak highly of In deep' operative interference, either by the gouging out of the diseased tissue endosteal or excision of the inflamed or carious bone; but I allude to this treat- caries, ment only to condemn it, since I believe it to be both unnecessary and Surgical injurious. It is unnecessary, as in the majority of cases recovery can interference be secured without it; it is injurious, since gouging, as a rule, adds to lit cess ary.TUMOURS OF BONE. 520 the irritation, and thus tends to spread the disease, and often excites more general inflammation in the bone or endosteum. Excision not Excision of the diseased bone is not an operation that can be highly recom- recommended; yet it may be done, doubtless, with success, as in the mended. tarsus, and many an inflamed or carious os calcis has been successfully excised. Thero is, however, a strong question as to the necessity of the operation. When the bone dies, the necrosed bone may and should be removed, hut in all other conditions, it is reparable under constitu- tional treatment and local applications. Surgeons who interfere sur- gically with carious bones usually prefer excision to any partial opera- tion. Superficial or periosteal caries may be regarded and treated as an indolent ulcer in other parts, the repair being more chronic in bones than in soft tissues, and deep-seated caries or inflammation may be also considered muclfin the same light. When syphilis complicates the case, iodine in full doses, in one of its forms, and as a local application, is of great use, combined with any tonic that may appear to be needed. TUMOURS OF BONE. Tumours of bone. Character. Varieties of tumours. Exostoses. Cranial exostoses. Enostosis. Tumours of hone vary but little in their pathology from tumours of other parts, and whatever differences exist, arise from the peculiarity of the tissue in or around which they grow. Tumours of bone, as of soft parts, partake of the nature of the tissue in which they are developed; thus, a tumour that in a fibrous organ would be more or less fibrous, when originating in or upon a bone is mixed with hone, and a carcino- matous tumour of soft parts becomes a malignant osteoid cancer of a hone. In addition to these, there are special tumours known as the myeloid, and the cartilaginous. Excluding, therefore, enlargements of bone due to inflammation, there are bony outgrowths or exostoses, cartilaginous and myeloid tumours, all being, as a rule, of an innocent nature. There are the osteo-sarcomatous tumours, or fibrous tumours of bone, including those that have a periosteal as well as an osteal origin, the fibrous and osseous elements predominating in various degrees; and, lastly, there are the malignant tumours of bone, whether of the soft or the hard kind, osseous matter being mixed up largely noth both; the disease ac- quiring the name of osteoid cancer when the bony elements pre- dominate. These tumours grow from the periosteum as well as from the hone. Exostoses may grow from almost every hone; from the cranium inside and out, as well as from the hones of the trunk and extremities. Those of the cranium are usually very dense and of ivory-like hardness; indeed they are often called ivory exostoses, and sometimes are so hard that they cannot be removed. They may have broad bases, but at times are'pedunculated, and in singular examples they occur as loose growths; these latter have generally occurred in the frontal sinus and should be described as enostoses. Mr. Hilton has recorded an interesting case (‘ Guy’s Rep.,’ vol. i.), in which such a bony tumour, of twenty-three years’ standing (Fig. 582), fell out of a large cavity in the superior maxillary bone (Fig. 581). The man in 1865, thirty years after the operation, was well, although disfigured by the hole in which the tumour had rested; and in a former page (page 14, vol. ii) I have recorded aTUMOURS OP BONE. 521 case of the same affection and figured it (Figs. 306—7). These bony growths are<more common about the orbit and air-cells of the head than elsewhere. True ivory exostoses of these parts do, however, occur, and at times attain a large size. Birkett has related (‘ Guy’s Rep.,’ 1868) such a case of Dr. V. Bruns’, in which an ivory tumour of seventy-four years’ existence, weighing ten pounds, grew from the occipital bone of a man, set. 80. Exostoses from the jaws, or rather alveoli, are often called “ epulis.” Fig. 581. Fig. 582. Tumour as discharged from cavity in Fig. 581, weight nearly 15 oz., circumference 11 by 9 inches.

Exostoses on the extremities are not uncommon and are apt to Exostoses spring from the point of junction of the shaft with the epiphysis, on the (Virchow considering this as the usual seat), and at the attachment extremities. of muscles. They are mostly outgrowths of bone capped with carti- lage by which they grow (Fig. 583); exostoses, however, of long standing have an osseous shell. They have at times broad bases, Fig. 583. but more frequently narrow pe- duncles. They are often curved l j or crested, assuming odd shapes, and may grow to a large size.

Some exostoses have a periosteal origin, the result of organized inflam- matory products; when they are usually diffused. Fig.584 showsthis well, and was taken from a patient of my father’s, the late Mr. T. E. Bryant. Fig. 584. Periosteal exostosis. Prep. 111!60, Guy’s IIosp. Mus. Ungual exostoses deserve a special notice, since they are even now too often mistaken for what is called an ingrowing toe-nail. They are generally found on the distal phalanx of the great toe (Fig. 56, page 180, vol. i), but Prep. 1287, Guy’s Museum, shows a specimen from the little toe, and I have had under care two cases in which an exostosis grew from the ungual phalanx of the thumb, and one in which it was attached to the index-finger. Liston, in 1825, first drew attention to the nature of these cases. The osteophytes and the outgrowths of osteo-arthritis are not classed amongst the exostoses. Treatment.— When surgical interference is called for, nothing but the removal of these growths can be entertained, their bases being well levelled down to the bone or even scooped out. When, however, they are placed near joints, this practice should be well considered. In a case in which an exostosis projected from the inner condyle of the knee I divided its base subcutaneously with a chisel, and pressed it back into the popliteal space, where it remained without giving trouble. In cranial exostosis, this operation may not only be difficult but im- possible ; still the attempt, wherever it can, should be made, for many successful attempts have ended in procuring the death of the exostosis and its subsequent exfoliation. In such a case, treated by Mr. Cock, where the removal of the whole from the orbit was impossible from its hardness, a part was removed, and what remained subsequently died and sloughed out. Intra-cranial exostoses are rarely made out during life, and are at times associated with epilepsy. The following analysis of 120 cases of exostoses will show the seat of these growths. 45 were tabulated by my colleague, Mr. Birkett, in ‘ Guy’s Reports;’ and the remainder are from my private notes.

Three of the cases tabulated were examples of multiple exostosis; when the radius was affected, it was in common with other bones. Enchondromatous or cartilaginous tumours of bone are most com- Enclion- monly met with in the phalanges and metacarpal bones. They are, droma. however, seen surrounding bones having a periosteal origin, or grow- ing from the bones of the’upper jaw. A remarkable instance of this has been recorded in Chapter XIII, and figured in Fig. 218. It would appear that such cartilaginous tumours are more prone to attack the scapula than any other bones, and I have seen several such cases. Mr. Birkett has recorded and figured a fine specimen in the ‘ Guy’s Reports,’ 1866. The bones of the pelvis are at times the seat of such growths. I Pelvis have the records of a remarkable instance in which the pelvic surface sometimes of the ilium was the seat of the affection, and of another in which a attacl<ed. Fig. 585.

In Pig. 21 the section of such a growth is well illustrated. Cartilaginous tumours are usually of slow growth and painless, with a smooth outline. At times they undergo decay and soften down, dis- charging a brown-coloured serous fluid unlike any other tumour; and under such circumstances are prone to disseminate like cancer. At other times they ossify and turn into bony tumours; the “bulbous exostosis” being often an ossified enchondroma. Treatment.—Where a cartilagi- nous tumour can it should be scooped out of a bone, and in the phalanges and metacarpal bones this practice is usually successful. Ex- treme examples of the disease demand amputation or excision of the affected bone. Enchondromatous tumours are at times recurrent, and in rare ex- amples, return as malignant tumours in other parts of the body. Such growths having a periosteal origin are usually rapid in their increase and diffused. True cartilaginous tumours of bone are usually circum- scribed and often multiple. The bones of the hand are at times much involved. Osteo-sarcoma is a term of broad signification, and usually applied to the fibrous tumour of bone in which fibre-tissue and bone elements pre- dominate in various degrees. Wilks believes “ that they are altogether comparable to the fibrous tumours of soft parts.” They usually have a periosteal origin—periosteal sarcoma—and even in exaggerated ex- amples the shaft of the affected bone may clearly be traced through the growth. The tumour is usually circumscribed with a fibrous capsule, and divided by fibrous or ossitie rays into different portions ; at times the fibrous element predominates, at other the osseous. The disease is usually seen attacking the ends of the shafts of bone and not the epiphyses. All these points are well seen in Fig. 587. Cartilage is often found to be mixed up with the fibrous and osseous elements; and in proportion to the amount of bone matter entering into the formation of the tumour it may be regarded as innocent or other- wise ; bony periosteal growths are rarely cancerous. When fibrous tissue, and more particularly the softer forms, predominate, the tumour is prone to recur at the same spot, or in some other organ, as is the case with cancer. Osteo-chondroma is applied to a tumour involving bone, and made up of cartilage and bony elements in variable degrees, the cartilage taking the place of the fibrous tissue of the osteo-sarcomatous tumour. In one case, bone will predominate, in another, cartilage. The disease is usually Fig. 586. Enchondromatous tumours. From a model in the Guy’s Museum.TUMOURS OF BONE. 525 of slow growth and simple in its nature. In the case of a woman, set. 34, from which Fig. 588 was taken, the disease had existed for three years.

Myeloid tumours of hone are probably innocent, exceptional instances Myeloid being on record in which a return in the part or in internal organs tumours, took place. They usually attack also either the epiphyses or epi- physial ends of the shafts of hones (Fig. 590). I have seen the disease, however, involving the shaft of the radius and upper jaw, and Paget has described it as attacking the breast. It begins commonly in the centre of the bone which it ex- pands, forming a globular shell of bone, the spina ventosa of the older writers(Fig.591). The interior of this shell is made up of fibre-tissue, or, it may be cystic, tlie cavity being di- vided by means of fibrous septa into more or less well-marked cystic divi- sions.The spaces themselves,or loculi, contain the characteristic myeloid material, “an opaque white, inter- mixed with a semi-transparent gela- tinous-looking substance of a cherry- r red colour,” and their substance is from Tlie cystic form.526 TUMOURS OP BONE.

When the tumour encroaches on the joint the cartilage is usually spread out over the tumour, but intact. These tumours were originally mixed up with the cancerous or flbro-plastic of Lebert. They are found likewise in the gums as “ epulis,” and in other parts. In a specimen of myeloid tumour of the upper jaw which I removed from a girl, set. 8, the structure was very dense (‘Guy’s Rep.,' 1873-4-7). Cancers of bone as of other parts show their malignancy in involv- ing the utter destruction of the bone in which they are developed. They may originate in the periosteum or in the bone, but in either case both tissues will be eventually affected. When they originate from the periosteum, the bone may be found in parts running through the mass, Fig. 592. Fracture of the femurfrom muscular action at the seat of a local cancer in a man, set. 28.527 TUMOURS OP BONE. and the cancerous elements surrounding the shaft (Fig. 593), but when the disease has existed for any period, the same cancerous elements will will he found in the shaft itself and destroying it. When the disease Endosteal begins in the bone, it is usually in the medulla by one or more differentform- centres, and these by their increase, expand the bone and utterly destroy it (Fig. 592). The bones under these circumstances are very brittle and apt to break on the slighest force, even by ordinary muscular action, the fracture probably being the first indication of the presence of the can- Spontaneous cerous disease. I have known fracture to occur under these circum- fracture in. stances by a patient turning in bed, crossing a street, or walking down Fig. 593. Periosteal cancer of the tibia. stairs. In the majority of cases of cancer of bone, bone elements have little to do with the disease, though in what is called the true osteoid Fig. 594. I Osteoid cancer of knee-joint. Prep Guy’s IIosp. Mus., 1165s0.TUMOURS OF BONE. 528 Periosteal form. Endosteal form. Epithelial cancer. Subsequent to necrosis. cancer, masses of bone of a condensed kind appear in the medulla, and gradually grow until a large osseous mass of disease is formed. In Fig. 594 this form of disease is well seen, and was taken from a patient of Mr. Aston Key’s, set. 26, in whom masses of hone and cartilaginous tubercles were found in the lungs, pleura, and lymphatic glands after death. The periosteal form of cancer (Fig. 593) grows more rapidly than the endosteal or interstitial, and very quickly assumes a large size; and is not often accompanied by pain; the swelling is rarely globular in its outline, but loses itself both above and below in the surrounding parts; and in the integument covering it large full veins, from ob- struction to the deep veins will likewise be seen. It will possess a semi-elastic feel, and often yield to the touch an unequal sensation as to density. Endosteal cancer is commonly attended with a dull aching pain, due to the expansion of the bone. Its increase is at first slow, but when it has so destroyed the bone as to have reached the periosteum, pain will be lessened, while the increase of the tumour Fig. 595. Cancer attaching necrosed tibia. will be more rapid. This form of cancer is more frequently secondary than primary. Primary cancer of bone or periosteum is more common in children than in adults. Epithelial cancer may attack a bone by the extension of the disease from the soft parts, as seen in cancer of the lips; and skin cancer may Fig. 596. also extend downwards into a bone of an extremity and cause great destruction. At times, a bone that has been the subject of necrosis mayTUMOURS OP BONES. 529 become the seat of cancer, and, within a short time, I had three such cases under care, in two of which the tibia was the seat of the disease, necrosis having existed in both for upwards of twenty years; and in the third, although the femur apparently became necrosed twenty-two years before the man came under my observation, the cancer evidently began in the skin over it, and extended down the sinuses into the bone. Fig. 596 was taken from the limb of this patient during life, Fig. 595 was taken from the limb after amputation at the knee-joint in another case. In a man I treated years ago, the os calcis and the soft parts over it were the seat of the disease, and the bone after amputation was found infiltrated with cancerous epithelial elements; and more recently (1878) I amputated the foot of a woman which had been the seat of cancer for twenty-five years, and of necrosis for ten. The Diagnosis of Tumours of Bone. In most cases an approximation to truth can only be made. A globular tumour situated in the articular end of a bone, and ex- Diagnosis, panding it but not involving the joint, of slow, steady, and often pain- less growth in a young subject or adult, is probably myeloid. A more elongated or ovoid tumour situated in the shaft of a bone, of more rapid growth, with full veins in the soft parts covering it, and a semi-elastic, unequal feel, in a young subject, is probably a periosteal cancer. A firm, fibroids growth, of a somewhat globular form, of gradual increase and unequal surface, fibrous in one spot, bony in another, in an adult, is probably an osteo-sarcoma, while a more indu- rated growth with a botryoidal outline, and a similar clinical history, is probably an osteo-chondroma. Pain, rapid and diffused growth, with unequal density, glandular enlargement, venous obstruction, and wasting, generally indicate cancer. Gradual, painless increase, a defiued contour, globular, botryoidal, or in ridges, with no venous obstruction, glandular enlargement, or disturbance of the general health, usually indicate a benign tumour. The more globular the outline the greater the probability of the growth being myeloid. The older the patient and the more botryoidal the growth, the greater the chance of its being enchondromatous. The slower the growth, the more local and divided into septa, the greater the chance of its being osteo-sarcoma. When a tumour is periosteal, by making firm pressure below the tumour, the bone will be made out to be on a lower level than the growth. When the tumour is endosteal and the bone expanded, on making firm pressure below the surface of the bone, the bone will be felt to rise gradually from the unaffected part over the surface of the growth so as to form a shell for it. Treatment.—A tumour of bone can only be effectually treated by Treatment, excision, and when it involves the articular end of the bone and encroaches upon a joint amputation is too often necessarv. When the whole bone is involved as in a cancer, nothing but amputation can be mt*t o entertained, and it is usually well to amputate high above the disease, in cancer.°n If the tumour is placed in the head of the tibia, an amputation at the knee-joint may be performed, or, where this is inexpedient, just above the condyles. If the condyles of the femur are the seat of the disease the amputation should be at the centre of the shaft, it bein«- justifiable to amputate at the hip-joint only when the disease’is too ex- vol. ii. 34530 TUMOURS OP RONES.

Cysts in bone. tensive to allow of an amputation through the bone, for the hip-joint operation is most fatal and should be performed only when any less severe measure is impossible. In an evident cancer of the lower half of the femur, where amputation is to be performed, it had better be at the hip-joint, though in doubtful cases, the limb may be removedjust above the growth. In the upper extremity, however, where amputation at any of the joints is, as a rule, successful, it is wise in cancerous disease to remove the whole of the affected bone and amputate at the articu- lation above. In periosteal cancers the whole bone should always be removed. Amputation for myeloid and simple tumours are generally successful; and a young woman for whom I amputated the thigh for myeloid disease, in 1861, was still well seventeen years after the operation. If a tumour involve the shaft of a bone, or the extremity of its dia- physis, but not the epiphysis, and the growth appears to be local and probably simple, an attempt should first be made to deal with it locally, to scoop or to turn it out, the more severe measure of excision or amputation being alone bad recourse to should the miuor fail. In the case of the enchondromatous and fibrous tumours of bone, the minor measure is usually successful. In fact, in the treatment of tumours of bone, when the disease can be removed without making any great sacrifice of other parts, the attempt should be made. Amputation as a primary measure should be reserved for clearly cancerous cases or diffused growths, or for such as involve the articular ends of the bones, and, consequently, the joint. Some interesting cases illustrating the advan- tage of excising portions of the long bones when the seat of myeloid . and other tumours, have been recorded by Messrs. Lucas and Morris,. in the tenth vol. of the ‘ Clinical Society’s Transactions.’ Pulsatile tumours of bone are cancerous, as a rule, though they may be aneurismal. Cancerous tumours of the skull are frequently pulsatile, and in one well-marked case I had under care some time ago, in which the frontal bone was the seat of the disease, this pulsatile condition was its early symptom, the swelling being comparatively unnoticed. All pulsatile bone tumours have an interstitial origin and expand the bone, the new growth receiving its impulse from the large arteries that supply it. Gray (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xxxix) has recorded an example of pulsating myeloid. True cases of osteo- aneurism are rare. Mr. Bickersteth, of Liverpool, has recorded such a case, aud I had the pleasure of examining it carefully with Mr. W. Adams, and reporting upon it to the Pathological Society, vol. xix. It was, undoubtedly, a genuine case of this disease involving the tibia. Mr. Mapother (‘ Dublin Med.-Trans.,’ 1863) has recorded another. These cases are made up of expanded bone from aneurismal dilatation of the vessels of the bone. Treatment.—Pulsatile cancerous tumours of bone, like the non- pulsatile, ought to be treated by amputation; true osteo-aneurisms, of a limited size, when they can be made out, by local extirpation or by destroying them by means of the actual or galvanic cautery, aud when very extensive, by amputation. Dr. Mapother cured his by the actual cautery, and Mr. Bickersteth by amputation. Cysts in bone are occasionally met with, and may be serous, san- guineous, or hydatid. The two former are most commonly met with531 HYPERTROPHY AND ATROPHY OP BONE. in the jaws, and in Chapter XIII, attention has been directed to them. Whether they ever occur in the long bones is an open question, though in 18701 trephined the enormously enlarged and expanded shaft of the tibia of a man, ait. 30, for gradually progressive disease of fifteen years’ standing; the bone having been the seat of a fixed pain in its centre. I did so under the impression that the case was one of abscess, but hav- ing perforated a dense shell of bone, an inch thick, I came upon a cavity the size of an egg, which contained no pus though it was lined with the soft velvety material usually met with in abscess, and what escaped from it was not to be distinguished from the blood that flowed during the operation. The operation was quite successful, and a rapid cure ensued. I believe this case to have been one of cyst in the bone. Hydatids are found in bone, and in Guy’s Museum there is the head of a tibia containing a cyst or echinococcus which holds many smaller cysts within it; also another specimen illustrating the existence of hydatids in the vertebrae. In 1869 I treated with Dr. Freund, a case in which a large hydatid escaped from the expanded condyle of the humerus after a puncture in front of the joint. The hydatid had clearly made its way from the bone into the elbow-joint, and through this externally; a good recovery with a stiff joint ensued. Hypertrophy and atrophy of bone are pathological realities, although during life it may be a difficult if not an impossible task to recognise such conditions. Hypertrophies and chronic inflammatory changes are consequently often mistaken the one for the other, although in the former the enlargement is gradual and painless, and, in the latter associated with local pain and other evidence of inflammation. In some cases the bone is enlarged and its cancellous structure expanded (porous hyperostosis); in another it is enlarged, but at the same time more dense (sclerotic hyperostosis). These changes are best seen in the calvaria (Fig. 597). In Prep 106835 in Guy’s Museum, the bone is at least double its normal thickness. In rare cases, the hypertrophy is clearly due to increase of function, as shown in another preparation in Guy’s Museum, 100015, taken from a man who was a paralytic, and who had used his arms for progression, here the bones of the upper extre- mity are larger than those of the lower. In the majo- rity of cases, however, the hypertrophy is inflammatory, and even in the case which Mr. P. Hewett mentioned in his well-kuown ‘ College Lectures,’ where the man’s skull increased so impercep- tibly year by year as to be only recognised by the gra- dual increase in the size of his hat, the disease was traced to an injury. This aflection is pathologically interesting, though surgically nothin^ can be done for it. = I'iq. 597. Hypertrophy and atrophy of the hone, prep, in Guy’s Museum. Hydatids.

Mollities ossium. Durham’s views. Atrophy Is most commonly mot with in the shafts of bones that have not been used for many years, as in paralytic subjects and persons who have been the subjects of joint disease; in the bones of the aged, and in those that have been injured. The botie may become a mere shell, its cancellous tissue being expanded, and its cells filled with a fatty matter. When atrophy follows injury, Curling’s suggestion (‘Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xx) that the causes may be found in injury to the medul- lary artery is probably right. This probably happened in the case of a man who came to me with an ununited fracture of the humerus, in whom I found the bone on exposing its ends for operation to be a mere shell and not half its normal thickness. It, however, cannot be the only explanation, as Norris has recorded (‘ American Journ. of Med. Sci.,’ 1842) a remarkable case, in which after a double fracture of the humerus about its centre, the whole bone disappeared, the forearm subsequently swinging as a thong, while the arm became shortened six inches ; the bone disappeared “ by the gradual action of the absorbents.” In these cases, spontaneous fracture or fracture from slight muscular action is very prone to occur. f These cases of hypertrophy or atrophy must not be confused with the elongation of the shaft of a bone which is due to inflamma- tion, or to the shortening of a bone from arrest of its growth follow- ing disease or the removal of the shaft, or to some injury to the epiphysial cartilage that connects the shaft with the epiphysis; for it cannot be too strongly impressed upon the student’s mind that any disease or injury which interferes in any way with the nutrition of the epiphysial cartilage through which the long bones mainly grow, will be followed by arrest of the bone’s growth, and consequently, by the shorten- ing of the limb; that is, when the disease or accident occurs in early life during the period of growth, I have before me the notes of several cases where this result ensued. In one in adult life, the tibia was an inch shorter than its fellow after the removal of a necrosed shaft in childhood (vide Tig. 580); in another, nearly the same amount of shortening followed an injury to the superior epiphysial line of the tibia; and in a third, the same result followed after a displacement of the lower epiphysis. In all these cases, the fibula was curved outwards, the shaft of the bone bent, and the outer malleolus much lower than the inner, the bone having grown as the others. In one case, the head of the fibula was partially displaced outwards. Mollities ossium, or osteo-malacia is a rare affection, and its cause wrapped in obscurity. It is found in men in about one case iu ten of the affection, and in women is usually discovered during, even if it does not originate in, pregnancy. It. chiefly attacks subjects wbo, from some cause or other, have been subjected to prolonged depres- sing influences, more particularly upon the nervous system. My colleague, Mr. Durham, in an able paper on the subject (‘Guy’s Rep.,’ 1864), writes “ that mollities ossium is to be regarded as a particu- -1 lar expression, as it were, of a general morbid condition of the system, rather than as a special disease of the bones themselves,” and I believe there can be little doubt as to the soundness of the opinion. It should never be confounded with rickets, or with the fragility of the bones met with in the aged or demented.533 MOLLITIES OSSIUM. “The first symptom of the disease,” writes Durham, “ is pain, more Symptoms, or less peculiar in character, always deep-seated, and greatly increased by pressure or motion; sometimes coming on suddenly and with extreme severity, sometimes commencing vaguely and insidiously, and gradually becoming almost insupportable; sometimes wandering, at other times fixed for a period to some particular spot, and subsequently spreading to other parts; sometimes intermitting, at other times unceasing. Ill the majority of cases the pain appears to have been first felt in the lower half of the spine, the pelvis, and loins; but in some it commenced in the feet, knees, or other parts of the lower extremities; the pains are often looked upon as rheumatic. Associated with the pain there has always been noticed, on the part of the patient, at a very early period of the malady', a feeling of general lassitude and disinclination to do anything. This feeling has increased more or less uniformly until it has ended in actual inability to make any exertion whatever, and with the early local changes are associated an uncertain, feeble gait, and con- tinual fear of falling.” Symptoms that are more or less directly associated with the softening and absorption of the bones are the next to appear, such as diminution of stature, deformity of the spine or pelvis, some curvature or frac- ture of one or other of the long bones, and, as time progresses, these indications multiply,flexibility, conjoined with fragility, being the dis- tinguishing character of the bones in this disease. The urine almost always contains a considerable excess of lime Urine, salts. The disease is rarely attended with any general or local symptoms of inflammation. The changes observed in the bones are Bone carefully described by Durham. Increased vascularity appears to be an Ganges, early symptom, the large grooves seen in the cranial bones being very striking; next, the bony matter is seen to be more opaque and less uniform than natural; sometimes it is irregularly granular, “ as if some disunion must have taken place between the component elements of the bony matter.” The lamination of the hones next becomes less distinct; the laminm Fig. 698.

Chemical changes in the bone. Prognosis and treatment. Rickets. Symptoms. corpuscles become wider, although not with certainty more numerous. At a later date the earthy matter becomes absorbed; the Haversian canals become surrounded by a transparent ring of animal matter; which rings then become disintegrated and absorbed. By this process the Haversian system becomes destroyed, the bone assuming a liollowed-out, porous, or somewhat sponge-like appearance: The contrast between the healthy and diseased bone is well seen in Figs. 598, 598a. The same changes occur in the cancellated as in the compact tissue. In the more advanced stage, the bone disintegrates rapidly; debris of tissue, such as the remains of blood-vessels, shreds of membrane, fat- and oil-globules, with “ marrow-cells,” fill up the large spaces. Chemically, the inorganic constituents are greatly diminished and chemical disunion and physical disunion co-exist, the earthy matter being more readily dissolved out of the diseased than out of normal bone. In healthy bone, “writes Durham,” the constituents are combined; in diseased bone they seem rather to be mixed. The animal constituents are likewise more fatty and less nitrogenized than in normal bone, the fat is more free, In the mineral constituents the proportion of the car- bonate of lime to the phosphate is much diminished. The prognosis in these cases is always bad, although the possibility of a cure should not be doubted. Trousseau relates cases in which a good result was obtained under the combined influence of rest, warmth, good food, and cod-liver oil; the deformity, of course, remaining. Lime salts ought not to be given in these cases, as they cannot be retained, and to give them, adds Durham, is only to throw additional work upon the excreting organs. Eickets is an affection of early childhood, and, by Sir W. Jenner, is said to be the commonest of the diathetic affections among the London poor. It is, however, found in the families of the higher classes, and it is essentially due to some mal-nutrition of the body, connected probably with bad feeding and the use of farinaceous in lieu of animal food, the bones during their period of growth expanding at their epiphysial ends and bending in their shafts, and being very prone to incomplete or green-stick fracture. “ Displacement and obliquity of the epiphyses may ensue from softness and flexibility of the layer of bone uniting it to the diaphysis, as is seen more especially in the ribs; but a slighter degree of epiphysial obliquity is noticed in many of the joints of the long bones, such as the knee or ankle ; the weight of the body is thus thrown unequally, so that one set of ligaments has to bear more trac- tion than another. These ligaments then yield, and the joints become loose, so that rachitic knock-knee (genu valgum) or bow legs (genu varum) is formed.” “ From sustaining the weight of the body the femur bends forwards, the tibia usually forwards and either inwards or outwards, the greatest amount of yielding being where the bone is thinnest and weakest. In many cases we find the os femoris bent forwards, with anterior and outward curvature of the tibia, knock-knee and flat-foot being co-existent in the same individual. Just so far as the rachitic condition extends so may we look for abnormities of form; thus, the pelvic may acquire some of those well-known contractions of its outlet which are matters of such grievous moment to women at the period of parturition,” the pelvis either retaining in adult life the small size and imperfectRICKETS. 535 development of infancy, or becoming narrowed as to its cavity in one or other of its diameters. The chest also undergoes allied changes, aud Mr. Shaw has well pointed out (‘ Holmes’s System,’ vol. iv) how “pigeon breast” is one of the effects of the disease; atmospheric pressure bending in the bones that have lost their elasticity and become softened, and causing a projec- tion of the sternum and lateral flattening of the chest. In the spine, a general curving of the whole column is the more Lordosis, usual deformity ; “ lordosis,” or anterior projection of the lumbar ver- tebrae, as a compensating curve, being found when pelvic obliquity is present. In all cases of rickets, Humphry has shown (‘Med.-Chir. Trans,’ 1862), that deficiency of growth co-exists with deformity, the lower limbs more than the upper indicating this in their proximal segment. In severe cases, all the bones are more or less deformed, the cranium— often large—presenting a quadrilateral aspect, with sutures widely open till a late period of life, or even subsequently re-opening, the bone either remaining thin or subsequently thickening. The periosteum in these cases is also usually thickened both in the flat as well as in the long bones. The general symptoms of rickets are those of debility, muscular and general weakness of the whole frame gradually passing into that of rickets; dentition is retarded, and teeth decay or drop out. Sir W. .Tenner lays great sti'ess upon profuse perspiration of the head during the night, a tendency to kick off bedclothes, fetid stools, and general tenderness of surface, as constant symptoms of the early stage. Tomes and De Morgan inform us that a rickety bone has the struc- Patholosrv. tural arrangement of normal bone without the earthy salts. Jenner (‘ Med. Times,’ 1860), however, describes an enlargement of the lacunae generally, the effusion of a red pulpy substance in the cancellous tissue, and a thickening of the periosteum ; while Gee (‘ St. Bart. Rep.,’ 1868), Dickinson (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1852), and others, have pointed out how' the viscera undergo some “ albuminoid” changes, unlike the waxy or lardaceous disease. Rickets is a curable affection, that is, if taken before it has far ad- Rickets a vanced and it is remarkable to what an extent the deformities are reme- curable diable under natural processes, the curved or bent shafts of bone affection- recovering their natural shape on taking off downward pressure and improving the general powers of the child. In more severe cases where the curvature cannot be remedied, the bone consolidates and becomes strengthened by buttresses of bone along the concavity, and, although the stature may be diminished and the limbs deformed, the general powers of the patient may be restored and a sound recovery take place. Treatment.—The medical treatment of rickets should be conducted Treatment, on reasonable principles—fresh air and abundance of it, simple nutri- tious food such as may suit the conditions of the digestive organs being essentials; milk and beef tea for young children should be mostly relied upon, and meat in moderation for the older. Cod-liver oil, iron and quinine, are also very valuable drugs. The bowels should be carefully- attended to, while all violent purgatives ought to be avoided. The surgical treatment in the early stages is the prevention of defor- contoied!Operative treatment. History and symptoms. 536 OSTEITIS DEFORMANS. mity, and in the later the remedying of it. By way of prevention, the child should be restrained from any prolonged standing or sitting posi- tion, the horizontal posture should be observed as far as possible, some little exercise being allowed and then rest, the two alternating according to the powers of the patient and the necessities of the case. As the general health and powers improve, more liberty may be allowed. In spinal cases these observations are more especially binding, and in them movable couches and spinal chairs are of great service. Where moderate deformity exists, more particularly in the lower extremities, it is often interesting to observe how, by the above means, the bones recover their normal shape, children “ growing out” of their deformity as their health improves, as long as the surgeon takes care it is not increased by neglect. In still worse examples, and where exercise is essential and intermit- tent rest will not be observed, splints and instruments may be bound to the legs. Two long side splints reaching to the ground, carefully bound together and removed at night, are as good as any, or an iron splint with joints at the knee and ankle. Some surgeons prefer an outer splint for knock knee, and an inner one for bow legs. When the curvature of the shafts of the leg hones is very great or acute, Mr. H. Marsh has adopted the plan of forcibly straightening the bones when the patients are under chloroform. He thinks little of the risk of breaking the bone, knowing how rickety bones unite (‘ St. Barth. Rep.,’ for 1870). He believes the plan more adapted for acute than chronic cases. In extreme cases, a wedge of bone may be removed from the shaft. I did this in 1863 on the leg of a child be- tween four and five years of age, and Mr. Little has more recently per- formed the same operation with advantage. It should only be done in extreme instances of deformity, and when no hope of improvement by other means can be entertained. Osteitis Deformans. This name has been given by Sir James Paget to a remarkable dis- ease which he has described in an able paper published in vol. lx of the ‘ Trans, of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society,’ 1877. I have recorded in the ‘ Guy’s Hospital Reports’ for 1877 a good example of it. It begins, writes Paget, in middle age or later, is very slow in progress, may continue for many years without influence on the general health, and gives no other trouble than that which is due to the changes of shape, size, and direction of the diseased bones. Even when the skull is hugely thickened, and all its bones exceedingly altered in structure, the mind remains unaffected. The disease affects most frequently the long bones of the lower extremities and the skull, and is usually symmetrical. The bones en- large and soften, and those bearing weight yield and become unnaturally curved and misshapen, suggesting the proposed name “ osteitis defor- mans.” The spine, whether by yielding to the weight of the overgrown skull or by change in its own structures, may sink and seem to shorten, with greatly increased dorsal and lumbar curves; the pelvis may be- come wide, and the necks of the femora become nearly horizontal. But the limbs, however misshapen, remain strong and fit to support the trunk. (Vide fig. 599.)537 OSTEITIS DEFORMANS. Li its earlier periods, and sometimes through all its course, the disease is attended with pains in the affected bones, pains widely Em. 599. various in severity and variously described as rheumatic, gouty, or neuralgic, not especially nocturnal or periodical. It is unattended with fever. No characteristic conditions of urine or faeces have been found Coimection iu it, nor is it associated with any constitutional disease, unless it be w'th cancer, cancer. Three out of the four cases recorded have ended in con- nection with this affection. The bones examined after death show the consequences of an inflam- Pathological mation affecting, in the skull, the whole thickness; in the long bones changes, chiefly the compact structure of their walls, and not only the walls of their shafts, hut in a very characteristic manner those of their arti- cular surfaces. “ The changes of structure produced in the earliest periods of the disease have not yet been observed ; but it may be believed that they are inflammatory, for the softening is associated with enlargement, with excessive production of imperfectly developed structures, and with increased blood-supply. “ Whether inflammation, in any degree, continues to the last, or whether, after many years of progress, any reparative changes ensue, after the manner of a so-called consecutive hardening, is uncertain.” The disease does not apparently have any shortening influence on Effects oa life, for in Sir J. Paget’s case it had existed for twenty years, and in life, my own the man is now sixty-three, and in robust health, the symptoms having shown themselves about seven years.538 OSTEITIS DEFORMANS. Examples. I also, in May, 1877, saw a second example of this affection in the person of a manned lady, mt. 54, who, although in the enjoy- ment of excellent health, was quite unable to walk without crutches, on account of the weight and weakness of her legs. The disease had been gradually coming on for six years, and the pains in the thighs had given her great trouble. When I saw her she came into my room on crutches and sat down with the arched back so peculiar to this affection, her thigh hones were enormously thickened and bent, the necks of the femora were horizontal, as proved by the test line of the ilio-femoral triangle (Fig. 503), and the knees were far apart from the bowing of the legs. The hones of the upper extremity were also clearly enlarged. I could not make out that the cranial bones were involved. The lady informed me that she was at least an inch shorter this year than she was last, the changes in the necks of the femora would, however, account for this fact. She had had two sisters, one died from cancer of the breast, while the second was an imbecile and had died in an asylum. This case well supports the observations that have been made. Sir J. Paget regards the disease as inflammatory, Dr. Good- hart brings forward another hypothesis. He does not think the term inflammatory can be considered as properly descriptive of this dis- ease, partly because to give “ inflammation ” so wide a meaning as would embrace a general hyperti’ophy of all the hones, as one of its re- sults would be to deprive the term of all significance; and also because it is still less applicable to other diseases allied to the one in question. Dr. Goodhart considers that hyperostosis is essentially a new growth, or as he expresses it, a generalized bone tumour, and adduces in support of this view :—1st. The clinical history of the disease; its co- existence with otherwise good health ; the absence of pain, its intracta- bility under treatment; its frequent association towards its close with some other form of malignant tumour. 2ndly. Its peculiar parrallelism with molluscum fibrosura and a form of elephantiasis, which is a corresponding disease in the subcutaneous or fibro-cellular connective- tissue, to this in hone connective tissue. There is certainly a good deal to be said in favour of this view, and though Sir .Tames Paget does not see his way to adopting it as the more probable, I am, on a review of the whole subject, and unfettered by any partiality for a theory of my own, inclined to think with my colleague. No treatment seems to have the slightest influence on the progress of this affection.ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. 539 CHAPTER XXXIV. ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. “ Gunshot Injuries,” writes Professor Longmore, “ are tlie injuries which result from the action of missiles set in motion by a force which is derived from the ignition of explosive compounds. They compre- hend every kind and degree of hurt which is capable of being pro- duced on the human frame by the mechanical impulse of obtuse bodies.” He informs us, moreover, that in every 100 casualties there Statistics of are 20 killed to 80 wounded, and that of the wounded one third of wounded, the cases are severe and two-thirds slight. The wounds vary much in their character and nature—one caused Their by a rifle ball differing from that by a cannon ball or shell; and the character. direct effect of a missile upon a part differs from that produced indirectly by the scattering of stones or any other hard substance caused by cannon shot or shell. Gunshot contusions of tissues, although apparently trivial are, as in civil life, often associated with severe deep-seated injuries ; and superficial wounds, apparently unimportant, are often attended with or followed by serious accidents. Gunshot wounds are always of the contused class, those of civil life, however severe, are rarely, if ever, attended with that complete attrition and displacement, and even total removal of substance, which are so constantly characteristic of wounds produced by gunshots, particu- larly in those of recent times. Gunshot wounds, moreover, are also prone to be complicated by the introduction into the wound of some foreign body, such as some portion of the soldier’s dress pressed into the wound or some part of the wadding, shot, or shell itself. It should also be known that “ substances of very low degrees of den- sity, such as plugs of tallow, light wood, cork, wads of paper and others, will serve to inflict penetrating wounds in the softer structures of the body, having all the characters of wounds inflicted by denser pro- jectiles, if sufficient velocity be impressed upon them. But the neces- sary force to accomplish this result can only be executed within very limited distances.” (Longmore.) “ The external distinguishing signs of penetrating gunshot wounds are generally manifest enough. The general dimensions of the open- ing made by the shot sufficiently show whether it has been made by a small arm bullet, a large grape shot, or a still larger gunshot; its shape, whether it has been made by a round projectile, by a fragment of a shell, or an irregular splinter of some secondary missile, while the aspect and condition of the lips of the wound and of the structures immediately surrounding it, sufficiently mark it as not being one in- flicted by a stabbing or cutting instrument.” Gunshot wounds differ considerably in appearance, these dif- ferences depending upon the forms of the missiles causing the injury, and their speed, ns well as the part of the body struck, and the position of the patient relative to the projectile at the time of injury.ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. 51.0 When part of the body is carried away by a gunshot at full speed the surface of separation will present a level yet contused and almost pulpified aspect. When the speed is less rapid, the soft parts where the separation has taken place will be more lacerated and the bone comminuted; and when the speed is spent, or oblique in direction, the injured parts will either be crushed more or less deeply, or with little or no evidence of external injury, the deeper parts may be irreparably disorganised. Again, bullets when at full speed perforate or penetrate, but when at lessened speed they crush and lacerate. When a gun is discharged near the body, the parts around the wound of entrance will be blackened and burned, while the wound of entrance appears as if punched out. When the discharge of the musket takes place a few inches from the body, the injured tissues will be more or less scorched, blackened, and studded with grains of unexploded powder, and the wound of entrance large, ragged and excavated. Wounds from bullets not at full speed, and fired at a distance of two or three hundred yards, will present an opening the size of the projec- tile, or possibly smaller, circular in sbape, with serrated (inverted), undermined, puckered and flabby edges; at times, however, a flap of skin is found at the opening. The margin of the opening will appear as if contused, the evidences of bruising fading away into the surrounding tissues. When the speed of the bullet is much diminished, no skin may be carried away—the diminished speed of the missile simply stretching and tearing asunder the tissues to allow of entrance. When wadding or other foreign substance has been carried into the wound of entrance, this will of necessity be more lacerated and appear larger than it would otherwise be; and the same conditions may be Fig. 600. English and foreign bullets, now employed, of natural size. found to exist when a ball enters the body where bone is only covered with thin integument.ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. 541 In modern warfare where the rifle bullets are of a cylindro-conoidal form (Pig. 600), soft parts are more readily penetrated and bones more generally split or splintered than was found, of old, from the impact of round balls. In the late Franco-German war these points were generally observed, and although the Prussian and Bavarian balls were said to be larger than those of the French, the wounds produced by all were very much alike; if anything, however, the wound from the needle-gun produced the wider tract and larger opening. Indeed, in the “seton wounds,” or wounds penetrating the soft parts Penetrating alone, of all these balls it was often difficult to make out the wound ot "oun 3' entrance from the wound of exit. When they traversed the soft parts alone, they often ran so cleanly through them, that only slight suppura- tion followed and repair was rapid; these modern balls causing less severe lesions of the soft parts than the old spherical balls. Billroth asserts that wounds with split-like exits were remarkable for the amount of suppuration that followed. When bones were struck, no matter Comminution what the form of ball, the injury was alike; there was comminution, of boue- vertical splintering, and at times almost pulverisation. Indeed, in civil life there is nothing like the splintering and comminution of bones seen in wounds from rifle bullets. The amount of alteration in form which the projectiles assume after striking a bone is very remarkable—some being completely flattened, others strangely contorted, while many are split. Dr. Knester, of the Augusta Hospital, Berlin, however, has proved by experiment (1874), that the amount of injury the bones and soft parts sustain in a gunshot wound depends much upon the softness or hard- ness of the bullet—a hard one going through a part and leaving a “ seton wound,” where a soft one would produce frightful destruction of tissue. He explains this fact by the lead of the softer bullets becoming heated by collision with bone and broken up (not melted). The Martini-Henry bullet is a hard one and made of twelve parts hard lead, and one tin. The Chassepdt and the others are all made of soft lead, and consequently break up and flatten out against bone, thereby causing large apertures of exit and great laceration of tissue. When the head of a bone is struck it is probably comminuted. When bones are not broken but only bruised, acute periostitis and Bruising of endostitis are very common, the concussion of the bone being generally bone, so severe as to excite acute action. With the rifle-ball the course is more frequently direct than with Course of that from the old smooth-bored musket. Tortuous courses are even rifle ball, now met with, but less frequently, the weight of the ball and the ex- treme velocity with which it flies producing a more direct route. It penetrates the soft tissues in a direct line, and when it strikes bone either runs through or splinters it, entering it like a wedge. It will often appear, writes Longmore, that the track of a bullet, even at full speed, is widely removed from a straight line. But it usually is not difficult to reconcile the apparent irregularity in the course the projectile has taken if the many varied positions in which the body and its parts are liable to be placed are called to mind, and if, when making the examination, the surgeon takes care to place the patient in a similar position to that he was in when struck. The injury imparted to soft parts by what are called spent balls or spen^bails.542 ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. Ball to he extracted if possible. Blow from cannon balls at full speed. Not at full speed. ■When spent. Shell wounds. ricochet shots is the most destructive, and large projectiles “ rolling over” the surface of a part, or moving at low rates of speed, possess a force which will crush all parts with which they happen to come in contact, even extremities, and rupturing internal organs in a way peculiar to themselves. A conical rifle ball, when partially spent, may lodge in a part, either in a bone or some soft tissue. It may take some unusual path and lodge where the surgeon cannot find it, or cannot remove it; and under these circumstances, it may rest, become encysted, and give but little trouble. But, on the other hand, it may set up a chronic inflam- matory action in the part and give rise to local suppuration. Bullets, however, rarely lodge in the soft parts without giving rise to suppura- tion, although in bones they may do so. Such cases should not, however, induce the surgeon to leave them alone when they can be removed; they should always be extracted if possible, unless they have penetrated any of the great cavities of the body. Bill- roth speaks very strongly on this point. In all blind wound tracks of the extremities, the finger should be passed into the wound and the foreign body looked for, the external wound being enlarged when needed for this purpose ; and in non-penetrating wounds of the head, chest, ab- domen, and pelvis, the same practice may be observed. The removal of the ball as the cause of irritation has not only a beneficial influence on the body of the patient, but it has an equally beneficial influence upon the mind; for as long as the ball remains lost in the tissues, tlie soldier naturally regards it as a serious impediment to his re- covery, and there is no effect equal to that caused by its removal. Billroth has found much assistance from Nelaton’s sound in doubtful cases, but, as a rule, he says that projectiles that cannot be reached by the fingers can rarely be extracted, the bullet forceps, even the Ameri- can, being of small value. When a part of the body is carried away by a cannon hall at full speed, the stump will present a level surface of contused and almost pulpified tissues. The muscles and integument will not have re- tracted ; the extremity of the broken bone will probably stand out, small fragments of bone being scattered over the surface of the wound. When the same result follows the contact of a cannon hall, the force of which is partially expended, there will be evidence of more dragging and laceration of the soft parts, more irregularity of the wound, more hanging of the muscles, greater comminution of the bone, and greater injury to the soft parts above the seat of separation, and probably greater splintering of the bone upwards. When the force of the cannon hall is still less or spent, there may be no separation of impaired parts, but a general contusion, crushing, or disorganization. In some cases where the force is oblique, there may be no external evidence of injury, this want of external evidence being too commonly associated with broken bones or severe internal lacera- tion of viscera or soft parts. Such cases were formerly set down as due to “ wind contusions,” or, the “ brush of a shot,” but are now believed to be caused by contusions of nearly spent cannon balls, or glancing blows from some projectile. Shell wounds, as a rule, produce severe laceration of soft parts, and though they may penetrate tissues, yet they very rarely pass through them.ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. 543 The wounds produced by rifle-balls at full speed at the point of en- Rjfie.hall trance are often small, circular, clean cut, and with inverted edges; wounds, but at the point of exit large, irregular, and with everted edges. As the distance from the weapon increases and the velocity of the ball diminishes, so the wound of entrance becomes less circular and Wound of regular, larger and more contused; the wound “ sometimes consisting entrance, of three triangular flaps, which on being lifted up can be made to meet at their apices in the centre of the opening.”—Longmore. When the ball has passed through the part the wound of exit will Wound of probably be larger than the projectile, more irregular, torn, and everted exit, than that of entrance, the subcutaneous fat often projecting. At times, however, with the cylindro-conoidal bullet discharged at full speed, there is little difference between the two wounds. In the patient’s clothing, when the wound of entrance is punctured, that of exit will be lacerated. The pain caused by a gunshot wound depends upon the parts that Fain, are injured. In a general way it is not severe, and when so, is evanescent; writers tell us, that it is often described like the sudden stroke of a cane, or the shock of a heavy blow. Sometimes soldiers are unaware of their wounds. When the trunks of nerves are pushed aside and injured, intense pain may be felt, but not locally. Longmore relates the case of an officer, who, from his sensations, thought his arm was broken, but on examination no such injury existed, a ball had passed from right to left through his neck, which probably in- jured some of the cervical or brachial plexus of nerves, thereby giving rise to his error. More pain is occasionally felt at the wound of exit of a bullet than that of entrance. Shock.—“When a large bone is suddenly shattered, a cavity penetrated, an important viscus wounded, or a limb carried away by a round shot, the most prominent symptom is the general perturbation and alarm which in most cases instantaneously supervene on the injury. This is generally described as the ‘ shock ’ of the gunshot wound. The patient trembles and totters, is pale, complains of being faint, perhaps vomits. His features express extreme anxiety and distress. This emotion is in great measure instinctive, and seems to be sympathy of the whole frame with the part subjected to serious injury, expressed through the nervous system. This shock is more or less persistent, ac- cording to circumstances. Examples seem to show that it may occasionally be overpowered altogether, even in most severe injuries, by moral and nervous action of another kind, by a state of mental tension, but this can rarely happen when the injury is a vital one. Panic may lead to similar symptoms of shock, although the wound is Effects of of a less serious natui-e. A soldier, having his thoughts carried away shock, from himself, his whole frame stimulated to the utmost height of ex- citement by the continued scenes and circumstances of the tight, when he feels himself wounded is suddenly recalled to a sense of personal danger; and if he be seized with doubt whether his wound is mortal depression as low as liis excitement was high may immediately follow! This depression will vary in degree, according to individual character and intelligence, state of health and other personal peculiarities. For while, on the one hand, in every action numerous examples occur of men walking to the field hospital for assistance almost unsupported after the loss of an arm or other such severe injury; on the other, menON GUNSHOT INJURIES. 544 Hemorrhage.

Secondary. whose wounds are slight in proportion, are quite overcome, and require to be carried.” “ As a general rule, however, the graver the injury, the greater and more persistent is the amount of ‘ shock.’ A rifle bullet which splits up a long bone into many longitudinal fragments inflicts a very much more serious injury than the ordinary fracture effected by the ball from a smooth-bore musket, and the constitutional shock bears like pro- portion. When a portion of one or both of the lower extremities is carried away by a cannon ball, the higher towards the trunk the injury is inflicted the greater the shock, independent of the loss of blood. When a ball has entered the body, though its course be not otherwise indicated, the continuance of shock is a sufficient evidence that some organ essential to life has been implicated in the injury.”—Lonq- more. Haemorrhage.—The amount of haemorrhage attending a gunshot wound varies according to the size and situation of the wounded vessels. When large vessels are involved, death is rapid, and such cases do not come under the notice of the army surgeon. In the cases that come into the surgeon’s hands in a general way there has been an attack of haemorrhage directly after the injury, but little more; possibly some oozing, but rarely much, may exist. When a limb is shot off, there is rarely more bleeding than when it has been torn off by machinery as seen in civil life. Large vessels, when torn or twisted, seldom bleed. In these cases the plugged pulsating extremity of the lacerated artery will generally be found projecting from the wound. In the wounds caused by rifle-balls, vessels escape in a marvellous manner, the great resiliency of large vessels and the freedom with which they slip away under pressure from their loose cellular connections, allowing a ball to pass along or across their course without wounding them. At times the vessel may be so contused as to become obstructed and obliterated (vide Prep, at Netley). Nevertheless, a rifle-hall occa- sionally may directly divide a large artery and cause instantaneous death. In the American war, among the cases of primary gunshot lesions of the arteries that came under treatment, it was found that in most, only a portion of the calibre of the vessel had been carried away, and that retraction had thus been prevented. Secondary haemorrhage is common in gunshot wounds, and is due probably, as a rule, to the reopening of a wound in a vessel tem- porarily closed, or to the sloughing of some part of its walls that had been injured. In the former case, the new tissue that had stopped for a time the flow of blood, gives way under some sudden movement or local mechanical force such as some foreign body in the wound; or breaks down during the suppurative or sloughing process. In the latter, the injured coats of the artery are castoff, having been destroyed by some contusion or other violence. In either case the thrombus or clot in tbe vessel is not sufficiently well formed or organized to resist the force of the blood current from behind. When such a clot organizes, there will, of course, be no bleeding. “The great frequency of secondary haemorrhage has for its chief causes the absence or faultiness of sanitary conditions, and the debility of the patient, due to privation of nourishing food, and to exposure. The means calculated to remove or anticipate such evils will, if545 ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. applied, be of more value than is the ligature iu coping with secondary bleeding after gunshot injury.”—Mac Cormac. With respect to the treatment of secondary haemorrhage after gun- Treatment of shot wounds it is iu principle, similar to that which the civil surgeon secondary follows. Styptics where large vessels are concerned are worse than 1Eemon a'-e- useless. Pressure is only applicable for temporary, hut not curative pur- poses,and thus the surgeon is driven to cut downupon thewoundedartery to tie or twist both ends, or, to apply the same practice to the vessel in its continuity leading to the seat of bleeding when the former operation is too difficult or dangerous. Billroth advocates dealing with the main trunk of the bleeding vessel at an early period of the haemorrhage, and not wasting time by delay. He says that out of twenty-three cases in which he applied a ligature to large arteries for haemorrhage, death took place in seven from bleeding on the separation of the ligature, when no clot was found in the vessel; in twelve from haemorrhage and pyaemia, of which no examination was made, and seven alone re- covered. In the late Continental war Stromeyer, and Mac Cormac maintain that the result of such operations was uniformly unfavorable. Out of twelve cases which Stromeyer saw, only two recovered. “ I think,” he says, “we must decide to amputate oftener in cases of secondary haemorrhage.” Possibly a better result might have followed torsion of the arteries, for, after such a practice, when bleeding has been arrested, there is nothing to set up fresh mischief in the artery, no foreign body like the ordinary ligature to excite any ulcerative or disorganizing process through which hemorrhage may take place; the thrombus that forms in the vessels after torsion, being allowed to go on undisturbed, to organize and to become incorporated with the incurved middle arterial coat as one firm organized fibrinous mass. The catgut ligature, how- ever, may possibly be of use in these cases. Treatment.—In the front of the battle-field little more can be done Treatment, in the way of treatment of gunshot wounds than the application of some provisional dressing; some pressure or tourniquet to arrest lias- Provisional, morrhage when the vessel cannot be at once secured; some splint or other available support to prevent extra injury being inflicted by move- ment to the field hospital. Before examining a wound, the cloths that cover it should be carefully looked to, and more particularly the garment next the skin, for “ it occasionally happens that a bullet will have sufficient force to penetrate the body to a limited distance, at the same time carrying a portion of the wouuded man’s shirt before it, while, owing to the yielding nature of the material it fails to tear a piece out of it. The bullet will then lie, as it were, at the bottom of a pouch of the shirt like the finger in a glove; and when the shirt is taken out the bullet will be brought away with it.” Longmore, in his recent work on “ gunshot injuries,” relates several instances of the kind. At the field hospital the wound should be thoroughly and carefully Final examined, and to do so, the patient should be placed, when practicable as near as possible in the position he occupied when he received it. All foreign bodies must be taken away, bleeding vessels ought to be ligatured or twisted; and, when necessary, the wound should be enlarged for the purpose. No make-shift of pressure or other temporising means should be employed. When great collapse or “ shock ” exists some gentle stimulant may he given. The true condition of parts is VOL. ii. 35ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. 546 Exploration of wound. By finger.

By far the best instrument to explore a wound is the finger, and for this purpose the external opening through the fascia may always be enlarged. “Probes should seldom or never be used; the finger is by far the best instrument if the wound will admit it ” (John Hunter, MS. lect., 1787). “ No artificial instrument can give the same amount of information or afford information so precise with regard to the lodgment of foreign bodies and their nature as the surgeon’s finger can give. The surgeon should not withdraw the finger until the course the projectile has taken, the injury it has done, the complications of the wound, such as the presence of foreign bodies, and, in such a case, their kind and situation, have been decided by him; the exploration will then be completed by one operation, and a second insertion of the finger for the purpose, which is always irritating to a patient will be avoided.” The knowledge gained, moreover, will be definite and of special utility in determining the proceedings to be afterwards adopted. The exploration is often assisted by pressing tbe soft parts, especially if the wound be in one of the extremities, from an opposite direction towards the finger end.” Sometimes, when a lodged ball cannot other- wise be discovered, it may be found by passing the flat palm of the hand down the limb. “ Sometimes,” writes Longmore, “it may be detected simply by relaxing the muscular tissues, so as to give a loose and pendulous condition to the parts concerned, and then lightly tossing up the flesh at different points from below with the tips of the fingers.” When the finger passes through an opening in fascia or a deep aponeurosis, the track will feel constricted, when through muscles and connective tissue expanded. When sufficient information cannot be acquired through the finger either from the length of the wound or its tortuosities, probes must be used. Nelaton’s (Fig. 601), with a small ball of porcelain at the end, is good, and so also Sayre’s snake-jointed probe, with a like end. Longmore prefers a long silver probe, which can be bent to any angle, but speaks highly of Dr. Lecomte’s stylet-pince. Fig. 601. Lecomte’s Stylet-pince. a. Cannula moving over; (i) clelt steel rod with closed curettes at end,fixed in handle ; (c) the gliding of the cannula determining the opening or closing of the curettes; (d) curettes open grasping bullet. It responds as an indicator with even more distinctness than the547 ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. Nelaton probe in all cases in which the test would be of service, while it answers for a variety of other cases in which Nelaton’s probe would give no indication at all. By it small particles of the substance em- bedded in the tissues can be extracted for examination, and many foreign substances altogether removed. In gunshot fractures of the shafts of bones which are to be treated conservatively, Stromeyer advises that no probing ought to be performed, and in doubtful or in operation cases, it ought only to be done just before the operation or under chloroform. Electric indicators have been employed, and some are most ingenious Electric and possibly valuable, but they are not portable. The appliance of Mr. indicators. De Wilde, in which contact with the metal of a ball is notified by the sound of a bell is particularly taking, and a very useful apparatus has also been made by Messrs. Krohne and Sesemann, of Duke Street, Manchester Square. Professor Longmore speaks highly of both, but prefers the latter. It is designed to ascertain with absolute certainty, if a substance lodged in the body, and admitting of being touched with the probe or grasped with the forceps, is a bullet, a fragment of a pro- jectile, or other metallic substance. The probe is elastic, and follows the track of any projectile more readily than a stiff probe. Two sharp needles are concealed in it, which, when a hard body is felt, are pushed forwards one after the other. This is done by pressing the small but- tons on the handles towards the probe. As soon as the two points touch the foreign substance, if it be metal, the electric current passes through the instrument, a fact immediately indicated by the hand on the dial. The hand moves actively either towards the right or left side. The forceps possess this principal advantage that they can be also used as a probe, thereby dispensing in many cases with the use of the elastic probe altogether. The extremities are furnished with Assalini’s points, with which particles of clothing can be removed, if such should be before the projectile. If a foreign body is touched with the forceps it should be gently grasped between both blades. If it be a bullet or any piece of metallic projectile, the electric currrent passes through it, and the hand on the dial moves again actively, as described above. It is, of course, necessary to fix the connecting wires of the instrument into the brass heads on each side of the dial. In the drawer below the dial there is a small battery charged with sulphate of mercury. If the charge has become too dry and weak it should be moist- ened with a few drops of water, and a few pinches of sulphate of mer- cury should be added. It is to be observed that the zinc plate touches the platinum points in the trough. In exceptional and chronic cases where time has been allowed to pass, these instruments are of greater use than in primary cases. It need hardly be re-asserted that when a ball has penetrated any of the cavities of the body such as the head, chest, or abdomen, it is not to be sought for on any account. When a foreign body has been detected it should be removed; at least Removal of this is the rule. Coxeter’s extractor, composed of a scoop for holding bullet, and a pin for fixing the bullet has been highly praised (Pig. 601). Instruments with blades cannot be recommended as they necessitate the dilatation of the wound. Mac Corrnac writes, “ The bullet forceps I preferred was one with claw Forceu- points, at a right angle with the handle, and slightly overlapping, so as *548 ON GUNSHOT INJURIES. to admit of easy ingress. When these catch the bullet they rarely let it slip. The extraction of bullets, however, requires skill and patience; much injury may be inflicted on surrounding parts by the incautious use of the bullet forceps.” Enlargement When, from the smallness of the wound of entrance, force is re- o woun . quired, it is better to enlarge than to stretch the wound. When the foreign body rests beneath the skin, an opening through it may be made. When in When balls lodge in bone, they should be removed as from soft parts; )0ue- when they can be raised from their bed by an elevator, such an instru- ment should be employed. When forceps are wanted for extraction Luer’s “ sharp-pointed bullet forceps, which bite into and secure a most firm grasp of the object, will best accomplish the extraction.” To aid extraction the gouging away of some part of the bone may be necessary. Wounds into ■ As a rule, however, with rifle balls, the bone is splintered; and, under these circumstances, when the epiphysis of the bone is involved, exci- sion of the joint is called for when the joints of the upper extremity or the head of the femur is involved, and amputation when the knee and ankle are injured. After the removal of all foreign bodies from the wound, and when the parts have been cleansed, they should be carefully adjusted, placed at rest in an easy position, and protected by wet or dry lint; union by adhesion is out of all question, and that by granulation alone can take place. To hermetically seal a wound is not a practice to be generally recommended. Some gentle support by means of a bandage not only gives comfort, but is beneficial. When suppuration has taken place, the greatest care is needed to prevent burrowing. As soon as abscesses form they should be lanced, and that freely. When the wounds of entrance and exit are opened, the intervening sinus may be syringed with advantage, some medicated lotion such as iodine water, Condy’s solution, or carbolic acid, one part to a hundred, being used. Under all circumstances, thorough cleanliness should be observed, good food with tonics and sedatives given; fresh air being allowed to circulate freely around the beds. Stimulants should be administered with great caution, enough only being allowed to assist the digestion of solid food. Gunshot wounds of soft parts usually suppurate about the third or fourth day, sloughs mostly separate about the tenth or fourteenth; and recovery takes place in five or six weeks, the wound of exit, as a rule, closing before that of entrance. Gunshot Wounds of the Head. A gunshot wound' of the head received from a rifle ball at full speed produces a diffused injury to the skull and its contents; when caused by a spent ball or by a fragment of shell, the injury may be localised. In the former cases the external evidence of injury bears no com- parison with the real mischief the patient has sustained. In the latter the external evidence may be greater than the internal. Thus, the perience, says Professor Longmore, of the military surgeon, leads Gunshot wounds of the head.ON GUNSHOT INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 549 him always to hesitate in forming a prognosis, however limited a gun- shot injury may appear to he at first observation. Gunshot injuries are, moreover, specially prone to he followed by diffused meningitis, encephalitis, and the formation of deep-seated abscesses, this proneness to traumatic inflammation being clearly due to the injury the brain itself with its membranes has sustained; for in head injuries with which the civilian is familiar, this tendency to trau- matic encephalitis bears a direct proportion to the injury of the cranial contents. The opening made into the skull by a pistol hall when at full speed is clean and defined; that of exit larger and bevelled outwards. They are rarely complicated with fissures. When, however, the velocity of the ball is in a manner modified, there may he the same amount ot “starring ” at the wound as is seen by the civil surgeon. In military as in civil practice, the inner table of the skull is always fractured to a greater extent than the outer when the ball enters from without {vide Figs. 602-3, taken from Longmore’s article in ‘ Holmes’s Fig. 602. Fig. 603. Wound- of Entrance. Wound qfjEieit. System ’); but the opposite condition exists when the ball passes through the skull on the opposite side of the cranium, the table of the skull corresponding to the point of exit of the hall suffering the most in both cases. In military, as in civil practice the amount of external injury is no External indication of the amount of internal mischief. A spent hall, a frag- injur-v '!° ment of shell, a stone, may cause what appears to be only a contusion Internal"11 °f of the scalp, yet a fracture may co-exist with such a contusion, and a considerable amount of intra-cranial mischief follow. “ The amount of bruising obvious to sight and the degree of concussion may have seemed trifling, and yet the remote consequences may he serious enough.”—Longmore. Contused gunshot injuries without any external evidence of cranial Contusing mischief, are at times associated with such intra-cranial injury as to be shots of head., followed by a speedy death. “Contusing and glancing shots,” says Dr. Neudorfer, of Prague, iu his ‘ Manual of Military Surgery,’ will either occasion fissures, fractures, or depressions, or not interfere with the integrity of the skull at all, according to the velocity of the pro- jectile and the elasticity and power of resistance of the hones.”ON GUNSHOT INJURIES OP THE HEAD. 550 Injury to bone. Fracture of inner table without that of outer. Comminuted fractures. Wounds with fracture and depression. Severe scalp wounds are generally caused by the impact of a pro- jectile at an acute angle. Under such circumstances, the bone is often left intact, and little or no injury to the brain results. At a less acute angle, the bone may be bruised, scratched, or fur- rowed, fissured, starred, or comminuted, and with these several con- ditions, more or less severe brain symptoms may be associated, the gravity of the symptoms depending on the severity of the concussion. Concussion in military as in civil experience means either a tem- porary suspension of brain functions, a contusion or laceration of the brain structure, or a more or less severe extravasation of blood upon or into the brain itself. A severe contusion of the skull without fracture being quite capable of producing a fatal laceration of a sinus. “A simple observation of the injury to the outer table, whether by sight or touch, will by no means necessarily lead to a knowledge of the amount of injury or change of position in the inner table.”—Long- more. Indeed, it is quite possible for a piece of the inner table of the skull to be fractured and detached without any fracture of the external taking place. This is illustrated in Figs. 604-5, taken from the draw- ing of what is believed to be a unique specimen (2313, A. M. M.), in the United States’ Museum, published in Circular No. 6. Fig. 604. Fig. 605. Circular No 6, Figs. 4 and 5, Washington. Fig. 604.—Exterior view of the fore-mentioned specimen. Fig. 605.—Fracture of the vitreous table of the frontal bone, without fracture of the external. When the external table has been ploughed off by the projectile, care should be taken not to mistake such an injury for a fracture of both tables with depression. In military, as in civil practice too, fissured fractures are mostly the result of blows by heavy projectiles, and fissures of the inner table without external evidence of the injury, occasionally occur. Comminuted fractures in both military and civil experience are also chiefly local injuries, the force of the ball or blow expending itself on the injured spot. Wounds complicated with fracture and depressed bone without lodg-ON GUNSHOT INJURIES OP THE HEAD. -551 ment of the projectile are most serious. Of seventy-six cases recorded afcer the Crimean campaign, fifty-five proved fatal, and of the twenty- one survivors twelve had to be invalided; “the severe concussion of the whole osseous sphere by tbe stroke of the projectile, the bruising and injury to the bony texture immediately surrounding the spot against which it has directly impinged, as well as the contusion of the external soft parts, so that the wound cannot close by tbe adhesive process, constitute very important differences between gunshot injuries on the one side and others.”—Longmore. Fractures of the cranium from gunshot wounds are not unfrequently Bullet often complicated with the retention of the projectile. It may be that the ietame ball has been flattened against the bone and lodged in the wound, or it may be that it has been split against the fractured cranium, one portion entering the skull and the other the integument. Under either circumstance, the segment that enters the skull may lodge either between the bone and the dura mater, or lacerate the membranes and enter the brain. Longmore gives a case in which there was a fissured fracture with slight depression, but no hole in the skull, where after death, half the rifle-bullet was found in the brain, the hole through which the half bullet had forced admittance having closed as soon as it had entered the skull. He gives, also, another precisely similar, which reflects great credit upon the surgeon, Dr. B. Howard, of the United States, in which, from the presence of a single hair protruding from within the broken bone, it was inferred that a solid substance had entered the skull. Trephining was performed, a distorted Minie ball removed, and recovery ensued. Rifle bullets at the usual speed, however, in the majority of cases enter the cerebral mass, to make their exit, in some instances, at the opposite side of the skull, in others to rest beneath the opposite wall; at times, the ball takes a circuitous route. In all death follows, as a Perforating rule, no exception to this fact having been reported from the Crimean wound* war. Treatment.—To do nothing active when death appears imminent Treatment, is a duty the student has to learn, but iu the primary treatment of head injuries in the stage of collapse, iu military as in civil practice, there is no more stringent rule than to abstain from interference, to wait and to watch. The patient should be relieved of all unnecessary dress; Immediate, no tight belts or garment being allowed to interfere with the respira- tion. He should be placed in the horizontal position, and when moved from necessity, it should be done as gently as possible. When the extremities are cold extra covering may be applied and artificial warmth when possible. As the case develops, its surgical treatment ought to be conducted As case on precisely similar principles to those laid down in former chapters, develops. Practice is to be established on the preventive principle, to ward off intra-cephalic inflammation; perfect quiet, cold applications to the head, and liquid food, being the three essentials.

When they have entered the skull, and still more the brain, all search is forbidden ; but when situated at the external orifice they should be taken away, and the sooner the better. If a ball be so impacted as to be immovable, the wound in the broken bone may be enlarged to favour its extraction, but no unnecessary interference with the552 ON GUNSHOT INJURIES OP THE HEAD. Trephining. Removal of bone fragments. Summary. cranium or its contents should bo entertained. All foreign bodies in the integuments outside the skull ought to be taken away as soon as discovered. The opinion of most surgeons is decidedly against the operation of trephining in gunshot wounds of the head. When the operation is entertained it should only be in compound fractures with depression attended with brain symptoms. The experience of the Crimean war, of our own as well as of French surgeons—of the Schleswig-Holstein and Franco-Prussian wars as recorded by Stromeyer—of the Indian war as told us by Dr. Williamson, is, without doubt, decidedly against this operation. In the Crimean campaign, the trephine was only success- fully employed in four cases in our own army, and among the French, it was for the most part fatal. The late American war, however, gives us a more favorable result, but the report itself states that “ the data are not sufficiently com- plete to admit of fair comparative analysis,” so judgment must be withheld. In compound fracture, loose fragments may always be removed. In all penetrating wounds of the skull with lodgment of the projectile, operative interference is out of all question. As a rule, writes Mac Cormac, “ the largest proportion of good results will obtain amongst those cases where the amount of operative surgery has been at a minimum.” By way of summary, it may be remembered, that cerebral concus- sion, rupture of one of the cerebral sinuses, and fatal intra-cranial haemorrhage may take place from a gunshot projectile without any external marks of injury, and that a gunshot injury of the head, followed by a scalp wound, without any cerebral symptom, may be followed by inflammation of the bone and meningitis. The vitreous or inner table of the skull may be fissured, depressed, and even detached, without any fracture of the external table. The drawings taken from Circular VI of the Washington War Department, illustrate the fact (Fig. 604-5), such accident being probably the result of a small projectile striking the cranium very obliquely. Fissure of the internal table may also co-exist with a linear fissure of the external table. A ball may gouge out a portion of the external table of the skull without injuring the cranial contents. The part or the whole of a ball, may partially penetrate the skull and be retained, or not enter it, or pass through it; the wound of exit through the thickness of bone, or through the two sides being larger than the wound of entrance. Penetrating and perforating fractures of the cranium terminate favorably in quite exceptional instances. Hernia or fungus cerebri may take place after gunshot, as after other injuries, and recovery in these cases may occur, the experience of surgeons in the American war clearly showing that this result is more likely to take place without, than with compression or operative interference. Trephining may only be undertaken with a fair prospect of success in local fractures with depression and brain symptoms; loose fragments of bone being always removed in all compound wounds.ON GUNSHOT INJURIES OF THE CHEST. 553 Gunshot Wounds of the Chest. Gunshot wounds of chest. Non- penetraling These are returned as one in ten among the officers and one in seven- teen amongst the men in the Crimean war, about 30 per cent, of these died; in the American war the mortality was 73 per cent. Non-penetrating gunshot wounds generally recover, although they are slow in healing, on account of the natural movements of the ribs interrupting the process of repair. They are, moreover, apt to be followed by pleuritis, on account of the frequency of the ball taking a circuitous course beneath the skin round the walls of the chest. When the chest has been severely contused from a spent ball or a heavy fragment of shell, abscesses or even necrosis of the ribs are prone to follow the accident, and from the same character of accident where there is no fracture, the lungs may be injured, this result being like- wise met with in young subjects in civil practice when the chest is squeezed. Professor Longmore states that “ecchymosis, or at least congestion of the lung itself, to a partial extent, in all probability follows every non-penetrating gunshot wound of the chest of much severity.” The ribs may likewise be broken and driven in, as in the direct blows of civil life. Penetrating gunshot wounds are generally fatal, scarcely more than Penetratin one in ten surviving, while death generally results directly from harnior- rhage, or from the consequences of secondary inflammation of the thoracic organs. The difficulties of diagnosis in these cases are as great as they are in civil practice, especially if the bullet be small and has entered obliquely near the scapula, or if the track of the bullet is covered by sound skin. “ It is only,” says Longmore, “ by a combi- nation of symptoms, rather than by the presence of any one or other symptom, that a lung wound can in many instances be diagnosed.” Penetrating wounds with lodgment of the ball are more fatal than perforating wounds, and a fracture of the rib at the wound of entry reuders a penetrating wound more dangerous. When the lung has been wounded by a penetrating shot, shock, collapse, escape of air, haemorrhage from the external wound and from the lung, hsemothorax and dyspnoea are characteristic symptoms. The shock is, however, frequently less in penetrating than in non-penetrating wounds when the latter are attended with general concussion. It is remarkable that a lung may at times be completely traversed by a ball, and beyond the haemoptysis and dyspnoea of the first few days'be followed by only the most trivial symptoms. External bleeding in chest injuries is also said to be more commonly due to laceration of an intercostal or the internal mammary artery than to a wounded lunar. Wonndcil lung. External haemorrhage. Internal bleeding is the chief cause of death, but the surgeon has no Internal means at his disposal to make out the exact source of the haemorrhage, htemorrhage. A gush of blood from the mouth indicates the opening of a large vessel, but in more chronic cases the sources of the bleeding may be pulmonary or parietal. “ The situation of the wound of entrance, or the course the ball has taken, inferred from the relative positions of the wounds of entrance and exit, will greatly help to determine the probable site of the bleeding, and to some extent its probable decree of gravity. Internal bleeding from a wounded intercostal artery is very rare.”ON GUNSHOT ABDOMINAL INJURIES. 554 Gunshot woumls of heart. Treatment. Gunshot wounds of the heart are always fatal, although not always immediately. In a case recorded in Circular No. Ill of the War Depart- ment of Washington the patient survived fifty hours, the pistol ball having wounded the right auricle. Treatment.—To arrest hemorrhage, to remove fragments of bone or foreign bodies, and to do nothing that can interfere with nature’s reparative processes, are the three great principles of practice to be observed. They are, indeed, precisely similar to those the civil surgeon follows. In bleeding from an intercostal artery, the best plan is to plug the opening, at least so says Professor Longmore. This may be done in the following way :—“ A large piece of linen is laid upon that part of the chest in which the wound is placed, and the middle portion of this linen is pressed into the wound by the finger, so as to form a kind of pouch. This pouch is then distended by sponge or lint pushed into it until the pressure arrests the bleeding; on stretching out the corners of the cloth the pressure of the plug will be increased.” If the wound is not attended with haemorrhage it should be cleaned and lightly closed, the side being strapped up to restrain movement. Hermetically sealing gunshot wounds of the chest is reprehensible. The patient should be laid on the wounded side with the wound down- wards, to allow of the escape of discharges. In all other respects, the treatment of gunshot wounds is similar to that of others, and the remarks already made are applicable to them. Venesection is less commonly employed now than it was by the surgeons of the Peninsular war, and in the American war appears to have been abandoned. The dangers of inflammation of the contents of the chest are the chief source of the surgeon’s anxiety, and his aim ought to be to prevent them if possible, and when present to check them. Haemorrhage should be treated by the application of cold, perfect rest, and the administration of opium. When empyema follows as a secondary result, a free outlet may be made for the accumulated fluid. Gunshot Wounds of the Abdomen. Gunshot These are mostly penetrating, and non-penetrating wounds are often wounds of associated with some injury of the abdominal viscera. Longmore in- the abdomen. forms us that in the Crimean campaign, out of 115 non-penetrating wounds and contusions, 22 deaths occurred, these cases including those of injured viscera. When death follows a non-penetrating wound it is, as a rule, from sloughing of the abdominal walls. Penetratin''. Penetrating gunshot abdominal wounds are generally fatal, nine out of ten of the Crimean cases, French and English, having been so recorded. In the American campaign the mortality was 74 per cent. Shock is always very great, and collapse from haemorrhage the most striking symptom. This is, indeed, says Longmore, “ sometimes the only symptom which will enable the surgeon to diagnose that the viscera are perforated. The mind remains clear, but the prostration, oppressive anxiety, and restlessness are intense. Should life be prolonged, signs of peritonitis will soon appear.” In musket-shot wounds, it is exceptional for any of the abdominal contents to escape from the opening; but when they do, the nature of the wounded viscus will be indicated. The swelling of the margins of the wound accounts for this fact.ON GUNSHOT ABDOMINAL INJURIES. 555 Wounds of the liver are attended with a large mortality, and are Wounds of always complicated. Shock and haemorrhage are the usual immediate hver. causes of death; but when life is prolonged, peritonitis. Longmore Very fatal, saw only one case of recovery in the Crimea; while Dr. Otis records 4 recoveries, in America, out of 32 cases of this form of injury. In Circular No. Ill of the Washington War Department 4 cases of reco- very out of 15 from this injury are recorded, and in one the gall- bladder was wounded. Wounds of the spleen are almost always fatal Of spleen, from haemorrhage; and are generally complicated with other injuries. Gunshot wounds of the stomach are not always fatal. They are Of stomach, made out to exist when the contents of the organ escape externally, or when, from the extent of wound, the viscus can be seen. They are always associated with vomiting of blood. Hennen records two good cases of recovery which occurred at Waterloo, and the well-known American case of Alexis St. Martin, reported by Beaumont, is another. Dr. Peters, of the United States Army, has also reported a case that oc- curred in the American war. Guthrie and Cooper give nine or ten others. When the wound is incised, it should be stitched up. Opium should Treatment, be administered with nutrient enemata. Nothing should be given by the mouth for some days. Gunshot wounds of the intestines are not necessarily fatal, although Gunshot instances of recovery are rare. Wounds of the large are not so bad as wounds of the small intestine. Haemorrhage, and, if not, perito- nitis, is the usual cause of death. Longmore relates one case in which recovery took place. Dr. Hamilton, of New York (1865), quotes eight cases of faecal fistula which terminated in recovery by natural processes, all having taken place in the late American war, and in the older writers many more might be found. Dr. Habershon has recorded a most interesting case of gunshot wound of the colon through the right loin, the patient dying four years subsequently from albuminuria (' Guy’s Reports,’ 1859). Treatment.—Absolute quiet is the most essential point to be Treatment, observed in these, as in all other eases of abdominal injuries. The recumbent position should be enforced and maintained under all cir- cumstances. Opium or morphia should also be given in repeated doses, no drug having a better infiuence in peritoneal inflammation. Absolute cleanliness of the wound should also be observed, but there should be no strapping or closing of the orifice. Simple nutritious food maybe allowed and, as the case progresses, solids may gradually be taken. Fcecal fistula} appear to have a tendency to close by themselves. In the American cases they gave, in general, but little trouble in their management (Circ. No. 6, S. G. 0., 1865). With regard to exploring the track of the wound the surgeon Exploration should never forget, says Lidell (‘American Quart.,’ 1867), “that in oi wound, the management of these cases, art, to be useful, must be the servant of nature, and must seek to do good by assisting her mistress in the efforts at repair, and not by the introduction of new and violent mea- sures which are liable to aggravate the original injury.” He believes that neither the finger nor any instrument should be used for ex- ploratory purposes, except in special cases. Dr. Otis, however, in Cir- cular No. Ill of the Washington War Department, issued in 1871, p. 87, says that “the mortality of these cases is so great as to furnish an Leparotomy.556 ON GUNSHOT INJURIES OF THE BLADDER, ETC. Wounds of bladder. Removal of foreign bodies. Gunshot wounds of face. Of neck. Of extremities. additional argument in behalf of Legouest’s proposition to incise the abdominal walls and explore the track of the projectile in certain pene- trating wounds. Thus only can the patient exchange the probability of inevitable death for the possibility of recovery, either through the prevention of extravasation by enterorrhaphy, or the bringing of the wounded viscus into apposition with the abdominal walls. For one, I am free to assert that where there is evidence that internal hemor- rhage or fecal extravasation is going on, what may be termed the ‘ ostrich plan’ of giving opium and making the patient comfortable should be abandoned; and I believe that prejudices similar to those that ovariotomy has successfully overcome in the last quarter of a century will be dispelled by the results of exploratory incisions in gunshot wounds of the abdomen before many years have elapsed.” Gunshot wounds of the bladder do not appear to be so fatal as the cases of ruptured bladder met with in civil life. Lidell reports two such cases where a good recovery followed, the projectile in both having passed completely through the organ. Guthrie has related six, in all of which recovery took place. Mac Cormac records a case in which the ball passed through the rectum and bladder, the faeces for a time passing through the posterior opening, and the urine through the anterior. Both wounds closed by natural processes in seventeen days. In all of these the urine escaped externally through the wound made by the projectile, and thus prevented fatal peritonitis from taking place. Such instances as these indicate the proper practice to be pur- sued in all cases of ruptured bladder, viz. cystotomy, as for lateral litho- tomy. When foreign bodies have been carried into the bladder they should be removed, as a ball may remain in the bladder and become the nucleus of a calculus. Guthrie, Hennen, Cheselden, and Garengeot have given such cases, and Ballingall has collected nineteen. In Circular No. Ill of the Washington War Department three cases are recorded in which calculi were removed which had formed on bullets; one where a stone had concreted upon an arrow-head, and one on necrosed bone. Gunshot wounds of the face are serious from the fact that they are so frequently followed by secondary haemorrhage; and, as the deep vessels are usually its source, the difficulties of controlling it are always great. When this complication does not destroy life, good recoveries take place, wounds of the face always healing kindly and with little scar. When there is much loss of tissue, some secondary plastic opera- tion may be required, and many are the instances of success following this practice. Gunshot wounds of the neck are serious according to the nature of the parts involved. When the large vessels and nerves are injured, a fatal result generally takes place; and when the larynx or trachea is implicated, the risks of suffocation are great not only from the direct result of the injury, but from secondary oedema; when this latter com- plication occurs tracheotomy should at once be performed. Wounds of the neck are very liable to be followed by septicaemia. Wounds involving the vertebrae are usually fatal, those cases alone recovering where the spinous or transverse processes are the parts injured. Gunshot wounds of the extremities include flesh wounds and con-ON GUNSHOT INJURIES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 557 fusions, fractures which are rarely simple, and compound fractures, wounds of joints, and compound fractures into joints. All these may be complicated with some injury to the vessels and nerves of the part, and the lodgment of foreign bodies or projectiles. Gunshot flesh wounds usually do well unless complicated with lesions of the vessels and nerves. Fractures from gunshot wounds are sometimes simple, hut more Causing commonly compound. When simple, they are generally caused by blows fracture, from spent balls or other projectiles, the bones usually being split or comminuted and contused, the soft parts equally suffering, and the bones, not rarely, being split vertically into a neighbouring joint When compound the same comminution and splintering of the hone is commonly present, associated with other complications, such as severe laceration of the soft parts, involving arteries, veins, or nerves, with their attendant dangers, lodgment of fragments, or the whole of the foreign body in the bone or soft parts, and some joint complication from the splitting of the bone into the joint, or from direct injury to the joint. Military surgeons, however, writes Professor Longmore (in ‘ Holmes’s Partial System ’), meet with cases of partial fracture. “ 1. Removal of portion fracture, of a bone by the projectile making a furrow in its passage across its surface, grooving it. 2. Removal by splintering off longitudinal frag- ments from the external cylindrical part of a hone. 3. Removal of part of the bone by completely punching out a portion, thus leaving a hole through the entire substance of the hone. 4. Partial fracture by driving inwards part of the external cylinder, and causing the fragment to lodge in the cancellated structure, with or without lodg- ment of the projectile.” Of complete fractures, the peculiarity consists in the comminution, Complete and vertical splintering of the bone, and of the complete removal of fracture, some part of the shaft of the hone, the term “ resecting fractures ” Resecting being applied to such. One curious fact occasionally produced by the fractures, heavy conoidal hall is noticed in Circular No. VI of the Washington War Department, in which the bone is fissured and comminuted, though less than is common, at the point at which the ball impinges, while at two or three inches above or below this point a nearly trans- verse fracture of the shaft is produced. In some of the specimens the transverse fracture is not connected by fissures with the fracture pro- duced by the ball. These injuries, probably, are due to balls fired at short ranges. When conoidal bullets, writes Longmore, happen to strike on or below the trochanters of the femur, they usually leave the head and neck of the hone intact, but cause fissures, which often extend to a long distance down the shaft; when they pierce the head, all the parts below usually escape fracture; when the neck is perforated the fracture generally extends both upwards and downwards. The same rule holds good with regard to the upper extremity of the humerus, although not in so marked a manner.

Fractures of the lower extremity are more liable to be followed by such blood poisoning than those of the upper, the susceptibility being much determined by the size of the venous canals ; the larger and more numerous the veins of a part, the greater the danger of septicaemia. In gunshot wounds of the pelvic bones Stromeyer believes the liability to pyaemia to be very great, and that cold and exposure favour its de- velopment. Gunshot fractures of the upper extremity are far less fatal than those of the lower, and “ unless the bone be extensively injured by a massive projectile, or longitudinal comminution exist to a great extent, especially if also involving a joint, or the state of the patient’s health be very unfavorable, attempts should always be made to save the limb.” —Longmore. When the bone is much splintered an examination by the finger for foreign bodies or detached pieces of bone should be made as well as their removal. Sharp points of projecting spiculae should be sawn off, the most dependent wound being extended when necessary, or a fresh incision made for the purpose in a dependent position when only one wound exists, the case being then treated as an ordinary com- pound fracture. If the shoulder and elbow-joint be opened and the condition of the soft parts, vessels, &c., is not such as to necessitate amputation, excision of the joint should be performed, the experience of all recent campaigns indicating this very strongly. Gunshot wounds of the wrist too often demand amputation; excision is not expedient, and (where the major operation is not imperatively demanded, attempts to save the limb should be made. The same remarks apply to injuries to the fingers and hand, and only such portions as are irreparably damaged should be removed; for the value of a piece of thumb and one finger, of whatever kind, is hardly to be over-estimated, and every effort should be made to preserve whatever parts can possibly be saved. Gunshot fractures of the lower extremity are far more grave accidents than those of the upper. Longmore lays it down as a general rule, that ordinary fractures below the knee from rifle balls should never cause primary amputation; while, excepting in certain special cases, in fracture above the knee, amputation is held by most military surgeons to be a necessary measure. The special cases are gunshot fractures of the upper third of the femur, especially if it be doubtful whether the hip-joint is impli- cated or not; as in these, the danger attending amputation is so great that the question is still open whether the safety of the patient is best consulted by excision of tbe injured portion of the lemur, by removal of detached fragments, and trusting to natural effects for union, or, by resorting to amputation. The decision of the surgeon must generally rest upon the extent of injury to the soft parts, the age, condition of the patient, and sur- rounding circumstances. If the femoral artery and vein have been divided, any attempt to preserve the limb will certainly prove fatal. Amputation at the hip-joint for gunshot wound is generally fatal; so fatal, indeed, that it ought only to be undertaken when the lower limb is so mutilated as to render it a necessity, or when the greatON GUNSHOT INJUKIES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 559 vessels have been injured. When any doubt exists as to the probability of saving the limb the operation should be postponed, and undertaken, if necessary, as a secondary amputation. The experience of all British and Continental surgeons fairly endorses Longmore’s conclusions, that in gunshot fractures of the thigh, while the propriety of practising conservatism in the upper third is clearly indicated, amputation is the safest practice in gunshot fractures of the middle and lower third. M. Legouest, in an essay published in the * Mem. of the Society of Surgeons at Paris/ believes that amputation at the hip-joint should be reserved for compound fractures complicated with injuries to the great vessels, and he advocates the postponement of the operation as long as possible. In gunshot fracture of the head of the femur, where the soft parts Gunshot are not greatly injured nor the bone comminuted, excision of the bone of may be performed, the only case of recovery in the American war from femur such an injury being where this practice was adopted. In Circular No. Ill two such successful cases are recorded out of three, and they in- duce Dr. Otis to “ add that these instances must place excision at the hip for gunshot injury amongst the established operations of surgery.” Out of eighty-seven excisions at the hip for injury in America, eight recovered. In fracture of the thigh the evil of transporting a patient is so Of thigh, great that Stromeyer says, “ I have, during the last campaign, lived to see what I expressed a desire for some years ago, when I wrote, ‘ Above all things it appears to me to be necessary that cases of gunshot frac- ture of the thigh should not be transported to a distance, but should be carried on a stretcher to the nearest house, and the treatment carried out there.’” He speaks most highly of the conservative treatment of all gunshot fractures. When operation is called for, pri- mary measures should always be preferred both for amputation and excision. In f racture of the leg, conservatism has even a better chance, that is, Of leg. where the shaft of the bone is alone implicated; for when the knee is involved, amputation is generally held to be the rule of treatment. Excision should not be entertained, the results of experience con- demning the attempt. Langenbeck in gunshot wounds of the knee Of knee- recommends conservative treatment; amputation being alone required when the soft parts are severely injured and the hones shattered. He lays, also, the greatest stress upon the necessity of fixing the limb in some immovable apparatus, from the moment of the injury to its cure (the plaster-of-Paris splint being preferred), coupled with the appli- cation of ice to the part. In gunshot fracture of the shaft of the leg hones not involving joints, the same rules of practice are applicable as have been laid down for the treatment of fracture of the humerus, &c. In gunshot wounds involving the ankle-joint, amputation is the Of ankle- best practice. In exceptional instances where the injury is slight j°hit. that is, where the bone is simply split into the joint, an attempt to save the limb may be justifiable. Excision, as a primary operation is not desirable; as a secondary oue, where an attempt to save the limb has been made and failed, Langenbeck’s experience is in favour of excision nine out of eleven cases in which he did it after the Bohemian warOn amputation in gunshot fracture.

MacCormac's views. 5G0 ON GUNSHOT INJURIES OP THE EXTREMITIES. having recovered ; but to obtain this result, he asserts that the complete immobility of the parts involved by means of the plaster-of-Paris splint or one of its congeners is indispensable. With respect to amputation in gunshot fractures, every surgeon since Guthrie’s time believes that the primary should, as arule.be preferred to the secondary. This primary amputation should also be performed as soon after the accident as possible. There is no necessity to wait for the effects of the shock of the accident to pass away, and unless the collapse be very severe, the hand of the surgeon need not be stayed. When, however, the collapse is great, some little delay had better be observed, for it is then more than probable that some internal injury or other complication exists to prevent reaction. Chloroform or any other anaesthetic may be used in military as freely as in civil practice. It has a powerful influence in preventing shock and allowing prolonged or double operations to be performed, which could not otherwise be undertaken, at least without extra risk. In military practice it should be remembered that a limb must often be sacrificed when in civil practice it might be saved; and that am- putation is often substituted for excision on account of the impossi- bility of giving the part the necessary amount of absolute rest and the patient the attention that can only be found in a civil hospital, “ for when active operations are proceeding, and it is necessary to carry the wounded to any distance, the advantage of early removal of shattered limbs is obvious, especially when means of rendering the limbs im- movable during the transport are defective or the transport itself has to be conducted over rough roads or in unsuitable vehicles, and the hopes of success from conservative treatment are thereby reduced almost to zero.”—Longmore. Dr. Gordon, the British commissioner accredited to the French army in the late war between France and Prussia, informs us that the conclu- sions the bulk of surgeons arrived at as regards amputation were, that it was more suited than excision or re-section when its subject had to be carried on with the army; that excision and resection were much more likely to be successful when practised in the upper than in the lower extremity; that excision of the knee, as a substitute for amputation in case of gunshot wounds of that articulation, has sadly failed ; that the practice of conservative surgery in stationary hospitals furnishes no criterion of its suitability in movable hospitals, its require- ments involving such attention from the surgeon as can alone be fully carried out when there are comparatively few cases of severity to attend to; and that in many cases, where the limbs are saved, they are relatively of little use. Mac Cormac urges that the mortality after primary is so very much smaller than that attendant on secondary amputation, that this point cannot be too strongly insisted upon.561 ANESTHETICS. CHAPTER XXXY. ANESTHETICS. When Sir H. Davy’s attention was drawn in 1798 to Priestley’s General nitrons oxide gas by Dr. Mitchell’s theory that this gas “ was the prin- remar^S- ciple of contagion, and capable of producing the most terrible effects when respired by animals in the minutest quantities, or even when applied to the skin or muscular fibre,” and when he with Southey, the then Poet Laureate, and Coleridge, the philosopher, inhaled it with sufficient frequency “ to establish the fact that the gas possesses an intoxicating quality, to which the enthusiasm of persons submitting to its operation has imparted a character of extravagance wholly incon- sistent with truth” (‘ Life of Davy,’ by Paris, 1831), he little thought that he was then laying the basis of experimental investigations that were to form an epoch in the history of the world or rather of mankind, and to end in the introduction into practice of a new power, which, being of inestimable value to the general public, is of nearly equal value to the medical profession, and has been the means of revolu- tionising surgery to an extent which few are aware of; for the “ most terrible effects” with which this gas was credited have been transformed into the beneficial effects brought about by anaesthetics. In the present work, I have neither space nor inclination to go fully into the history of the subject. To the works of Snow, Sir James Simpson, Sansom, Druitt, Holmes, Dr. Marion Sims, MM. Perrin and Lallemand, I must refer the reader for full particulars on this subject. I shall content myself by recording the fact, that Dr. Crawford W. Long, of Athens, Georgia, was the first surgeon who, in March, 1842, performed a surgical operation while the patient was completely anaesthetized by the inhalation of sulphuric ether. Dr. Marion Sims (‘ Virginia Medical Monthly,’ May, 1877), remarks “ That the honour of the first public and authentic trial of surgical anaesthesia, by the aid of means newly discovered, belongs to an entirely obscure dentist, Horace Wells, of Hartford, Connecticut” (M. Perrin), this dentist having employed Davy’s nitrous oxide gas in dentistry in 1844 Nitrous with an excellent result. In 1846, Morton, Wells’ late partner, intro- oxide, duced into practice at Massachusett’s Hospital the use of sulphuric ether, probably on the suggestion of Dr. Jackson. In 1847, our own Lawrence, of St. Bartholomew’s, on the suggestion of a student, Mr. Purnell, now Principal of Madras Medical College, used chloric ether for the same purpose (‘ Holmes’s Syst.,’ vol. 5, Ed. 2), and in the autumn of the same year, Sir James Simpson gave to the profession the active principle of the chloric of ether, the chloroform, on the sugges- Chloroform, tion of Mr. Waldie, of Liverpool, and since then this drug or ether, separately or combined, bas been in general use. Other anesthetics, however, have been introduced, the bichloride of Bichloride of methyline being the most popular. methyline. How anesthetics act upon the body is not yet determined, although Their action, it is tolerably certain that the ultimate result is absolute paralysis of vol. ii. 36ANESTHETICS. 562 Stages of anaesthesia. How anaesthetics destroy life. Cause of cessation of heart’B action prior to arrest of respiration. Respiration usually ceases first. Ether. Advantages and disad- vantages. Guides to complete anaesthesia. Post-mortem observations. the nerve centres, cerebral and spinal. To this end a patient passes through,first, a stage of cerebral excitement; next, cerebral insensi- bility and loss of sensation; thirdly, loss of voluntary motion; and, lastly, of reflex action, the brain losing its power before the spinal cord; absolute paralysis and anaesthesia existing only when both nerve centres are completely under the influence of the inhaled drug, the nerve supply of the respiratory and circulatory systems alone ex- cepted. Indeed, it is upon this fact that the practical value of all anaesthetics is based, the surgeon aiming at producing paralysis of the muscles of the trunk and extremities only, and not those of the respi- ratory or circulatory systems. In a general way, there is a wide interval between the two stages; in exceptional instances this interval is abridged; in such the heavt and respiratory system suddenly become affected, and it is under these circumstances that sudden death takes place. Chloroform, like many other drugs, does not act alike in all in- dividuals, some being very susceptible to its influence whilst others are the reverse. Like all anaesthetics, it increases at first the force of the heart’s action, although this effect is slight and transient, the heart acting with less than its natural force when complete anaesthesia is produced. When a patient is brought quickly under the influence of an anaesthetic the heart’s action may be suddenly arrested, Brown- Sequard believing that under such circumstances “ it is by the reflex influence due to the sudden irritation of the branches of the par vagura in the lungs that chloroform has killed in the very rare cases in which the heart’s action had been stopped before the respiration.” (‘ Lect. on Phys. of Nerv. System.’) Moderate doses of chloroform tend to weaken the heart’s action after their first stimulating effects have passed away, the respiratory act usually ceasing before the circulatory when death is the result. Thus danger increases with the degree of stupor produced. Ether is said not to depress the action of the heart to the same extent as choloroform. Of late it has grown rapidly into favour, and it is said by its advocates to be more safe than any other anaesthetic.. It should be given with sufficient freedom to bring the patient under its influence before the blood becomes saturated. When the upper eyelid can be raised without muscular resistance: and no muscular contraction is caused by touching the cornea, the patient is, as a rule, sufficiently under the influence of the anaesthetic, for surgical purposes. Respiration generally, but not invariably ceases before the action of the heart, and death may be due either to the failure of the heart’s- action or to that of the respiratory function. After death, all the cavities of the heart are distended; the cases in which the left side is empty being only exceptional. Chloroform is more commonly fatal in the struggling stage than in any other. Billroth asserts “ that during the stage of excitement violent mus- cular efforts may give rise to apoplexy, especially in individuals with disease of the heart, rigid arteries, or emphysema. Of most consequence in this stage, however, are the contractions of the muscles of masti- cation and the posterior muscles of the tongue. By means of the stylo-glossi and the glosso-pharyngei the tongue is drawn spasmodically backwards, pressing the epiglottis down so as to close mecnanically the . S. s563 ANAESTHETICS. aperture of the larynx. Such patients become blue in the face, and die suffocated, not through the direct action of the chloroform, but from the mechanical privation of air,” unless the tongue be well drawn forwards, or chin tilted upwards. Anaesthetics affect the brain of different people in as many ways as drunkenness. One will he quarrelsome, a second violent, a third sen- timental, and others maudlin, melancholic, or merry. In epileptic subjects, 1 have seen patients pass through some epileptic convulsions during their progress towards narcosis. The best rules for the administration of chloroform, ether, or any anaesthetic are those given by the Chloroform Committee of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London, 1864. It was my privilege to act as one of the members of that body, and all my subsequent experience has convinced me of the value of the suggestions then laid down. I quote them in full with only a few modifications. Rules relating to the Administration of Chloroform, or other Anaesthetics. Chloroform should on no account he given carelessly or by the Rules for inexperienced; and, when complete insensibility is desired, the attention adnunistra- of its administrator should be exclusively confined to the duty he has Esthetic undertaken. Under no circumstances is it desirable for a person to give chloro- form to himself. It is not advisable to give an anesthetic after a long fast, or soon As to food, after a meal, the best time for its administration being four or five hours after food has been taken. If the patient is much depressed, there is no objection to his taking Depression, a small quantity of brandy, wine, or ammonia, before commencing the inhalation.

The recumbent position of the patient is preferable; the prone posi- Position, tion is inconvenient to the administrator, but entails no extra danger. In the erect or sitting posture, there is danger from syncope. Sudden elevation or turning of the body should he avoided. An apparatus is not essential to safety if due care be taken in giving inhaler, the anmsthetic. Free admixture of air with the anaesthetic is of the first importance; and, guaranteeing this, any apparatus may be em- ployed. If lint, or a handkerchief, or a napkin is used, it should he folded as an open cone, or held an inch or an inch and a half from the face. Chloroform should invariably be given slowly. Sudden increase of To be given the strength of the anaesthetic is most dangerous. Three and a half slov'1y- per cent, is the average amount, and per cent., with 95£ of atmo- spheric air, is the maximum of the anaesthetic which can he required; given cautiously at first, the quantity within this limit being slowly increased according to the necessities of the case, the administrator being guided more by its effect on the patient than by the amount exhibited. Ether may be given more boldly. The administrator should watch the respiration of his patient and must keep one hand free for careful observation of the pulse.ANAESTHETICS. 561. Vomiting. Danger signals. Their treatment. Fresh air. Inversion of body. Artificial respiration. Galvanism. Laryngo- tomy. Chloroform or A. C. E. mixture. The patient who appears likely to vomit whilst beginning to inhale the anaesthetic must be at once brought fully under its influence, the tendency to sickness will then cease. The occurrence, during the administration of an anesthetic, of sudden pallor, lividity of the patient’s countenance, or sudden failure or flicker- ing of the pulse, or feeble or shallow respirations, indicates danger, and necessitates immediate withdrawal of the anesthetic until such symptoms have disappeared. On the occurrence of these symptoms, and especially if they should become so urgent as to threaten death from failure of respiration, of the heart’s action, or of both together, the following rules of treatment should be observed: Allow free access of fresh air, pull forward the lower jaw and possibly the tongue, and clear the mouth and fauces, keep or place the patient recumbent, dash cold water on the face and chest, and aid the re- spiratory movements by rhythmical compression of the thorax. Nelaton and Marion Sims advise the inversion of the body with the view of throwing what blood there is wholly to the brain, on the theory that death from chloroform is, as a rule, due to syncope, or to cerebral anaemia. In the more threatening cases, commence instantly with artificial respiration, whether the respiration has failed alone or the pulse and the respiration together. Galvanism may be used in addi- tion to artificial respiration, but artificial respiration is on no account to be delayed or suspended in order that galvanism may be tried. In extreme cases laryngo tomy may be required. Few, if any, are insusceptible to the influence of anaesthetics, from two to ten minutes being required to induce anaesthesia. The time varies according to age, temperament, and habits. The mixture of alcohol 1 part, chloroform 2 parts, and ether 3 parts, should be given in the same way as chloroform alone, care being taken, when lint or a handkerchief is used, to prevent the too free escape of the vapour. I think highly of this mixture. Morbus cordis no great bar to its exhibition. Phthisis no bar. As to its employment in ophthalmic operations. Use of anaesthetics in surgical operations. With heart disease they may be given in any case which requires an operation, though when there is evidence of a fatty, weak, or dilated heart great caution is demanded. Ether is probably under these circuin- tances, the better vapour to employ. Valvular disease is of less importance. In phthisis, when an operation is unavoidable, anaesthetics may be given with impunity. For all operations upon the jaws and teeth, the lips, cheeks, and tongue, anaesthetics may be inhaled with ordinary safety. By care and good management, the patient may be kept under their influence to the completion of the operation. In these cases blood, as it escapes, if not voided by the mouth, passes into the pharynx. If any small quantity finds its way through the larynx, it is readily expelled by coughing. In operations upou the soft palate, fauces, pharynx, and posterior nares, if sudden or severe haemorrhage is likely to occur, it is not advisable to induce deep insensibility. In cases requiring laryn- gotomy and tracheotomy, anaesthetics may be employed with safety and advantage. For operations upon the eye, involving the contents of the globe, theANAESTHETICS. 565 use of anaesthetics is open to objection, on account of the damage which the eye may sustain from muscular straining or vomiting. If em- ployed, profound insensibility should he induced. Recent experience tends rather to prove, that anaesthetics may be used without fear in most eye operations. In operations for hernia, and in the application of the taxis, anaes- thetics act most beneficially. For most operations about the anus and perinaeum, profound anaesthesia is positively demanded. In the condition of shock or of great depression as after haemor- jn shock. rhage, the careful administration of anaesthetics diminishes the risk of an operation. „ In all cases other than those specially referred to, it is sufficient to state, so far as a mere surgical operation is concerned, that anaesthetics may invariably be administered. The continuous vomiting occasionally induced by and following upon, the inhalation of anaesthetics, may be injurious by consequent exhaus- tion, as well as by mechanically disturbing the repair of a wound. With this reservation, they do not appear to interfere with the recovery of patients from surgical operations. Statistics,—The results of 2586 capital operations performed before, Statistics, and of 1847 performed since, the introduction of anaesthetics, which I collected from all authentic available sources show' that the rate of mortality has not been increased, even though much graver operations have been done under the influence of anaesthetics. The risk attending Risk, the inhalation of chloroform is very small, being about 1 in 3000 administrations. This is enough to forbid its use in trivial cases, but not enough to do so in cases of capital operation, or where for purposes of diagnosis it is required. In children it is very safe. The best common instrument for the administration of chloroform is Inhaler, that employed at Guy’s, which 1 introduced in 1864, having had it made after a pattern suggested by Dr. Parker, late of the Loudon Hospital. It is not complicated by any valves, but is merely a mouth and nose-piece lined with lint, with openings to admit air freely (Fig. 606). Within Fig. 606. Fig. 607. Chloroform inhaler.

Clover’s apparatus is, however, very good when it can be ob- tained. It is composed of an india-rubber bag into which chloroform or any other anaesthetic is pumped, mixed with atmospheric air. Clover employs 3 or 4 per cent, of chloroform. It is, however, a cumbersome apparatus, and cannot be at universal command. When he gives nitrous oxide gas at first and follows it up by ether, his apparatus is equally satisfactory. For ether or the anaesthetic A. C. E. mixture the leather bottle-shaped apparatus, as suggested by Dr. Golding Bird, or the one figured above as made for Mr. Rendle and improved by Morris (Fig. 607) is very valuable. The bichloride of methyline is recommended to our notice as an anaesthetic of great power. Patients are said to be brought under the influence of the drug in twenty or thirty seconds, and to recover from it rapidly with little inconvenience. No sickness or headache is said to follow its use, unless the inhalation has been continued for many minutes, or a second dose is given to keep up the effect. Of course, if the inhalation be prolonged, the after-effects resemble, though in a less degree, those of chloroform, save the one—absence of muscular excitement. “ The rapidity of action of the drug and recovery appears,” writes Rendle, “ to be due to the great volatility and solubility, enabling a large quantity to reach and escape from the nerve organs at once; its safety, to its rather stimulant action on the heart, and its rapid elimination.” The bichloride being very volatile, requires to be kept in a well-stoppered bottle•, and it is an advantage to keep it in the dark, inverted under water. Mr. Rendle claims for its use the following advantages:—The patients retain their normal colour and appearance,- the anaesthesia is good, is rapidly induced, and can be maintained for any length of time; the recovery is rapid and complete ; there is no unpleasant after- symptoms, nor muscular rigidity. He says it is also at least as safe as chloroform. At Guy’s Hospital, it is in common use for eye surgery, where a few minutes are only required for the anaesthesia, but in the wards generally chloroform or ether is the favourite. In abdominal surgery, such as ovariotomy, Keith has said that ethe is less prone to be followed by sickness than chloroform, and, if the success of an operation is any argument in its favour, Keith’s must be quoted. I have for some years employed the mixture recommended by the Chloroform Committee—of Alcohol, Chloroform, and Ether— and think well of it. I believe it to be as good as chloroform, and less likely than any other to be followed by that bane of all anaesthetics, vomiting. In the operations of dentistry and all short measures, the nitrous oxide gas is of great value. After the use of any anaesthetic, everything should be given cold for twelve or twenty-four hours to prevent sickness j ice, indeed, may be sucked with advantage; and ice and milk is a very favourite mixture, If hot food be given, vomiting is far more likely to appear, or to be aggravated. Anaesthetics, however, have other uses than the destruction of pain. As aids to diagnosis they are of priceless value, both to the physician and surgeon. To the surgeon they have also opened up new fields for his scientific art which were formerly but little known. I shall point567 ANAESTHETICS. them out, however, but briefly, quoting from a lecture I had the honour of delivering at the Hunterian Society in 1870:— “ Chloroform as an aid to diagnosis stands second to no means which we have at our disposal. To the physician who has a difficult case of abdominal tumour, what facilities it gives him for its thorough jn investigation. Suspected tumours become phantoms ; so-called abdominal movable kidneys slide away; and indefinite conditions become clear tumours, and intelligible. With how much greater certainty a physician can think over a doubtful case, decide upon its nature, deliver his opinion, and treat it when he has adopted this means of investigation. In hysterical subjects, it renders a thorough abdominal examination a possibility, when no such previously existed; and in what class of cases, may I ask, is it more necessary to make a positive diagnosis than in this ? In my own practice, it enabled me on one occasion to make out a pregnancy when an ovarian tumour had been diagnosed by men whose authority was undoubted, and in a patient whose position in life rendered the suspicion of pregnancy almost a libel. Indeed the ovarian nature of the disease was looked upon as so decided, that my aid was sought solely for the operation. In this case an examination of the abdomen was impossible, from hysterical sensibility ; but under chloroform, all difficulties disappeared. To the physician-accoucheur may I not also assert it to be equally valuable for diagnostic purposes ? To answer this fully is out of my province; but 1 have known a case of cystic disease of the uterus, which was about to be operated upon as an ovarian tumour, made out by the use of the uterine sound, with the patient under chloroform, when an examination by the same instru- ment made before had failed to yield any such evidence. In the In children, surgical diseases of children is it possible to over-estimate its value ? With what gentleness can difficult examiuatious be now made of in- jured limbs; and with what certainty can we now apply our treat- ment ! In sounding for stone what facilities it affords ! In general surgery, what new fields has it not opened ? Where would ovariotomy have now been, may I ask, had not chloroform been in use ? Would it have been an established operation in surgery? Could it have been so successful ? The answers to these questions, I think are plain ; they must be in the negative. It is true the operation had been performed before its introduction ; it had been successful in a few cases, but it had almost fallen out of practice; its revival was due, without doubt, to chloroform, and its present established position to the general use of that drug. No operation requires more gentleness and nicety; and how could these essential points of practice be applied with a patient writhing under the agonies of an abdominal section ? To all abdominal surgery the same observations are applicable, although they may not tell, perhaps, with the same force. “ Let us now refer to another class of cases; to that large one in pl»8tic known as belonging to plastic surgery. How many cases of vesico- surgery, or recto-vaginal fistula were successfully treated by operation before chloroform was introduced ? At Guy’s Hospital I can find no record of such. The physician-accoucheur used to cauterise the margins of the fistula, it is true, but, I fear, with poor success; for I have never heard of a case of any size being so cured. At the present day these cases are now to be cured by operation with as much certainty as any other class. They have in truth been568 ANESTHETICS. moved from the incurable to curable affections. And yet these in- stances of plastic surgery are only a portion of those which I might enumerate. “ In the treatment of deformities about the mouth, nose, and eye; in the division of cicatrices after burns; in the treatment of rup- tured perinmum, with all its complications—what innumerable cases might be quoted new, against the few of former times ! In bone . “Again: in the operations of bones and joints, how many of the operations, improvements in our practice are there that may not be put down to the use of chloroform ?—operations for necrosis in particular. How rare these were, and how unsatisfactory they must have been before its introduction! I can recall a few which i saw in my student’s days with no pleasant feeling. How common they are now, and how succesful! Taking Guy’s as a type of the metropolitan hospitals, an operation for necrosis can always be found for operating days—the operation is so frequent and so satisfactory. In the removal of bone from joints, in the excision of joints, it is only fair to believe that a great part of the success which now attends the practice is to be attributed to the use of an anajsthetic ? How many hands and feet, which would formerly have been sacrificed, are now saved by the removal of diseased bone, it is difficult to estimate. Would Sir W. Fergusson have framed the phrase ‘conservative surgery,’ and could it have been adopted, before the introduction of chloroform ? In aneurisms. “ In the treatment of aneurisms, have not like improvements to be recorded P Has not chloroform rendered possible the cure of aneurism by pressure ? Has it not also rendered the practice of torsion of arteries for the arrest of haemorrhage a practical suc- cess, thus simplifying surgery ? How many cases of strangulated Strangulated hernia are now reduced, which in former times would have been sub- mitted to strange treatment and to a delayed operation ? How simple Dislocations, it has comparatively rendered the reduction of recent dislocations! Where are now the pulleys, the ropes, and the other frightful mecha- nical appliances, that were used of old for the reduction of dislocations of the hip, shoulder, and other joints ? Are they not decaying in the lumber-rooms of our hospitals ? and has not the use of chloroform made the reduction of dislocations by manipulation a reality ? On one occasion I reduced with ease, by manipulation, a dislocation of the elbow-joint backwards, complicated with fracture of the humerus, which would probably have been left unreduced before the introduction of the anaesthetic, and more recently the head of the humerus dislocated on to the dorsum of the scapula, complicated with fracture through the tuberosities. “ Let us contrast for one moment the operation of perineal section for stricture as it was and as now performed. Do we not all remember it as one of the most unsatisfactory and unsuccessful of surgical opera- tions ? Do not we know it to be one of the most satisfactory and successful ? Indeed I might continue the contrast between the pre-anass- thetic period and the present; but I think I have said enough to show that to the introduction of chloroform many of our best improvements in surgical practice are to be attributed. For the surgeon it does away with all excuse, if any ever existed, for hurry in an operation. He can take his steps in it with deliberation, and make it a certainty.

The use of anaesthetics has rendered the practice of surgery safer, surer, and more scientific. It has removed difficulties from the practice of our art which before were insurmountable, and has rendered possible innumerable things that could not in former times have been entertained.” Local anaethesia may be brought about by freezing a part, as sug- Local gested by Ur. J. Arnott, or by means of the rapid evaporisation of pure anaesthesia, anhydrous ether, as practised by Dr. B. W. Richardson. Both are valuable means of diminishing pain where anaesthesia by inhalation is forbidden or inapplicable. Aruott’s plan is carried out by mixing Arnott’s up finely pounded ice in a gauze net or thin translucent india- method, rubber bag, with half its bulk of powdered salt, the net being placed over the part to be benumbed. If well applied, it renders the skin at once pale and bloodless, and if continued, of a tallowy death-like aspect; when too long applied it may produce frost-bite or chilblain. Dr. Richardson’s ether spray is a more elegant, as it is a more Richardson’s, effectual, mode of applying local anaesthesia than ice. It is worked by his well-known apparatus, consisting of a tube with india-rubber ball and second spring ball to make the current continuous, the air being pumped in through this tube into a bottle containing anhydrous ether of a sp. gr. 0‘723 and of a boiling-point of 96° Fahr. Through the stoppered neck of this bottle a glass tube is passed, which reaches at one end nearly to the bottom of the bottle, and at the other, is fitted with a point, with one or more perforations through which the ether is forced in a fine spray, this spray being directed upon the part to be benumbed (Fig. 608).

For opening abscesses, taking out small tumours, the removal of Where external piles, and other miuor operations, this local anaesthesia is of applicable, great value; but in graver surgical acts, it is inapplicable, as it only affects the surface and is but skin-deep in its influence.570 AMPUTATION. General remarks. Its history. Circular amputation. CHAPTER XXXYI. AMPUTATION. When a limb is saved by the excision of a joint, and life prolonged by the application of a ligature to, or the torsion of a wounded or dis- eased artery, surgical science claims a triumph; and surely an equal triumph ought to be accorded to her, when, by the removal of a part that interferes with its duties, life is rendered more valuable; or by the amputation of a limb that is irreparably injured, or diseased, death is averted. To say that amputation is an opprobrium of our art is to take a narrow view of its objects, since as the first object of the surgeon is to save life, the necessary sacrifice of a limb becomes the truest “ con- servatism.” To sacrifice a limb unnecessarily is an error which the sur- gical mind would never willingly commit, although to sacrifice life in the feeble effort to save a limb is one of far greater magnitude. It is an error, however, that timid surgeons are too likely to fall into when inoculated with the narrow views of a spurious conservatism, since to leave a limb alone with the hope of saving it is a passive act of the pro- fessional mind that requires no effort; while to make up the mind to act requires courage, backed up with knowledge and a full sense of responsibility. The operation of amputation itself requires nicety and well-applied mechanical skill; but to determine upon its necessity or otherwise requires a high order of knowledge, a careful balancing of probabilities, and much decision. It is not my intention to discuss, in the present chapter, the con- ditions under which amputation may be called for, since these have been fully considered in the different chapters devoted to such injuries and diseases as may require this treatment. I propose simply to consider amputation as an operation, to point out the best modes of its per- formance under the different conditions in which it may be demanded, and to describe the various forms of operation as applicable to different parts. To supply the history of amputation would be an interesting but a too extended process. In 1 Cooper’s Surgical Dictionary ’ and ‘ Holmes’s System’ two able articles will be found upon the subject which contain all that can be desired. For the present purpose it will be enough to state that the first amputations were performed by the circular method, the soft parts being divided down to the bone by a circular sweep of the knife {vide Celsus), the haemorrhage being arrested by the red-hot iron, and the bone divided by a saw. About 1718 J. L. Petit, tbe French surgeon, who improved the tour- niquet now known by bis name, as well as our own great surgeon, Ches- elden, suggested that the skin and fat of the limb to be removed, should pe first cut through and retracted, and then the muscles and bones bivided as high as they were exposed. Still later, Louis, of Paris,AMPUTATION. 571 adopted the practice of dividing by the first cut the skin and super- By double fioinl layer of muscles, by the second, the deeper muscles down to the mci31on- bone, at the line of the retracted superficial layer, and lastly, the hone itself. He also used a retractor. In 1779, Alanson, of Liverpool, made a still farther advance by Circular skin, cutting the integument as usual and allowing it to retract, and then ( f dividing the muscles obliquely upwards, cutting from without down to Muscles, the bone, more after the modern flap operation, the hone being subse- quently divided. The soft parts in this operation on being brought down formed a conical cavity with the bone at the apex, Alanson’s object having been to prevent the sugar-loaf stump. Still later, Ben- jamin Bell, of Edinburgh, and Hey, of Leeds, secured the same end by first dividing the integument with a circular cut and dissecting it up j then the muscles at a higher level; and, lastly, the bone, this being divided at a point considerably above the line of the retracted muscles. Hey, moreover, in the thigh amputations suggested the expediency of dividing the posterior muscles longer than the anterior, to compensate for their greater retraction. The flap operation is more modern than the circular, and to Mr. Flap James Young, of Plymouth, is due the credit of having first published in °PL'ration- 1678, the method which he informs us he had “ from a very ingenious brother of ours,” Mr. C. Lowdham, of Exeter. He made one flap only of skin, divided the muscles by the circular plan, and stitched the parts Skin flap, together. Eighteen years later Verduin, of Amsterdam, made the first Skill aml muscular and skin flap by perforating the limb and cutting outwards muscular (transfixion). flap by To Liston, must be attributed the credit of having fully established trimsfixion- the flap operation, and in the pre-anmsthetic period when time was a point of consideration, the expedition with which amputation could he performed by transfixion compared with the tediousness of the circular operation tended much towards this end. It was thought, moreover, that a large mass of muscle formed a good covering to the bone, and yielded a better stump than that in the circular. Experience, soon proved, however, that this opinion was not supported by facts, that the supposed advantages were not real, and did not compensate for the larger extent of wound caused by the flap operation, and for the evil of often having to tuck in the projecting ends of the divided muscles before the integuments could he adjusted. Liston saw this Amputation before he died, and was led with Syme to modify his operation, makino- by skin flaps in muscular subjects two lateral crescentic skin flaps with their con” aml circular vexity downwards, and dividing the muscles as in the circular method. mUSC e3‘ This operation is by far the best for all amputations of the leg and forearm. In more modern times, Lowdham and Young’s practice has found expression in Carden’s operation, while Teale’s amputation must be regarded as a modification of the flap. Both these gentlemen, how- ever, advocated the long anterior flap in preference to all others, Lon-anterior Teale making two rectangular flaps of unequal length of skin and flap” muscle (Fig. 614), and Carden, a rounded anterior flap of skin alone (Fig. 615); and under certain conditions, nothing can be better than the results obtained, the line of cicatrix being posterior to the ex- tremity of the stump and out of harm’s way, thereby allowing the patient to rest part, if not all, his weight upon the stump.572 AMPUTATION. The chief objections to the operation consist in the tendency there is for a long skin flap to slough, and the necessity of dividing the hone at a higher level than would be required in the circular operation, when a long flap cannot otherwise be made. In muscular subjects this last objection is serious, and fatal to the operation in many thigh amputations ; for it is a truth that cannot be too forcibly recognised, that in the thigh, the danger to life is increased with every inch of bone removed. The surgeon who invariably practises Teale’s ampu- tation will often sacrifice a large portion of a limb that might other- wise be saved, and have to amputate at a higher point than the necessities of the case demand, thereby often adding to the danger of the case as well as performing a needless and unjustifiable operation. The surgeon who removes such portions of the body as require removal and no more, by such a flap as allows the cicatrix to be placed behind the stump and out of harm’s way, performs a good and scientific operation. Under all circumstances, any form of amputation must be looked upon with favour that takes away only what needs removal, and provides sufficient integument to cover the end of the stump; that ensures the cicatrix being out of harm’s way, and that no nerves are likely to be involved in the cicatrix or fixed to the end of the amputated bone. Any form of amputation must be regarded with disfavour that requires the removal of more of the body than is essential to carry out the surgeon’s primary aim, and increases the risk of the operation, how- Sacrifice flaps ever g00(j may he the stump secured. To provide sufficient inteffu- amputate nient to cover the stump is a wise and necessary measure, and higher than to fail in this when circumstances do not compel must be regarded as necessary. had surgery; yet in certain cases of injury, disease, or gangrene of the extremities, where it is advisable to take away the diseased or injured parts, and no sound skin is left from which to make a flap, amputation should be performed without regard to a covering for the stump, as doubtless, it is better to remove the diseased part that is hastening on the end and leave the stump to granulate, than allow the disease to have its way and to sacrifice life. At the hip- and shoulder- joints where this contingency is most likely to occur, the adoption of this practice is not rarely called for, and at other parts is equally appli- cable ; for, knowing what good stumps are often obtained when the skin and soft parts, that at the time of the operation covered in the bone, subsequently sloughed, I am convinced that in certain injuries to the arm and leg the surgeon had better amputate with a poor flap at the elbow- or knee-joints, leaving the rest to nature, than risk life by amputating higher up, i. e. through the shafts of the humerus or femur. I have on many occasions acted on this principle, and to pre- vent the necessity of amputating above a joint in order to make a good stump with a skin covering, amputated at a joint or below, utilising even injured skin or bruised tissues, and rarely have been disappointed in the result, the stump subsequently granulating well, even when the flaps themselves sloughed. In injuries to the leg this point is of great importance, since the mortality of amputation Example of the thigh for injuries is very great. As an admirable illustration of tbe value of this practice a case may be referred to (Circ. No. iii, Washington Army Depart., page 216) in which recovery ensued after all four limbs of a man mt. 26 were amputated on account Objections to the operation. Requisites lor a good operation.AMPUTATION. 573 of frost-bite. A month after the injury, when the line of demarca- tion had exposed the bones, Dr. Muller, in order to save loss of blood which would have been serious in the patient’s weak condition, dis- sected as much healthy flesh from the radius and ulna as the line of demarcation would admit, without cutting any blood-vessels, and then sawed through the bone. This operation was performed on both arms with hardly the loss of any blood. On the third day both legs were amputated in the same manner. In this case not one of the four stumps could be covered with sufficient skin, and much had to be left to self- reparation which took place to an extraordinary extent, the stumps healing over with healthy granulations, some little exfoliation of bone taking place in two. Again, is it always necessary to amputate through healthy tis- Not sues ? or, to gain this end, is it expedient to amputate higher up than necessary to would otherwise be necessary ? I unhesitatingly answer that such !J]™r^“gale practice is not called for. To amputate through tissues infiltrated through with cancer or other new growths, would, of course, be futile and healthy bad surgery; but to cut through tissues that are merely infiltrated tlssue- with inflammatory products, that are pathologically reparable and of use, is a wise and conservative process. In disease of the knee- joint when suppuration has spread up the thigh into the soft parts, amputation may often be performed through the condyles or just above them, and a good stump secured; when by following another practice, a much higher amputation would be called for, and conse- quently, increased risk to life incurred. Tissues infiltrated with in- flammatory lymph often unite rapidly and well; indeed I have seen Union of “ brawny flaps” unite by primary union quite as well as others not brawny flaps, so infiltrated. I am convinced, too, that however desirable it may be to obtain good, long, and healthy flaps in all amputations, the advantages of such are not so great as to justify the surgeon in sacrificing more of the body than is essential, thereby adding to the risks of the case and more particularly in amputating above a joint. It is true, that Character of by one form of amputation, a better stump under most favorable cir- stumps, cumstances is often secured than another; but it is equally true, that good stumps are often obtained under the most unfavorable conditions, and that bad stumps follow the amputation of a limb in which the state of the flaps promised to bring about a favorable result. To assert that Relative the form of amputation, or rather that the shape of the flaps, &c., has mortality of anything to do with the relative mortality of different amputations is dj,fer!;n[- incorrect. What evidence exists, points to a different conclusion, for a" PU '* lon9‘ the success of an amputation as of any other operation, turns more Effects of a upon what in recent times seem to have been forgotten, viz. the condi- gross tions of the viscera, the age, and general state of the subject, accepting mortal‘ty- the facts that the older the patient the greater the danger, and the more of the body that is removed, the greater the risk. My own conviction is, that however desirable it may be to obtain a model stump, the end is not N sufficiently certain or important to justify the surgeon in adding one ofMrts'to-6 tittle to the risk of the operation, or in sacrificing more of the limb sake of than the necessities of the case demand. I regard it as bad and un- stumP- justifiable surgery to perform a Syme or a Pirogoff’s amputation when a Chopart’s will suffice; to amputate a leg when the removal of a foot at the joint will answer the purpose; to remove a leg or thigh anAMPUTATION. 574 I Mortality determined l by age.

Amputation for acute suppuration very fatal. inch higher than is absolutely called for, in order to execute what may be looked upon as a good operation or to gratify a fancy; to ampu- tate through the condyles of the femur when an amputation at the knee-joint can be performed, or through the shaft of the femur when the like end may be secured by cutting through the condyles. The surgeon must ever look upon the operation of amputation as an unfortunate necessity, and should bear in mind that it is to be under- taken only to save or to prolong life, or to add to life’s usefulness. With these ends in view, he should not add one jot to its dangers, or take away an inch more of the body than is essential. The beauty of a stump may be something in itself, but is nothing if it is to be ob- tained by increased danger, and the brilliancy of an operation is a snare that should never be allowed to draw the surgeon avvay from the main object—the preservation of life—which alone gives the operation of amputation a high and scientific position in surgical practice. The mortality of amputation is more determined by age than any- thing else, and the credit of having statistically proved this fact is due to Mr. Holmes (c St. George’s Hosp. Rep.,’ 1866 and 1877). In my own paper on the causes of death in amputation (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xlii, 1859) this point was overlooked; but, following Mr. Holmes’s example, I re-analysed the cases on which it was based, and have been somewhat startled at the very definite conclusions brought out by my analysis. Thus— Out of 103 cases under 20 years of age, 10 died, or 1 in 10. Out of 111 cases between 21 and 40 years of age, 21 died, or 1 in 5. Out of 74 cases over 40 years of age, 22 died, or 1 in 3J. The mortality of amputation between the ages of 20 and 40 being exactly twice as great as before 20 years of age. Mr. Callender (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ vol. xlvii, 1864) and Mr. Holmes’s combined statistics reveal the same results: Cases under 20 years of age. Callender’s . 61 cases, 3 died Holmes’s . 130 „ 22 „ Between 20 and 40 years of age. 92 cases, 20 died 215 „ 68 „ Over 40 years of age. 74 cases, 30 died. 155 „ 68 „ 191 cases, 26 died, or 1 in 7$. 307 cases, 88 died, or 1 in 3^. 229 cases, 98 died, or 1 in 2J. Fifty-two deaths having occurred in 250 cases reported by Mr. Holmes in subjects under 30 years of age, and 106 deaths in 250 cases operated upon after 30 years of age. If the causes of amputation are looked at in the same light, the results become still more marked, for, dividing them into amputa- tions for disease, accident, and expediency, the latter term including amputations for tumours, deformity, &c., the following facts are elicited : Under 20 years of age Between 20 and 40 .

Amputations for acute suppurative disease are most fatal, and shouldAMPUTATION. 575 only be undertaken when a strong necessity exists. I pointed this out in 1859, but it is not a fact sufficiently recognised. _ Amputation in young life for chronic disease is most successful, being three times more so than at a later period, one only in every seventeen dying; amputation for accident increases in fatality with age; and amputations of expediency are as dangerous at all periods of life as traumatic amputations are in the aged. Mr. Callender has also well shown (‘ St. Barth. Hosp. Rep.,’ 1869) that the mortality of amputations is much alike, whether performed in country hospitals, in country private practice, or in country cases in London. In amputations on London subjects, as in the subjects of all large towns, the mortality is somewhat higher. Dr. Steele has, however, gone further, and proved by figures, that amputations performed in London for injury on country patients are, as a rule, more favorable than when performed in town cases, the difference between the two classes being far less marked in amputation for disease than for injury (* Guy’s Hosp. Rep.,’ 1869-70). The causes of death after amputation are as follows, taking these conclusions from my paper on the subject (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1859), to which the reader must be referred for further detail. Shock and exhaustion claim one third of the fatal cases, and one twelfth of all amputations. Pyaemia was the cause of death in 42 per cent, of the fatal cases, and in one tenth of all amputations. Secondary haemorrhage in 7 per cent, of the fatal cases, or 1£ per cent, of the whole number. Some complication, cerebral, thoracic or abdo- minal, causes death in about 4 per cent, of all cases. Pyaemia is nearly twice as fatal after amputations of expediency as after those for disease or primary amputations, but is less fatal after secondary amputations than any others. In amputation of the leg it is twice as destructive as in that of the thigh, the larger section of bone being the more danger- ous. In primary amputation of the leg, it is more fatal than when performed for disease. How far the deaths from secondary haemorrhage will be diminished when the practice of torsion of arteries is more general remains to be proved, although from the experience we have had at Guy’s Hospital the promise of a better result is very great. Up to the end of 1874 we have had 200 consecutive cases of amputations of the thigh, leg, arm, and forearm, in which all the arteries had been twisted (110 of them having heen of the femoral artery), and no case of secondary hannorrhage—indeed, our house-surgeons never expect to be called to cases of secondary htemorrhage now that torsion is the general practice of the hospital. The operation of amputation may be called for on account of some incurable disease or incurable injury. When performed for the first cause, the operation has been described as a pathological ampu- tation, when for the second, traumatic. Both classes are also subdivided, the pathological into amputations for suppurative disease of bones and joints—pure pathological amputation; and into those for talipes, tumours, deformities, &c.—amputations of expediency. Traumatic amputations performed during the first twenty-four hours after the accident before any inflammatory complications have set in, are called primary; the term secondary is applied to the same For chronic disease in children most successful.

Advantages of transfixion. class of cases after suppuration has appeared; the word intermediate being employed to designate amputations performed twenty-four hours after the accident, but before suppuration has declared itself. This distinction, however, is not a satisfactory one. Some statisticians have classed the secondary amputations with the pathological, but this practice is clearly wrong. The different Modes of Amputation maybe divided into three great classes—1st, the circular; 2nd, the flap operation, whether by transfixion or cutting from without in- wards—Teale’s amputation (consisting of one long anterior skin and muscular flap, and short posterior), being looked upon as a modification of the ordinary flap operation ; 3rd, the mixed form of amputation— skin flap, and circular cut through muscles—Carden’s operation being included in this series. Into one or other of these classes almost every form of amputation may be brought, although practically there are innumerable modifications of each, more particularly of the flap. The old circular, as already described (p. 570), is now fairly aban- doned. It has no advantages over the more modern mixed form of ampu- tation, and will not take the place of the flap where the latter is appli- cable. In small limbs, where there is but little muscular tissue and a single bone to divide, it may be performed, but cannot be recommended. It is more practised abroad than in this country. The flap operation doubtless owes its popularity as much to Liston, Lisfranc, and Velpeau, who were its strong supporters, as to the facility with which it is performed, and the satisfactory appearance of the flaps at the time of the operation. Before anaesthetics were introduced, ex- pedition was of importance, and it was the surgeon’s aim to remove a limb as rapidly as possible. “ The surgeon operating by the watch took off a limb by the flap operation in as many seconds as there were minutes occupied in the old circular method.”—Sir W. Fergusson. Since 1846, however, when anaesthesia came into vogue, this necessity has ceased to exist, and surgeons have been led away more from the flap operation to what may now be described as the mixed. In certain parts, however, the flap operation still holds its ground, and, in a general sense it may be said, that in operations where the shafts of single bones or some joints are involved, it is the best method; while in some localities, as at the shoulder- and hip-joints, it is the only one open to the surgeon. The objections to the flap operation are the large surface that is ex- posed, the danger of puncturing or slitting the main artery of the part, the inconvenience of bleeding, the leaving of the main artery and nerves in one of the flaps, and the disadvantage of a thick muscular flap. The flap amputation has, however, one great advantage, and that is, its capability of innumerable modifications. Thus, both flaps may be made by transfixing—the old plan; both may be made by cutting from with- out inwards; one flap, the anterior, may be made by the latter method, and the second or posterior, by transfixion; or lateral flaps, single or double, or oval flaps, may be made. The advantages of transfixing the flap consist in the rapidity and cleanliness with which the section of the muscles and deeper parts is made; its disadvantages, in the irregularity with which the skin is tooAMPUTATION. 577 often divided from the elastic integuments stretching before the knife. Disad- By the plan of cutting the flap from without inwards, this disadvantage vantages, is, however, neutralised, while an extra advantage is gained, for the Cutting flaps surgeon can often cut a longer skin than muscular flap, which in large trom^vithcmt limbs is a matter of importance. In some amputations, as of single hones, the operation may be per- formed by cutting the anterior flap from without inwards, and the posterior by transfixing. In the arm and thigh, when I select the flap amputation, this method is that which I usually adopt. In cutting the flap by transfixion, particularly in the thigh, the surgeon should always support it with his left hand, and, when a sufficient flap has been made, cut sharply outwards (Fig. 610). Sir W. Fergusson says, with respect to the flap operation, “ if, in tranfixing, the flaps he made purposely short, and then, retraction being made, the knife be carried round the exposed tissues which cover the hone, a cone will be formed resembling that in the ordinary circular operation, and thus by a combination, a compromise of the two methods (the circular and the flap), a covering to the end of the bone, in other words a stump, will be left superior, in my estimation, to any other,” “ though,” he adds, “ that cutting from without inwards is in many instances followed by the best results.” (Lect. on Prog, of Surg., 1867.) Besides these recognised forms of amputation, many others are per- Utilising skin formed, the surgeon having too often “ to cut the flap according to forfl“l,s- the tissues,” particularly in cases of injury. He has to utilise what skin there is left uninjured in order to prevent the necessity of ampu- tating higher up; it may he that one external or internal flap can be made, one anterior or posterior—in fact, any form or combination of flaps the surgeon may be called upon to make to carry out the object he has in hand, viz. the removal of the part that must be removed and no more, with the least sacrifice of parts. Indeed, as already stated, under rare circumstances, an amputation may he best performed without flaps, or with poor ones, it being a safer, and, I believe, a sounder practice to take off a part that must be removed to save life, immediately above the seat of injury, even with had, poor, or no flaps, than for the sake of making flaps that may slough, to amputate higher up, possibly with the sacrifice of a joint, and by so doing to incur an unnecessary danger to the life we are operating to save, Petit’s fun- damental rule being far from true, that “ as little of the flesh should be cut away as possible, hut the more the bone is removed the better.” (‘ Traite des Malad. Chir.,' tom. iii, p. 250.) As a variety of the antero-posterior flaps the surgeon may at times, by transfixion, make the posterior one first, and then taking between bis fingers and thumb all the soft parts not included in the posterior flap, complete the operation either by passing the end of the knife beneath these tissues and cutting outwards, or by cutting from without inwards, as in the former case. This plan is most expeditious, aud was one generally adopted by the late Mr. Morgan, of Guy’s. In some cases, two lateral flaps may be made by either transfixion or cutting from without inwards. VOL.

The surgeon having decided upon the operation, and obtained the consent of the patient or of his friends to its performance, should see, unless time presses, that any faecal accumulation is removed by either a mild aperient or an enema administered thirty-six hours beforehand, and that as good a meal as the patient can take be given four or five hours before the time fixed for the operation. The meal should be of meat, where possible, with some stimulant, or, when solids are not acceptable, of a mixture of milk, egg, and brandy ; for, assuming that chloroform or some aueesthetic is to be administered, it is essential, to guard against sickness, and to have the process of digestion fairly completed beforehand, since vomiting is more prone to take place with a full than an empty stomach. The part to be operated upon should be well washed previously, and, when much hair is present, also shaved before the patient is placed upon the operating table. All instruments and dressing appliances should be arranged out of the patient’s sight before the time of the operation, and a sufficient number of assistants provided and special duties allotted to them. Thus, on one tray there should be a tourniquet or elastic bandage to prevent haemorrhage, and good torsion forceps to twist, or ligatures to tie the vessels; amputating knives of sufficient length and size, with a bis- toury or catlin to divide the soft parts, and saw and bone forceps for the treatment of the bone; a tenaculum should likewise be at hand to take up vessels that have retracted; there should be also a pair of scissors, and a linen retractor. The torsion forceps I employ (Fig. 120) are as good for taking up an artery to tie as for twisting. On a second tray every appliance for the dressing of a stump should be arranged, such as suture needles armed with waxed silk, wire, or carbolised catgut; strapping cut into sufficient lengths and breadths; lint for pads or dressings, and splints when applicable; a can for hot water to heat the strapping should not be omitted; hot and cold water in abundance, clean sponges supplied by the surgeon, w’ell washed in iodine water and squeezed dry, and soft towels so arrangedas to bealways at the surgeon’s command during the operation, must be provided. With respect to assistants, one to give the anaesthetic is a necessity, and, when possible, he should be an expert to whom the surgeon can resign his patient with confidence, as it is trying and somewhat risky for the operator when otherwise engaged, to have an eye to the anaes- thetist. A second is wanted to hold the limb above and to command the artery of the limb to be amputated; a third to hold the limb below till it is removed, and subsequently, to sponge and help to twist or tie the vessels ; while a fourth is of essential service in amputation of the thigh and leg to hand the instruments, sponge, or to do what may be required, &c. They should be placed as shown in Fig. 609. The nurse should be near to take aw7ay and clean all sponges as they are used, and to replace them with others, squeezed quite dry. When the operation has to be performed by daylight the table should be placed where the best light can be obtained, and when by candle- light, sufficient provision must be made. A good operating lamp is of great use, as well as a hand-glass to throw light upon any one part. The operating table should be narrow and steady, a kitchen table with flaps being the best, and is always available. In hospitals, there ought always to be a special table.AMPUTATION. 579 In amputations of the upper extremity the patient should he brought well to the side of the table, and in amputations of the lower ex- tremity well downwards, the opposite limb being secured by a turn of a bandage or strap to the leg of the table. In amputating, the surgeon should always stand on the right-hand Snreeon’s side of the part to be amputated, in order to keep during the operation position, full control with his left hand of the flaps, and possibly, of the main arteries, and afterwards of the stump. He should, moreover, see that the tourniquet is so fixed as to control the vessel when tightened, which Tourniquet, should on no account be done until the operation is about to be com- menced. The limb to be amputated should be emptied of its venous blood before fixing the tourniquet, by raising its end for one or two minutes and smoothing with pressure the veins from below upwards Elevation of with the hand. The limb should then be constricted high up by a tourniquet, or, Esmarch’s elastic bandage. In the flap operation now being considered (and for the sake of illustration I will suppose it to be a thigh) the surgeon should mark out with his eye the point at which he proposes to divide the bone, and, with his thumb on one side of the limb, and fingers on the other, grasp it at a spot corresponding to the base of the anterior flap he is about to make, cutting from without inwards, taking care that the Fig. 609.

The muscles should then be divided down to the bone with a clean cut of the knife made from heel to point, and re- flected with the skin flap. The anterior flap having thus been made, the point of the knife ought then to be passed through the wound beneath the bone, and the limb so transfixed as to include all the tissues that remained undivided. The knife should then be made to run downwards parallel to the bone, far enough to make a flap of the required length, and then turned backwards, the downward cut being made sharply (Pig. 610). Fig. 610. Amputation of the thigh by flap operation. The surgeon during this stage of the operation should support with his left hand the under surface of the posterior flap. When the ante- rior flap has been only made of sufficient length to cover half the face of the stump, the posterior must be cut long to allow the two to meet. When the anterior flap has been a long one, two thirds of the length required to cover the stump, the posterior flap need only be half the length of the anterior. Long flaps always yield the most satisfactory results. When the flaps have been made, they shouid be carefully held away from the bone, which is to be bared upwards for about an inch above their base where it is to be divided, and two periosteal flaps cut and pressed upwards. The soft parts ought to be carefully held away from the bone to escape injury, and for this purpose, the linen retractor is of great value. The saw must then be applied, the bow saw (Fig. 609) being probably better than the flat. It should be used from heel to end with a firm, decided, yet free movement; too much pressure upon it being likely to cause splintering of the bone. During these steps of the operation, the assistant who holds the limb must be careful neither to elevate nor to depress it, for he will cause by the former act the sur- geon’s saw to become locked, and by the latter, splintering of the lower border of the bone. The best plan for the assistant to adopt is to applyAMPUTATION. 581 extension to the limb in the axis of the bone to he divided, as if to draw the patient downwards, though not with sufficient force to effect this result. When any splintering of the bone has taken place the rough margin Splintering ought to be carefully smoothed down with the cutting forceps, care of bone- being observed not to tear away the periosteum. Dr. McGill, of the United States Army, has suggested the propriety Periosteal of making the periosteal flaps as described above to cover iu the end ^dP- of the divided bone iu amputation, and gives three cases in which this was done with excellent effect (Circ.

The bone being sawn through, the stump is to he raised and the Securiug the main artery at once seized; the vessel should be drawn out of its vessels, sheath, firmly held with forceps (Fig. 120) and sharply twisted suffi- ciently often for the surgeon to feel that resistance has gone. The end ought not to be twisted off. The smaller arteries should he treated in the same way, it possibly being the best practice to twist off the ends Torsion, of the small muscular and cutaneous branches. When ligatures are preferred they may be used, the carbolised catgut Ligatures, probably being the best. As soon as the chief vessels have been secured, the tourniquet should be taken away and the stump elevated to assist the venous circulation, the assistant being ready with his finger to compress the main artery of the limb if any vessel remain unsecured. Any nerve trunks that have been cut long in the flaps should be removed to a level with the hone. A stream of iodine water may then be made to pass over the end of the stump to cleanse it of all blood, and check capillary bleeding, and the surface dried with a soft towel, the surgeon satisfying himself that the vessels are all safely secured. The edges of the flaps may then be adjusted and kept in apposition by sutures, which must sutures not be put in too closely, but inserted about half an inch from the margin of the wound, and made to perforate the skin and fat obliquely to the free border of the flap; the most dependent corner of the wound should be left open for the introduction of a drainage tube.

A posterior splint ought then to be fixed on the stump (Fig. 611), Splint, with pads of lint or sponge to maintain steady pressure upon the base of the flaps, though not on the wound, and a piece of dry lint or gauze, through which a hole has been cut for the end of the drainage tube, is to be applied to the surface of the wound.

To seal a wound completely and not to leave a drainage opening must always be re- garded as bad practice. With well-adjusted flaps, good drainage, and rest, as secured by the application of a splint, most stumps may be expected to do well. Dressing The stump may be raised, as in Fig. 611, for the first day after the stump. operation, but subsequently placed in a horizontal position. It should not be dressed for three or four days unless it becomes uncomfortable or the discharge offensive, for the less the parts are disturbed during the early days the better, repair going on much more satisfactorily when left alone than when the dressings are too frequently changed. To dress a stump, the trough, water-can, and tube, as illustrated in Fig. 613, are to be recommended. Fig. 613. Trough and water-can for dressing slump.

Of late years I have used with advantage terebene mixed with olive oil, 1 part to 3. Prof. Humphry, of Cambridge, many years ago, was so impressed Humphry's with the evil attending the retention of serum or other fluids after treatment, amputation, that he was led to dispense with dressings altogether. He left the wound exposed, and allowed a scab to form over its surface. This practice has been followed by Dr. J. Wood, of New York, and other good surgeons since; and, although to my mind, it is not so satis- factory as pressure applied to the base of the stump, a free opening at its surface for drainage, perfect rest as enforced by use of a splint, and gentle support given to the whole by cotton wool, it is decidedly superior to the plan of covering the whole up with strapping and allowing no outlet for the escape of serum or other pent-up fluid. No one denies the evil influence of such fluids—-firstly, in causing pain by the tension of the distended parts; and secondly, by incurring the risk of their decomposition, and subsequently of septicaemia. In recent times, however, theories have sprung up which have origi- Antiseptic nated new practices, and the most important is that on which the so-called antiseptic treatment of wounds is based. Lister is its chief advocate, and under the influence of his great authority it has esta- blished a position which deserves attention. The theory upon which the practice is based is one thing, but the practice is another. At present, the germ theory is not established, although the practice based upon it has taken a hold on the professional mind in this and other countries, and has so much success to boast of, that its value, under certain conditions, cannot be disputed. How much of this success is due to the care observed by the surgeon who dresses the wound, and the close personal attention which any case so treated necessarily re- ceives, and how much it depends upon the means employed for placing a wound as much as possible under the conditions of a subcutaneous injury is not yet determined. I am disposed to think, that this latter point is the more important, and that where the conditions can be fulfilled, the practice is to be recommended. The theory on which this practice is based, which I give in Lister’s own words, is founded upon the Ljster*s labours of Pasteur, who believed he had proved “ that putrefaction description, is not occasioned by the chemical action of oxygen or any other gas, but is a species of fermentation analogous to that of sugar under the influence of the growing yeast plant, being brought about by the development of microscopical organisms, the germs of which, from their extreme minuteness, float in abundance in the air as constituents of its dust. This being once clearly understood, it is plain that putrefaction in wounds may be avoided without excluding the air by dressing them with some agent capable of destroying the vitality of the atmospheric organisms, provided that it does not act with too great violence upon the human tissues. . . Carbolic acid,” adds Lister, “ happened to be the first agent that I employed on this principle, and it still appears to be the most convenient for the purpose; it also has the advantage of being a local anaesthetic.” “ In dealing with an accidental wound it is necessary first to kill any septic organisms introduced into it from the air or from contact with foreign bodies, and this is done by washing the cut surface thoroughly with a saturated watery solution (one of the acid to twenty584 THE GERM THEORY. of water); but even this is felt to be a somewhat uncertain process, because some mischievous particle, lurking in some interstice among the tissues, may possibly elude the action of the lotion, and subse- quently propagate its kind and spread putrefactive fermentation throughout the wound. For it is important to bear in mind that the acid applied to the interior has no persistent antiseptic effect, but is speedily dissipated, being partly washed away by the discharge and partly absorbed into the circulation. When, however, the wound is made by the surgeon himself on a previously unbroken integument (as in amputation) he has it in his power to prevent putrefactive organisms from ever entering it alive by operating in an antiseptic atmosphere, iu the form of a cloud of spray imbued with the acid. Richardson’s spray apparatus, as suggested for ether, with a solution Solution 1 to of acid one to forty, answering every purpose, while the sponges are rendered harmless by wringing them out of a watery solution, the fingers of the surgeon and his assistant having been dipped in the same, and the saw and other instruments smeared with oil containing a tenth part of the agent. The wound must be covered with a cloth dipped in the lotion during any periods of suspension of the spray, which should, with such exceptions, be continued throughout the entire process, including the securing of the vessels and the intro- duction of the stitches.”—Lister. “ For cases of compound fracture seen for the first time several hours after the accident I use a solution of one part of carbolic acid in five of spirit of wine, introducing it by means of a catheter and syringe.” — Lister, ‘ Lancet, ’ March 13th, 1S75. How to Lister further advises the use of catgut ligatures or sutures, prepared Pl'®Pal'e by steeping them for about two months in an emulsion made by gu ures an mixing one part of crystallised carbolic acid, deliquesced by means of water with five parts of olive oil, this emulsion being kept in a jar with a perforated diaphragm supported a little from the bottom of the jar, in order that the gut may rest upon it in the oil, the water sub- siding. He says it is as safe as any ligature, superior to wire, and does not act as a foreign body in the wound, the ends being absorbed. He has never known secondary haemorrhage to follow its use. During the insertion of the sutures, the spray is to be employed. “ At the completion of the operation it remains to carry out the other division of the antiseptic treatment, viz. to apply such an ex- ternal dressing as shall securely guard for the future against the penetration of septic fermentations from without. “ For this purpose the most convenient material I have yet arrived at is the antiseptic gauze, made by impregnating a cotton cloth of open texture with a mixture of carbolic acid one part, resin five parts, paraffin seven parts, in which the resin serves as a vehicle for the acid, while paraffin is added to prevent inconvenient adhesiveness.” “ This dressing, while it absorbs discharge, holds the antiseptic securely lodged in its fibres, where it is retained by the insoluble resin, and it is to this circumstance that it owes its superiority over most other porous applications. It is wrapped round the stump in about eight layers, and during the first few days, while there is a copious effusion of serum, it is well to surround it with some impermeable tissue to prevent the discharge from passing directly outwards, and to compel it to travel along the whole extent of the antiseptic invest- ligatures. -Antiseptic dressings. Gauze.ANTISEPTIC DRESSINGS. 585 ment which should reach several inches up the stump. The most durable aud reliable is a fine cotton cloth, with a thin layer of caout- chouc on one side, known in the shops as hat lining. The gauze is also extremely useful in the form of antiseptic bandages, whether to check a tendency to retraction of the soft parts ot a stump, or, for securing and completing a dressing. If strapping is required, common Antiseptic adhesive plaster may he rendered antiseptic by dipping it for a second strapping. or two in a watery solution of the acid; and it is most convenient to have the lotion hot, so that the strap is warmed at the same time by its immersion. It can then be applied effectively under the spray, which should always be used in changing the dressings of a stump, till the wound hasbecomesuperficial. The antiseptic atmosphere not only affords perfect security against the introduction of mischief, which it would otherwise be extremely difficult to avoid, hut has the great advantage of permitting free inspection and manipulation of the stump. When the spray is intermitted, the wound must he covered with a “ guard of rag dipped in the lotion. The ends of the adhesive straps should be overlapped by the gauze, to prevent them from subsequently conduct- ing putrefaction inwards. While discharge is free, the dressings should be changed daily; but as it diminishes, the intervals may he increased, till when there are merely a few minims in twenty-four hours the gauze may he left undisturbed for a week together.” “ Besides these antiseptic precautions, there are two other points Drainage, essential to bear in mind in carrying out the treatment, viz. to provide for the due escape of serum, and to protect healing parts from the irritating influence of the antiseptic gauze. For the first purpose I have found it convenient to lay in the wound a strip of lint soaked with an oily solution of carbolic acid (1 to 10), one end hanging out as a drainer, this being removed on the second day of the operation under the spray. For the second purpose it is necessary to protect the cica- trising part by interposing between it and the gauze a layer of oil- silk coated on both sides with copal varnish, and afterwards brushed over with dextrine to enable it to become uniformly moistened when dipped into a watery solution. It is thus immersed just before being laid upon the wound, the dressing of the wound consisting of an antiseptic to keep out putrefaction, and an unstimulating protec- tive to exclude the antiseptic.” “ For lubricating instruments intro- duced into the bladder I use a solution of carbolic acid in olive oil, 1 part to 20.” Lister uses also boracic acid in solution, or as lint, or ointment. “This practice,” writes Lister, “will be found by no means difficult Advantages or complicated. It requires no special skill, and the care which it is ulaimed- essential to take soon becomes habitual and instructive, and in the aggregate saves the surgeon a great deal of time, besides relieving him of a load of anxiety. For when a few days have passed without putrefaction, the dressings may be left unchanged for several days together, while at the same time the patient is felt to be absolutely secure against the various risks of pyrninia, erysipelas, hospital gan- grene, necrosis, osteo-myelitis, or exhaustion from profuse suppuration.” “Surely,” he adds, “these are advantages well worthy of our best efforts to attain them,” and in this I cordially a°ree; but more experience is wanted before these advantages that Lister claims for it are established. 1 am no convert as yet to the theory on which it586 AMPUTATION. The facts of antiseptic surgery wanted. Teale’s amputation. is based, nor to the great value of the special practice based upon it; neither is yet proved, and it is much to be regretted that the originator of the system should not have listened to the repeated requests of surgeons to publish the results of his practice as a whole, since it can be by such alone that the value of the method is to be estimated. The publication of isolated cases, however good, proves nothing, whereas the withholding of the whole suggests much. In Germany and in this country, the practice has made good progress, but it has suffered a little at the hands of its friends, for, when a German surgeon, in advo- cating a certain operation, states that “the justification of operations like these undoubtedly depends entirely on the possibility of guarantee- ing a successful termination,” and expresses his opinion that “ we [the adopters of the antiseptic method] are not assuming too much in say- ing, that we have by degrees obtained sufficient practice and experience in the antiseptic treatment of wounds to be really able to pro- nounce such a result with certainty” (‘ Edin. Med. Jour.,’ March, 1875), surgeons of a cooler temperament, who are not disciples of Lister’s school, are startled; but, when they find such a cautious surgeon as Lister endorsing the observations, and adding to them, by saying that the passage I have quoted and he italicised “ breathes the true spirit of earnest scientific surgery, and is remarkable for the modesty as for the confidence of its tone,” surprise is exchanged for another feeling. As an observer, who has no prejudice for or against the practice, I confess that I can neither recognise the modesty of the assertion nor the true spirit of scientific surgery it breathes ; lean see in it the spirit of the advocate and the enthusiast, but not the calm mind of the judi- cial surgeon. Surgery, however, is unquestionably indebted to Mr. Lister for the introduction of his system, since it has proved that closer personal attention to cases, and the observance of what were regarded as little things, are of great importance; but our knowledge of nature’s pro- cesses of repair, although great, is not enough to justify any surgeon in guaranteeing any special result even in the simplest case; and the antiseptic treatment is not of such proved superiority as to justify any surgeon in claiming a control over its results, for that is what the power of guaranteeing means. I have given the practice in the words of the distinguished originator, feeling that if it had no other influence to back it than Professor Lister’s name and authority it ought to have a fair trial and be honestly tested. The system may be good, and if so, will find its place in surgery, but over-confidence in its power will not help it. Like others, it will have to be judged by the true spirit of scientific surgery, and by that alone; but first let us have the facts. Teale’s amputation, a modification of the skin and muscular flap. This was introduced “ to procure a more useful stump, and in the hope of somewhat diminishing the mortality of the operation. It is proposed to amputate by a long and a short rectangular flap, the long Hap folding over the end of the bone being formed of parts generally devoid of large blood-vessels and nerves, whilst those important struc- tures are contained in the short flap. The size of the long flap is determined by the circumference of the limb at the place of amputa- tion, its length and its breadth being each equal to half the circum- ference. The long flap is, therefore, a perfect square, and is longTE ALE’S AMPUTATION. 5S7 enough to fall easily over the end of the bone. In selecting the struc- tures for its formation, such parts must be taken as do not contain the larger blood-vessels and nerves. A flap so formed will be, for the most part, anterior in position, as far as regards the general aspect of the body, but superior when the patient is in the recumbent position, as during the after-treatment. The short flap, containing the chief vessels and nerves, is, in length, one fourth of the other (Fig. 614). The flaps being formed, the bone sawn, and the arteries tied or twisted, the long flap is folded over the end of the bone, and each of its free angles fixed by suture to the corresponding free angle of the short flap. One or two more sutures may be required to complete the transverse line of union of the flaps, and to unite the side of the short to the corresponding portion of the long, as well as the reflected portions of the long flap to its unreflected. Thus the transverse line of union is bounded at each end by a short lateral line at right angles The surgeon should be careful in making this long anterior flap not to Caution in scarify it with his knife, more particularly whenitis chiefly skin, as in the making flaps, leg, since, on account of its length, it is very prone to slough, and if scari- fied this tendency is increased ; indeed, this sloughing of the long flap is the great disadvantage of the operation, for in an ordinary thigh, twelve inches in circumference, a flap of six inches would have to be made. To secure a cicatrix away from the extremity of a stump is a point of great practical value, and to do so by a long anterior flap is, doubtless, an advantage; but this often requires more soft parts than are generally at the surgeon’s disposal, unless more of the limb be taken away than requires removal. This object may, however, sometimes be secured by making a shorter anterior flap than Teale suggests, and dividing the bone one or two inches above the line of the skin flaps. In fact, as long as the anterior flap, whether rectan- gular or oval, is of sufficient length to be drawn over the end of the stump to its posterior aspect, the principle of Teale’s operation is observed. Mr. Spence, in his ‘ Surgery,’ 1871, p. 749, tells us that he acted i-'iG. 614. to it.”garden’s amputation. 588 Mixed form of amputation. Carden’s description. much upon this principle in 1858, making one long anterior slcin and muscular flap, with a short posterior, clearing the hone for nearly two inches before dividing it. The Mixed Form of Amputation. The mixed form of amputation, as illustrated by Carden’s operation, will now claim attention. In principle, it includes a combination of the circular and flap, already described. “ The operation consists in reflecting a rounded or semi-oval flap of skin and fat from the front of the joint (knee), dividing everything else straight down to the bone, and sawing the bone slightly above the plane of the muscles, thus forming a flat-faced stump with a bonnet of integument to fall over it. The operation is simple. The operator, standing on the right side of the limb, seizes it between his left fore- fiuger and thumb at the spot selected for the base of the flap, and enters the point of the knife close to his finger, bringing it round through skin and fat below the patella to the spot pressed by his thumb, then turning the edge downwards at a right angle with the line of the limb, he passes it through to the spot where it first entered, cutting outwards through everything behind the bone. The flap is then reflected, and the remainder of the soft parts divided straight down to the bone ; the muscles are then slightly cleared upwards, and the saw is applied. Or the limb being held as before, the hand and knife may be brought round under the limb, as in the circular operation, and the blade entered near the thumb and drawn round to the opposite side, when the ham may be cut across by turning the edge of the knife upwards, and the operation completed as before. In amputating through the condyles the patella is drawn down by flexing the knee to a right angle before dividing the soft parts in front of the bone; or, if that he in- convenient, the patella may he reflected downwards.” (‘ Brit. Med. Journal,’ April, 1864.) Fig. 615. Carden’s amputation, witli Ions posterior flap. I s principle. This operation of Mr. Carden’s is very valuable, not only as applicable to the knee-joint to which it was originally applied, but onCARDEN’S AMPUTATION. 589 account of the principle of practice it embodies, that of making skin flaps and the circular division of the muscles. The practice, however, was not new, for when Mr. Carden began it in 1846, Mr. Syme had published in the ‘ Edin. Month. Journ. of Med. Science ’ ot the same year, his modification of the circular method of amputation in the lower third of the thigh, by making two semilunar skin lateral flaps and oblique section of the muscles down to the bone, dissecting the skin flaps an inch or more upwards, and cutting the muscles on a level with the retracted skin. Liston also, in 1839, preferred skin flaps alone in muscular subjects. Accepting it as an operation for the removal of a limb through the condyles of the femur, I have, however, found it advisable to make a slightly longer posterior flap than Carden advises (vide fig. 615), making it only of skin, and taking care to make the long anterior its flap broad, with a base corresponding to the posterior border of the advantages. lateral surfaces of the condyles. In this operation, there is but a slight section of the muscular tissue, and beyond the popliteal artery, few vessels of importance are divided. The stump that remains is likewise remarkably good, being long and broad upon which patients can bear their weight without pain. This operation is, I believe, applicable to a far larger number of cases than is generally thought, and, with Lister, I look upon it as a great ad- object of vance in surgery. It is, moreover, far safer than amputation through long the shaft of the femur. skinflaps. The object sought in all these long anterior flap operations is to procure a cicatrix that is placed behind the stump out of harm’s way, and so long as this end can be secured without sacrificing more of the body than is absolutely required by the exigencies of the case the amputation is good; and it is a matter of small importance whether the rectangular and muscular flaps of Teale, the convex skin flaps of Carden, or the skin and muscle as practised by Spence, be employed. I prefer Carden’s flap with the modifications described to any other, General and, when applied to the knee, where it is most applicable, regard it applicability with high favour. dhmHo'311 This “ mixed method of amputation” has, however, a wider applica- amputations, tion than to operations about the knee; and, I believe it to be by far the 1'ig. 616.

It combines the advantages of the circular and the flap without the disadvantages; and rarely, if ever, calls for the sacrifice of more of the extremity than is absolutely required. In its performance the two lateral skin flaps should be made sufficiently long to meet over the stump withoutAmputation at the shoulder- joint.

Fig. 617. stretching, the surgeon judging by his eye their required length, while the muscles should be divided by a circular sweep an inch below the base of the retracted flaps, the bones being bared to this extent before they are divided (Fig. 616). Mr. Cock includes the muscles in the flap, but I hardly think this necessary unless the skin is very thin. When the flaps are brought together a pretty stump is seen, and sub- sequently it turns out to be a very good one (Fig. 617). In amputation of the forearm, the mixed form is the operation, the skin flaps being made from the anterior and posterior aspects of the limb, the flap amputation executed by transfixion, being very unsatisfactory, on account of the tendons of the forearm (Fig. 622). In amputation at the wrist-joint and elbow- joint nothing can be better than this mixed method (Figs. 620-1), the surgeon having it in his power, according to circumstances, to make one long anterior, posterior, or lateral flap cover the stump, and thus to secure the cicatrix being out of harm’s way. One of the best stumps of this kind I ever obtained was at the elbow-joint, in which I made a long skin posterior flap, the cicatrix subsequently being placed above the condyles of the bone and in front (Fig. 621). Stump after an ampu- tation of the leg by the mixed method. SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. The subject of amputations as a whole having been considered, I propose now to describe them in detail as applicable to different parts of the body, and begin with the upper extremity. Amputations at the Shoulder-joint. This operation may be called for in cases of injury, when the arm has been so irreparably injured as to render amputation through the tuberosities impossible or excision inapplicable; or for disease, when too extensive to be taken away by a less severe measure; the surgeon always bearing in mind that large portions of the humerus may be resected with advantage so long as the chief vessels and nerves of the arm are intact, and that amputation through the humerus, however high, leaves a far better stump than at the joint. After this operation, when performed for injury, one out of three cases die; but when for disease, one in two. The operation is best performed by means of the double flap opera- tion. A good assistant is required to compress the subclavian artery above the clavicle, or to take charge of the axillary in the lower flap. When the right arm has to be amputated the surgeon should stand beliiud, and when the left in front of his patient (Fig. 618); under both circumstances a deltoid flap should be first made, cutting from without inwards from the posterior part of the axilla to an inch in front of the acromion process, this incision including in its sweep the whole deltoid muscle. Having reflected this flap with a591 AMPUTATION AT THE ARM. * few bold sweeps of the knife, the head of the humerus should be disarti- culated, the knife being kept close to the bone, aud the lower flap Fig. 618. made, three or four inches long, by cutting from within outwards. If this part of the operation is done with care, the main artery of the limb will only be divided on the completion of the second flap, when the surgeon with his left hand can secure it between his finger and thumb until it cau be either twisted or tied. During the first step of this amputation, the arm should be held well out by an assistant, but during the second, at first, near the body, and when the knife has passed beneath the head of the bone it should be abducted. A very good stump usually follows this operation. At no joint of the body, however, is the surgeon more compelled to form his flaps according to the circumstances of the case than at the shoulder, since the majority of cases of amputation at this part are for injury, where the arm has been wholly or partially torn off, when the surgeon must make the best flap he can, and at times no flap at all. As good a stump as I have made at this joint was one in which a piece of in- tegument from the posterior part of the arm was alone available. I have seen many cases in which the flaps sloughed, and yet good cica- trices followed, the soft parts being readily drawn forward by the cicatricial process. Some surgeons in this amputation prefer making an anterior and Anterior and posterior flap, by perforating in front of the posterior axillary fold to posteriorflap. make the posterior flap, disarticulating and dividing the axillarv artery in the anterior flap ; but the operation, although good, is not so "efficient as the former.

When, however, the forearm and elbow-joint are hopelessly injured, gangrenous, or diseased, amputation may be demanded, and, therefore,’ as the very worst cases are included in this category, the mortality of the operation is great, viz. one in three for injuries, and one in ten for disease. Fig. 619. Amputation of arm by flap operation. The flap operation, as already described, is the best in this region, the anterior flap being made by cutting from without inwards, towards the bone, excluding the brachial artery, and the posterior by transfixing all that remains. In a very large muscular arm, the skin flap and circular cut through muscle, i.e. the mixed operation, may be performed. Amputating by double flaps and transfixion is, however, excellent (Fig. 619).

Amputation at the Elbow-joint is a capital operation, and ought always to be performed in preferenceAMPUTATIONS AT THE FOREARM AND HAND. 593 to any higher operation, when amputation of the forearm is imperative, if the condition of the soft parts will allow. By this operation an excellent stump is obtained, and, as in other amputations at joints, with less constitutional disturbance, and probably less risk to life than after other methods of amputation. I have had a patient up and about on the seventh day after such an operation, the wound having united without any traumatic fever or other disturbance. It should be performed by the mixed method of amputating, by anterior and posterior skin semi-circular flaps, beginning and ending at the lower extremities of the condyloid ridges, the muscles being divided transversely on completing the disarticulation (Fig. 620). In the drawing of the stump (Fig. 621) the posterior flap was made longer than the anterior, in order that the cicatrix might be out of harm’s way. I have performed 'this operation on six occasions, and the result in all was so good that 1 cannot too strongly advocate it whenever the injury or disease will allow; in fact, it ought to be per- formed whenever enough integument can be saved to cover the bone, and the disease or injury for which amputation is called for has not attacked the humerus. Amputation at the Forearm. This is comparatively a rare operation, modern surgeons doing their Amputation utmost to save the hand. It is consequently only performed when through the the hand is hopelessly crushed, or so extensively diseased as to forbid forearm, any other treatment being entertained. At Guy’s Hospital it was performed only eighty-four times in thirty years ending 1874—on forty-four occasions for injury, nine patients dying, or oue in five; and on forty occasions for disease with five deaths, or one case in eight, the operation being performed in the very worst cases. Amputation of the forearm ought always to be performed by the mixed method; the one by transfixing being very unsatisfactory, the many tendons, &c., of the part causing ragged flaps, and thus favouring suppuration. Two well-cut and fairly long semi-circular skin flaps and a clean circular section of the muscles are preferable to the flap operation, and Fig. 622. Amputation of forearm by mixed method. yield a good stump (Fig. 622). The skin is usually too thin for one long skin flap, and there are too many tendons for a Teale’s. Amputation at the Wrist-joint.

Both patients likewise regretted that the amputation had not been performed higher up. Under these circumstances, I am disposed to follow the opinion of my patients, and cannot advocate the operation. If, however, it be called for, it should be performed with skin flaps and the circular division of the deeper tissues, or by the pure circular operation. Amputation of thumb and fingers. Anatomical details. Amputation of fingers at metacarpal joint. Amputation of the Thumb and Fingers. A knowledge of the shape of the articular ends of the bones and the position of the different articulations of the hand is of importance in all operations on these parts, and I have, therefore, supplied a figure to illustrate these points as much as possible (Fig. 623). The surgeon should remember, that with the hand closed, the knuckles are formed by the heads of the me- tacarpal bones, the bases of the pha- langes being in front, and that in the second and third rows the same arrangement holds good. To open any of these joints, consequently, the line of incision should be anterior to the knuckles on the dorsal aspect and in the fold of the fingers on the pal- mar. In the figure it will be observed also that the two distal joints are concave, with the concavity looking towards the ends of the fingers, while at the metacarpal joints the concavity points the other way, the heads of the metacarpal bones being round; from the palmar surface the metacarpo-phalangeal joints are at least half an inch behind the clefts of the fingers, corresponding pretty nearly with the palmar furrow of the hand, this furrow likewise corre- sponds with the upper limit of the synovial sheaths of the flexor tendons and with the bifurcation of the digital arteries. In amputating at the phalangeal joints (Fig. 623, c) or through the bones, anterior and posterior semicircular flaps are better than one long flap, although this may at times be performed with advantage, one long anterior flap (b), after opening the joint from its dorsal aspect (a), being the most common shape; but the surgeon must in these cases be much guided by what skin he has to utilise. As a rule, it is wise not to take off the head of the proximal bone, though when there is not sufficient flap to cover it the surgeon may be justified in removing its head with bone forceps. Amputation of the fingers at their metacarpal joints requires much nicety, and in all the fingers the surgeon should remember, that he is on Fig. 623. Outline diagram for amputation of the thumb and fingers.595 AMPUTATION OF THUMB. no account, unless absolutely required, to interfere with the palm of the hand; his incision in the palmar surface must never go beyond the fold of the joint. In performing this operation the surgeon is to take charge of the amputated member, an assistant holding the hand, separating the fingers, and compressing the radial and ulnar vessels. With the hand pronated, a vertical incision should be made about one inch long with a sti’ong scalpel over the dorsal aspect of the head of the metacarpal bone, and from its distal end over the joint the knife should be made to pass up one cleft of the finger close to the bone to be removed, round the palmar surface of the finger in the fold, and through the second cleft to the point from which the circular incision started, the tendons and ligaments being divided as cleanly as possible (Fig. 623). The joint can then be opened and the finger removed. In a labouring man, it is wise not to remove the head of the metacarpal bone unless diseased, although in the higher classes it is sometimes expedient to take it away with bone forceps, to allow the neighbouring fingers to be brought closer together, and thereby to improve the aspect of the hand. With the same object it is at times wise to take off the head of the metacarpal bone of the little or index finger obliquely, i.e. in a direction sloping upwards away from the median line of the hand. In amputating either the little or index finger at this joint, the same form of incisiou may be made, the outer flap under both circumstances being somewhat larger than the inner, in order that the cicatrix may be placed close to the adjoining finger, and thus out of all harm’s way. If the incision be made so as to allow the scar to fall over the exposed aspect of the hand, the result is very inconvenient, and often painful, as the hand naturally rests on its outer borders. The same arguments apply to the amputation of the thumb, one Amputation long external skin flap adjusted to a shorter flap in the cleft being oftlluml,‘ far superior to the palmar and dorsal flaps usually adopted. But it may be here stated, that amputation of the thumb ought to be a very rare operation, as it is far better practice in all cases of injury to the thumb, where there is no possibility of saving it, simply to cut off any sharp point of bone, trim up the soft parts, and allow the stump to granulate, than to make what is sometimes called a good job of it by amputating the organ higher up; for any stump of a thumb, however short or ugly, is of use. In the hand here figured (Fig. 624) the man was an engineer, and he has been able for years to follow his occupation with but little inconvenience. To describe other amputations of different parts of the hand is unnecessary. As little as possible should be taken away, and this by making skin flaps only, care being always observed to divide the tendons by a clean cut, and as high up as possible. The ingenuity of the surgeon and the wants of the individual case will suggest the best means by which the latter can be supplied. Amputations of the Lower Extremity. Fig. 024. Ought to be very rare.

Amputation of the thigh at the hip-joint is a formidable operation, and is only justifiable under desperate conditions, when a limb is ir- reparably crushed or diseased, and resection of the head of the femur with more or less of its shaft is out of question. When performed for accident it is almost always fatal, not ten per cent, recovering; for disease, however, it is more successful, the risk being about equal, al- though after resection of the head of the f em ur which has failed it is some- what better. The best flaps appear to be the external and internal. The patient being brought to the edge of the table, with the tuberosities of the ischium in view, Lister’s valuable abdominal tourniquet is to be adjusted (Fig. 625), but not screwed up till the patient is under chlo- roform and everything prepared. The surgeon should then make the external skin flap by means of a semicircular incision, starting from the tuberosity of the ischium downwards and outwards one hand’s breadth below the great trochanter, and then upwards and forwards to the centre of the groin (on the outer side of the femoral vessels). This flap should then be reflected upwards so as to expose the trochanter, and allow the joint to be opened, and dis- articulation to be completed; the limb being forcibly adducted by an assistant to facilitate this step. In doing this, no vessels of any importance are divided, while the most difficult part of the operation is performed. The inner flap now remains to be made, which is readily done by transfixing the thigh on the inner side, inserting the knife (twelve inches long) in the anterior wound, passing back- wards close to the inner side of the neck of the femur, and bringing it out near the tuberosity of the ischium where the ex- ternal incision was com- menced, and then cutting out through the soft parts, including the ad- ductors, &c. (Fig. 626). In doing this, all the pel- vic muscles are separated from the thigh bone at one clean sweep, and a few touches of the knife complete the am- putation. Should there be much cause to fear loss of blood the common femoral artery may be ligatured in the wound Fig. 625. Fig. 626. Amputation at liip-joint, by external and internal Hups.AMPUTATION AT THE THIGH. 597 before the second flap is made, or, it may be divided and twisted. 'I he vessels can then be secured in the way the surgeon proposes, and the parts brought together, the two flaps usually forming an excellent covering to the acetabulum. The wound being an antero-posterior one, and therefore good for drainage, a good scar results. This operation I believe to be better than the anterior and posterior Usual mode, flap usually advised, and which is thus described by Erichsen :—“ It the operation be on the left side, the knife (twelve inches long) should be entered about two fingers’ breadth below the anterior spine of the ilium, and carried deeply in the limb behind the vessels directly across the joint, its point being made to issue just above the tuberosity of the ischium. In transfixing on this side care must be taken not to wound the scrotum or the opposite thigh ; the back of the knife must run parallel to, but not against, the pelvis, and the point must not be held too high, lest it enter the obturator foramen. The anterior flap must then be rapidly cut downwards and forwards about five inches in length. The limb must now be forcibly abducted and everted, the capsule of the joint opened. So soon as this is done, the head of the femur must be pushed up by forcibly depressing and abducting the limb, so that it may start out of the acetabulum; the heel of the knife is then passed behind it, the remainder of the capsule cut across, and the posterior flap rapidly fashioned by carrying the knife downwards and backwards through the thick muscles in this situation; the posterior flap may be about four inches long.” The operation is then Good to be completed as the former. In both these operations good assistants assistants are needed to compress the bleeding vessels as they are divided, for hse- nee. • morrhage and the shock of the operation are the great evils to be feared. Lister’s compressor, however, has rendered this serious operation safer than it was. Amputation at the Thigh. Primary amputations of the thigh, taken as a whole, are very serious, it3 and calculating cases at all ages more than half die. In subjects under mortality, twenty years of age, however, better results can be recorded, the mor- tality being about half this amount; whilst in those over forty, the average is worse, age having here, as elsewhere, a striking influence on results. Primary amputations, however, in the upper third of the thigh are more fatal than those in the middle; and these again are more fatal than amputations above the knee, amputations through the condyles or at the knee-joint being better than all. The nearer the operation approaches the body the greater is the risk. Still, even in the worst cases of compound fracture of the thigh, when death seems inevitable, the surgeon should operate, when, by so doing, any reasonable hope of saving life can be entertained. In amputations for diseases a better account can be given. In amputation of the thigh for chronic joint disease at all ages, the Statistics, mortality is about 1 in 4, but under the age of twenty, 1 in 17; while over that period it is 1 in 3, the difference in the mortality of the operation at the two periods being very great. Thus, taking all cases of chronic disease together, out of 89 of my own, 13 died; of 99 of Callender’s. 28; of 54 of MacCormac’s (‘Dublin Journal,’ 1868), 10; and of 106 of Holmes’s, 30; making a total of 348 cases, of Effects of «?e which 81 died, or 1 in 4.

Operation. of 69 cases of Callender’s and my own, 4 died, or 1 in 17; and of 119 cases over twenty years of age, 38 died, or 1 in 3; amputation of the thigh for chronic joint disease being nearly six times more successful in early than in middle life. This operation in the upper or middle third, when the muscles are thick, is best performed by means of anterior aud posterior skin flaps aud the circular division of the muscle, or by the flap operation as illustrated iu Fig. 610, the anterior flap being made by cutting from without inwards, and the posterior by perforating. The opera- tion by lateral flaps, whether made of skin or muscle, or skin alone and circular muscle is not satisfactory, the bones having a tendency to appear at the upper angles between the flaps. In amputation at the lower third one long anterior flap may be made, and a short posterior, as previously described under Carden’s operation (Fig. 615). Mr. W. Stokes, of Dublin, advocates (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1870, ‘ Dublin Journ. of Med. Sci.,’ 1875) the supra-condyloid amputation of the thigh, in which the femur is divided at least half an inch above the antero-superior edge of the condyloid cartilage, and the patella de- prived of its cartilaginous surface is applied to the same surface, and fixed there with carbolised catgut sutures. The anterior skin flap is made oval, and the posterior fully one third of the length of the anterior. I have performed this operation in one case with a good result, and have seen it performed on several previous occasions by my colleagues with success. I think well of it, and would suggest a wider trial. My colleague, Mr. Jacobson, has written an interesting paper on it (‘ Guy’s Hosp. Reps.,’ 1878). This operation differs from what is known as Gritti’s in the section of the femur, being about one inch higher up. Amputation at the Knee-joint. This is an excellent operation in all ways, and one that should always be performed in preference to any higher amputation when the special circumstances of the case will allow. It is apparently attended with less risk to life than when a section of the bone is made, and yields an excellent and serviceable stump, on which the weight of the body can generally be sustained. Velpeau revived the operation in 1830, while Mr. Pollock re-called the attention of London surgeons to the subject (‘Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1870). In his paper he states, that up to 1870, 48 cases of the kind had taken place in England, and that 12 died, or one fourth; but since then the operation has been more common. I have now performed it twenty-three times. On 7 occasions for compound fracture of the leg, 6 of which recovered; in 13 cases for chronic disease of the knee-joint or leg, 11 of which recovered; and in 3 cases for gangrene of the leg from arterial obstruction, one of which alone recovered, the operation in the other two having failed to save life. In only two or three of the cases did I remove the patella. In all the successful cases, excellent stumps were obtained (Fig. 627). In performing this operation, a long, broad, anterior flap should be made, which must of necessity be of skin, and also a tolerably long pos- terior, for it is remarkable to what an extent the posterior flap always retracts. 1 prefer to make my posterior flap about two thirdsAMPUTATIONS OP THE LEG. 599 Pig. 627. the length of the anterior, and of skin only, and to divide the muscles and deeper structures by cutting from behind forwards about an inch below the joint end of the tibia, and not after disarticulation; the popliteal artery being thus divided low down where it is readily secured. The patella should not be removed except when diseased. When the operation has been completed, and the articular surface of the femur is found not to be healthy, or reparable, or the flaps too short, the condyles should be taken away, a thin rounded section of bone being removed, or more if the necessities of the case demand. Dr. Brinton (‘ Phila- delphia Med. Times,’ 1872), advises the inter- articular semilunar cartilages being left. After the operation, a troublesome suppuration occasionally takes place in the synovial bursa beneath the extensor muscles of the thigh, and when it occurs it should be dealt with by free incisions. Stephen Smith, of New York, has suggested (‘ Amer. Journ. of stcph Med. Sc.,’ Jan. 1870) the formation of two lateral skin flaps for Smith this amputation, each flap to be formed by an incision commencing hooded one inch below the tubercle of the tibia, and carried downwards aud forwards over the side of the leg (vide Fig. 628) until Stump after amputation at the lelt knee-joiut.

I have adopted this method on six occasions with excellent results, and am disposed to think it the best. The stump left is very good, Fig. 629. the cicatrix being vertical and placed well behind the lower end of the femur (Fig. 629). Amputation at the Leg. Amputation of the leg for disease is a very successful operation, only about one case in twelve proving fatal. In young life, it is more successful than at a later period. Amputations for injury are, however, very unsuccessful, at least 60 per cent., or more than half the cases, dying. Pyaemia is a more common cause of death after this form of amputation than even that of the thigh. Fatality Posterior aspect of stump after S.

Hancock’s views. it being fairly proved, that the larger the section of the shaft of a bone the greater the liability to blood-poisoning. Amputations of expediency in the leg are as dangerous as those for injury. This operation in the upper two thirds is, doubtless, best per- formed by the mixed method, by two skin lateral flaps and the circular division of the muscles, as already described (Fig. 616). When the condition of the soft parts forbids such an operation, other flaps may he made, any form being allowable to avoid sacrificing more of the limb than is necessary. In the lower third of the leg, Teale’s amputation is good, the long anterior flap not being too long or so liable to slough. The long muscular flaps, and more particularly the posterior calf flap, cannot be recommended. In the lateral flap operation, Mr. Cock, who always includes the muscles and makes the flaps long, turns out excellent stumps. Some surgeons, in this mixed method, make anterior and posterior skin flaps, hut they possess no advantage over the lateral; while the anterior flap, falling over the edge of the tibia, is apt to slough or to form unpleasant adhesions. In dividing the tibia, its anterior edge should be rounded off with the saw. Amputations of the Foot. In no part of the body has an improvement in surgery shown to greater advantage than in the foot, for in none has so much been done in the way of conservatism. Where formerly amputation of the whole foot was common, we have now Hey, Chopart, Syme, Pirogoff, the subastragaloid, and Hancock’s operations, all based upon the well- established position that governs, or ought to govern, all amputations, viz. that no more of the body should be removed than the necessities of the individual case require, or, in other words, upon the principle of “the least sacrifice of parts.” To amputate a foot where anything less would suffice, in the present age. is regarded as almost criminal, and surgeons generally accept Hancock’s well-put question, in his valuable lectures at the College in 1866, “ Can anything he more unphilosophical than to advocate the sacrifice of any hone or joint of the foot for no other reason than that a particular operation should be performed ?*’ (‘Lancet,’ 1866.) Indeed, this principle of practice should be upper- most in the mind of every surgeon called upon to treat any local disease, and in the hand and foot it should he so pre-eminently. Accepting it, therefore, Hancock’s three other dicta necessarily follow. That we should perform our operation as close to the disease or damaged structure, and preserve as much of the foot as we possibly can do with safety to our patient. That, where practicable, we should cut through the tarsal bones with a saw in preference to disarticulating them. That we should avoid the destruction of parts whenever we can do so. These views of Hancock accord so closely with those I have attempted to lay down as guides to the surgeon in the surgery of other parts of the body, that I have given them in his own woi’ds, and placed them as leading principles of practice in the surgery of the foot. I believe them to be of no less scientific than practical value, and desire that the601 AMPUTATIONS OF THE FOOT. student have them always before him in the treatment of every case of local injury or disease. Indeed, it is upon this principle—viz. To sacrifice “ the least possible sacrifice of parts ”—most of the operations of the as little of foot are undertaken, and it is well to remember, that of the different amputations that have been recommended, each succeeding one is only a degree more severe than the preceding, and that none of them are called for until minor measures have altogether failed, as the surgeon in the present day takes away diseased bone or bones without fear, leaving nature to repair the breach, and in this confidence he is rarely deceived. I have taken away, in one case, the whole second row of tarsal bones, and in another, the three cuneiform, scaphoid and cuboid with excellent results. I have removed the necrosed os calcis with so little deformity that the loss could hardly be detected, and taken away on several occa- sions the upper articulating surface of the astragalus for disease, with a result which has astonished me, no external deformity remaining, and movement of the ankle being almost complete. Mr. Key in 1836 took away the whole of the outer part of the foot for injury, leaving only the os calcis, astragalus, scaphoid, inner cuneiform bone, and great toe (vide Fig. 630; ‘ Guy’s Rep.,’ 1836), from a boy, set. 17, who subsequently had a use- ful and sound foot. More recently Mr. Birkett has done the same with a like success. Single metatarsal and tarsal bones when irre- parably diseased may be re- moved with some confidence of a good result being ob- tained, and any of the ope- rations I am about to describe should only be undertaken when less severe measures are inapplicable. Upon this principle the amputations of Hey and of Lisfranc were Principle hailed with satisfaction. Key’s consisting of the disarticulation of the of the metatarsal bones from the tarsal, or the section with the saw of the differe.at metatarsal or tarsal hones, Lisfranc suggesting the disarticulation. operatlu"3- Chopart’s amputation, again at the medio-tarsal joints, and Syme’s amputation at the ankle-joint, Pirogoff’s, which is a modification of Syme’s, a part of the os calcis being preserved, have all the same end in view. The subastragaloid amputation, as recorded by Malgaigne, to save the astragalus and ankle-joint, is based upon the same principle,’ and Hancock’s amputation to save the posterior part of the os calcis with the astragalus, goes still further in the way of conservatism. All these operations have their own value, and each is applicable to its own class of cases; where the minor measure will suffice the major is out of all question, the principle of the least possible sacri- hce of parts being the one upon which they, as all other amputations should be based. 1 ’ Fig. 630.

Pig. 631. by its anatomy, for although in cases of disease these guides are greatly obscured, they are still of value, and in cases of injury they are always reli- able. The accompanying figure will help the student. On the inner side of the foot, not far from the inner malleolus, the tubercle of the scaphoid (a) is to be felt as a marked prominence; about half an inch in front of this will he found the articu- lation with the cuneiform bone (b), and one inch beyond this the joint which the surgeon will have to open in Lis- franc’s or Hey’s operation (c); just above the tubercle of the scaphoid will be found the articulation with the as- tragalus, the line of Chopart’s ampu- tation (d). On the outer side of the foot, one inch below the external malleolus, a sharply defined projection will always be felt, which is the peroneal tubercle (e), and half an inch in front of this will be found the joint which separates the os calcis from the cuboid, this joint, forming the outer guide to Chopart’s amputation. Half an inch in front of this again, or one inch from the tubercle, the prominence of the fifth metatarsal bone is always to be felt (h), the line above this prominence indicating the articulation with the cuboid bone, which forms the outer boundary of the incision for Hey’s or Lisfranc’s opera- tion. All these points should be looked for in the healthy foot, and learnt so as to be readily recognised in the injured or diseased. Hey’s amputation (Lisfranc’s). Surgical guides to foot as expressed by anatomy. The credit of introducing this operation must be accorded to Hey, for the date of the first case he published was 1797, whereas Lisfranc’s paper -was only published as a suggestion in 1815. Hey’s The operation consists in the removal of all the toes with the meta- operation. tarsal bones by disarticulation, although it seems, from reading Hey’s observations (1814), that disarticulation of the metatarsal bones was not essential, since in one of the two cases recorded, the cuboid bone was removed with some part of the astragalus, and in the second “ the projecting part of the first cuneiform bone which supports the great toe was divided with a saw,” and in others he stated, that be sawed through the metatarsal bones when the joints were not removed.

Half an inch in front of these points an incision with its convexity downwards is to be made across the dorsal aspect of the foot, dividing all the soft parts down to the bones by a second cut. The plantar flap is then to be made by two lateral incisions carried from the base of the dorsal flap along the metatarsal bones, and joined by a curved incision made on a line beyond the ball of the great toe. This flap is to be longer on the inner than on the outer side, because the internal cuneiform bone is thicker than the cuboid, and it is to include all tlie tissues down to the bones. Disarticulation has next to be performed, and this is best done from the dorsal region when the parts are put firmly on the stretch by depressing the toes. The operator then places the point of the knife on the outside of the joint and carrying its edge inwards he opens it as far as the third metatarsal bone. Around here he carries the knife half a line forwards, incises almost transversely, and thus reaches the second metatarsal. Here he must, above all things, re- member the general precept, not to engage his knife in the joint, but to work only with its point, and to confine himself to the division of the ligaments. When this instrument has reached the second metatarsal bone, he quits this side of the articulation to attack the inner side. This is well done by inserting the knife between the shafts of the first and second metatarsal bones with its edge upwards, and with a backward and forward motion dividing the ligaments holding the second bone in place, this fact being indicated by the sudden loss of resistance which the surgeon feels when pressing the toes down- wards, and by the sudden separation of the tarsus from the meta- tarsus. Disarticulation is then to be completed and the plantar flap shaped by cutting forwards close to the bone. A long dorsal flap may be made when the plantar flap must be short.” The parts are then to be brought to- gether by sutures, after securing the vessels by torsion or the ligature and cut- ting off ragged tendons. The foot should be fixed upon a splint, with the leg semi- flexed upon its outer side, and treated on ordinary principles. The stump left after this operation is good, and the operation one that ought to be performed when the toes and metatarsal bones alone require removal.

The great theoretical afd dU-g objection biought against it—the subsequent drawing up of the Vantages, heel and the consequent pointing of the stump—has really little weight, since it can be provided against by the division of the tendo Achilhs at the time of the operation, or subsequently, should the diffi- In “any ca!f °* °™> the tendons have never been divided. My colleague Mr. Cock, who has performed this operation Fig. 6S2. Stump after Hey’s amputation From Hey’s work.604 chopakt’s amputation. The operation. many times, thinks most highly of it, and never has had to amputate subsequently on account of the pointing of the stump. He believes that this can always be prevented or cured by the division of the tendo Achillis on the first indication of such a malformation. It was intro- duced into English practice in 1828, by the late Mr. James, of Exeter, and to the notice of Scotch surgeons by Professor Syme, who subse- quently, however, renounced it in favour of his own operation at the ankle-joint. He did so on account of the objection already stated, and because iu such partial amputations the part of the tarsus left behind, though apparently sound at the time, may become affected with the same disease at a later period. But such an argument may be brought against all operations less than the removal of a diseased part far from the seat of mischief, and is now fairly repudiated by modern surgeons. In fact, all excisional and conservative surgery is based upon an opposite supposition, the local nature of disease becoming daily more acknowledged and acted upon. The operation may be described as the amputation of the fore part of the foot, anterior to the astragalus and os calcis, or as the medio-tarsal amputation. On the right foot it should be commenced by making a slightly convex flap from the dorsal aspect of the foot, commencing half an inch behind the prominence of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and terminating at the tubercle of the scaphoid, the surgeon grasping the foot, with his index-finger on one point and his thumb on the other. The skin is the first part to be divided, and subsequently on the level of its retraction, all the tendons, &e., are cut through down to the bones or joints, the articulations are then opened, beginning at the scaphoid joint; the foot should be forcibly bent down- wards to facilitate this part of the operation ; the plantar flap is to be made by cutting forwards, and in doing this, care should be observed to keep the knife close to the bones on the sole of the foot, in order that the soft parts may be divided with as clean a cut as possible; the flap should be long and extend as far as the balls of the toes, and longer on its inner than outer aspect (Fig. 633). All ragged Fig. 633. tendons may be cut off short, and the parts brought together. It there be any difficulty in bringing up the fore part of the stump, or any retraction of the heel, the tendo Achillis should be divided at once, but605 syme’s operation. if no such difficulty is experienced, such a measure is unnecessary. In dressing the stump, a good opening for drainage should he left. Fig. 634 illustrates the condition of the stump a year after the opera- tion in which the tendo Achillis was not divided. On one occasion, I performed this medio-tarsal operation for injury, making two lateral flaps from the dorsum and sides of the foot, the in- tegument of the sole having been destroyed. A good stump resulted. Fig. 631. Sulmstraga- loid amputation. Stump after Chopart’s amputation. Subastragaloid amputation follows next in order amongst the amputations of the foot, and is the removal of as much as is taken away in Chopart’s amputation, with the addition of the os calcis. It should be performed when the disease for which an operation is required involves these parts, and yet leaves the astragalus and ankle-joint sound. It seems, according to Velpeau (‘ Operative Surgery,’ 1839), to have been first per- formed by M. de Lignerolles, and subsequently by Textor, although Malgaigne in 1846 described the operation as his own without mentioning these facts. It is made by a heel flap as in Syme’s ampu- tation, and a dorsal flap as in Chopart’s, the foot being removed by opening the joints between the scaphoid and astragalus, and that between this latter bone aud the calcis. “ The stump resulting from the subastragaloid amputation appears to me,” writes Hancock, “ to be perfect; it is round, and of good form ; the cicatrix is firm, and well up in front, and the bottom of the stump is perfectly covered by the natural heel tissue.” NMaton says this form of amputation “has been found to surpass all amputations” (‘ Clin. Surg.’). Hancock’s operation must be looked upon as a modification of the Hancock’s subastragaloid, in the same way as Pirogoff’s is a modification of operation. Syme’s, for Hancock saves the tuberosity of the os calcis and turns it up to be united to the lower surface of the astragalus, from which he takes a slice of bone. It maybe adopted, when in his attempt to perform the subastragaloid operation, the surgeon finds the lower surface of the astragalus diseased and the os calcis sound. Mr. Hancock performed it in 1864, with an excellent result. The incisions are very similar to those required in the subastragaloid, the end of the os calcis being divided in a line corresponding to the heel flap, instead of the flap being reflected. In the * Lancet ’ for 1866, full particulars of Hancock’s operation may be read, as described by him in a lecture at the College of Surgeons. Syme’s Operation. This consists in the removal of the whole foot with the articular 8yme’s surfaces of the bones of the leg just above the malleoli; a covering operation, for the osseous surfaces being provided from the integument of the heel, the result being, adds Lister, “ a stump admirably fitted for beariug the weight of the body. At the same time, the parts likely tosyme’s operation. 606 originate carious disease are completely got rid of; so that this operation is calculated to supersede entirely that of Chopart, besides taking the place of amputation of the leg in the majority of cases formerly sup- posed to demand it” (‘ Holmes’s Syst.,’ vol. v, ed.2). This view of the operation which was also held by its originator, ema- nating from one who was so closely connected with Syme professionally and otherwise, is doubtless far too sanguine. That the operation is good no surgeon will deny when amputation of the whole foot is called for ; but to say that it will supersede entirely Chopart’s operation is to say what I trust never will be true, for when the bones of the ankle-joint and the joint itself are sound, no surgeon ought to take away the whole foot if any minor measure will suffice. Where Chopart’s amputation is applicable, Syme’s ought not to be entertained. As an amputation of the foot, where the whole foot must be sacri- ficed, it is admirable; but, under no other circumstances can it be recommended; that it is superior to amputation of the leg most surgeons will admit, upon the same principle that Chopart’s is superior to it, on the principle of the least possible sacrifice of parts. It is, however, a successful operation, Hancock reporting (‘ Lancet,’ 1866) that out of 219 cases, only 17 died, or per cent.: 181 were operations for disease, and of these 11 died, or 65 per cent. : 32 for accidents, of which six died, or 13 per cent. The experience of the American war speaks also in its favour, for out of 67 cases only 9 died, or 13J per cent. The operation is performed as follows. I give it in' Syme’s own words :—“ The foot being held at a right angle to the leg, the point of a common straight bistoury should be introduced immediately below the fibula, at the centre of its malleolar projection, and then carried across the integuments of the sole in a straight line to the same level on the opposite side. The operator having next placed the fingers of his left hand upon the heel, and inserted the point of the thumb into the incision, pushes in the knife with its blade parallel to the bone, and cuts close to the osseous surface, at the same time press- ing the flap backwards until the tuberosity is fairly turned, when, joining the two extremities of the first incision by a transverse one across the instep, he opens the joint, and carrying his knife downwards on each side of the astragalus, divides the lateral ligaments so as to complete the disarticulation. Lastly, the knife is drawn round the extremities of the tibia and fibula, so as to expose them sufficiently for being grasped in the hand and removed by the saw. After the vessels have been tied (twisted), and before the edges of the wound are stitched together an opening should be made through the posterior part of the flap where it is thinnest, to afford a de- pendent drain for the matter, as there must always be too much blood retained in the cavity to permit of union by the first intention. The dressings should be of the lightest description. That the flap may and probably will still occasionally slough is unhappily too true; but this result is always owing to an error in the mode of performance; for as the integument, being detached from its sub- jacent connections, can derive nourishment only from the anasto- mosing of vessels, it is evident that, if scored crossways, instead of being separated by cutting parallel to the surface, the flap must lose its vitality.”pirogoff’s amputation. 607 Fig. 635. Tn Syme’s first operation, in 1842 (‘Observations in Clinical Surgery/ 1861), he simply took away the malleolar projections and did not remove the articulating surface of the tibia as subsequently advised, and it is still an open question whether any advantage is gained by this extra section of boue. I have performed this operation by Syme’s original method, with an excellent result. The stump following the amputation is excellent. Fig 635, taken from Fergusson’s lectures on the progress of surgery, illustrates it admirably:—“ The very bit of -soft material on which we naturally stand is still preserved for the future basis of this support.” Some surgeons, and Pirrie amongst them, per- form the operation by sawing through the tibia and fibula without disarticulating the foot. The modi- fication is good. Roux’s amputation differs from Syme’s only in the flap being made from the inner and under side of the heel. I have on one occasion made a long an- terior flap—the only one the condition of the parts permitted, with success. Pirogoff’3 Amputation. Stump after Syme’s amputation, from Vergusson. Pirrie’s modification. Roux’s method. This operation is to be regarded as a modification of Syme’s, and was introduced by its distinguished originator during the Crimean war. The merit he claims for it is the novel osteo-plastic pjr0g0irs principle that, a portion of one bone remaining, naturally connected amputation, with soft parts, readily unites with another, and, at the same time Fig. 636. Pirogoff’s amputation. Heel flap with calcis. serves to lengthen the limb and increase its utility. It differs from Syme’s in leaving the tuberosity of the os calcis in the heel flap instead of dissecting it out, and bringing up its exposed cut surface to unite to the divided extremities of the tibia and fibula. I have frequentlv performed it, and in every instance with a good result. Busk was the first surgeon who did it in this country, in 1857.Advantages. Amputation of the toes. 60S PIROGOFP’s AMPUTATION.

Fig. 637. Pirogoff’s amputation. Division of malleoli. T. Smith. Fig. 638. Stump after Pirogoff’s amputa- tion. When this method is employed, the surgeon should make a more oblique section of tbe os calcis from below backwards. I regard Pirogoff’s amputation as very good and it yields an excel- lent stump (Fig. 638); it ought always to be preferred to Syme’s when the os calcis is sound. If the bone at the time of the operation be found to be bad it must be removed, the operation resolving itself into a Syme’s; but when the bone is good, it appears to be a grave error to take away wbat makes so good a point of support to the body. Hancock records fifty-eight cases of this operation as performed by British surgeons. Five only, or 9 per cent., died. Amputation of the toes may be performed in the same way as amputa- tion of the fingers already described, equal care being observed not to in- terfere with the plantar surface of tbe foot. In amputating the great or little toes the same oval flaps should be made as were recommended in amputation of the thumb and little finger (page 594). They should always be large and as much skin saved as the case will allow.AFFECTIONS OF STUMPS. 609 Stumps, and their Morbid Conditions. To secure a good stump is desirable, although to obtain it by taking Slumps an.! away more of the body than is required by the exigence of the case, no mor,,il1 increased risk to life should be incurred. Many of the most promisiug stumps after an amputation often turn out badly, while the least promis- ing end well; the result depending more probably on their subsequent dressing than on the condition of the flaps at the time, it being quite certain that bad dressing may destroy the best stumps and good dress- Importance ing improve the bad. Still, the character of the stump is much deter- Hl K0!11* mined by the form of amputation that has been performed. The stump after a circular amputation (Fig 639) is not so good as that obtained after a flap (Fig. 640). The stump left after the mixed form of dressing. Fig. 639. Fig. 640. Thigh stump after a circular amputa- tion of thigh.

A stump that looks well after an operation, with a mass of muscle covering it, is sure to undergo a change ; the muscles will degenerate and the muscular fibres losing all their characteristic features, turn into fibro-cellular tissue, of which, and of fatty tissue, a good stump is formed. The end of the bone will become rounded off, and its medul- lary canal filled up; the nerves of the stump also will become bulbous to a degree, but painful only when they are involved in the cutaneous cicatrix or bound down to the bone. At times, however, stumps grow, and become conical, and in the amputations of childhood this condition must be expected. It is best seen in the leg, as it so happens that the shafts of bones grow most where they come in contact with the larger epiphyses, and in the leg, the one entering into the knee-joint is the larger. In the case of a boy, set. 7, whose leg I had to amputate, with some irregular skin flap, for a com- pound fracture, just below the knee, I have had to take away on two occasions, at intervals of three years, two pieces of bone at least an inch long, purely from the growth of the bone during childhood, and it was interesting to notice, that the tibia on both occasions had grown at least twice as much as the fibula; in my second operation I never touched the fibula. Painful stumps are most distressing; and are commonly caused by some increase in the bulbous condition of the divided nerves, the nerve being included in the cicatrix or pressed upon by the bone, and under such circumstances, a cure is readily effected by the removal of the bulbous nerve. But in others, the extreme pain seems to be due to liyperaesthesia which is often called hysterical, the slightest touch of the end of the stump being sufficient to cause convulsive twitchings of the limb, and pain flying up the stump. In these cases, operative in- terference cannot be recommended, although nerve stretching has been advocated; the general condition of the body usually associated with this affection requires attention; tonics are always required, with local soothing anodyne applications, such as belladonna, opium, or stramonium ointments, &c. Necrosis of the stump is a common condition, and it is often due to too great a separation of the periosteum from the bone at the time of the Fig. 643. Necrosis of a stump. operation from the forcible traction of the flaps backwards, and, at times, to a distinct endostitis of the divided bone (osteo-myelitis). In the former case, the necrosis is limited, and will probably show itself611 NECROSIS OF STUMPS. only as a ring of bone which may come away by itself or be removed. In the latter more or less of the shaft of the bone dies and subsequently exfoliates, tbe periosteum forming a new casing or sheath of bone to supply the dead bone’s place, as in cases already described in the chapter on ostitis. The largest sequestrum I was ever called upon to remove from a stump, was from the femur of a man whose lower extremity I amputated for disease of the knee-joint consecutive to acute necrosis of the tibia. The femur became inflamed by endostitis after the amputation, and ended in endosteal necrosis. The sequestrum was five inches long. I drew it out of the end of the stump some months after the amputation, and an excellent stump was left. I have had also a similar case in a child about six years old—necrosis of the stump following amputation for acute necrosis of the tibia extending into the knee-joint. The stump united after the operation by primary union, but the bone subsequently appeared in the wound as a necrosed mass, this change being attended with slight constitutional disturbance. In exceptionable cases, the soft parts slip away from the bone and re- tract as a whole, the stump bone suddenly protruding through them for some inches (Fig. 643). In such the periosteum covering the bone becomes inflamed and with the soft parts dying loses its attachment and retracts. The bone deprived of its periosteum projects from between the flaps as a dead or dying portionf, the result of periosteal necrosis. Under these circumstances the stump must be re-opened and the end of the bone removed high up. Sir Joseph Fayrer tells us (‘ Clin. Surg.,’ 1866) that in India, this osteo-myelitis of the ends of stumps is a common affection, and often Osteo- atteuded with severe constitutional symptoms such as are well known myelitis to accompany all cases of acute endostitis with or without amputation. after He regards the affection as so serious that he advocates the re-ampu- tation of the limb above the next joint as soon as the earliest symp- toms of systemic infection appear, blood-poisoning being the chit-f danger of the disease. “ The proper time,” he writes, “ for ampu- Fayrer’s tation in cases of diffused osteo-myelitis is as soon as possible after views, you have ascertained that the bone is affected; and the mode of arriving at this knowledge is simply the passage of a long probe down tbe medulla. Should it impinge on healthy and bleeding medulla near the surface, you may, if the constitutional symptoms permit, wait and see if nature is about to limit the suppuration and throw off the diseased bone, which is a rare result. Should it pass well up the bone, its whole death is certain. In cases of incipient inflammation the medulla will be found protruding like a fungus from the central cavity, and the bone surrounding it exposed to a greater or lesser extent; at a later period the end of the medulla is found already dead, blackened, and encrusted, but within it is a putrid mass of bone, debris, and pus. In the former stage you can watch the progress of the case. In the latter interference is immediately necessary, and that I fear can be nothing short of amputation, either about the next joint, or perhaps in a young subject at the epiphysis. The condition of the soft parts must not deceive, the condition of the bone and the constitutional symptoms must be the guide as to the time and necessity for operations.” I have made this long extract from Sir Joseph Fayrer’s paper because it is through him, that in recent times the subject has been brought pro- minently under notice, though Longmore and Holmes in this countryELECTROLYTIC CAUSTIC. 612 have ably dwelt upon it, and Roux of Toulon, made it the subject of a special report. In acute cases, there can be little doubt as to the wisdom of the practice suggested; but in English practice, they are not, however, of great frequency—the cases of necrosis of stumps met with being gene- rally of a more chronic or sub-acute kind, of either periosteal or endos- teal origin, and not requiring such active treatment, oeurismal Aneurismal enlargement of the arteries of a stump has been described ilargement py Ericlisen on Cadge’s authority, and is an accidental association. Bterics. Cancer may also attack a stump. In December, 1871,1 removed the leg-stump of a man, set. 58, for extensive cancerous disease of two years’ standing, which attacked the cica- trix that had been formed fifty-four years {vide Fig. 25). In this case amputation of both legs had been performed for gangrene of the limb when the patient was a child four years old. When the end of the bone in a stump is not well covered and is subjected to pressure, a bursa at times forms as a pro- tective agent. This occurred in the case from which Fig. 644 was taken. I ampu- tated the end of the humerus with the bursa, and a good stump was left. ancer !un,p' Fig. 644.

Electrolytic I had intended to have introduced in a former page, a valuable elec- austic. trolytic caustic which has been ably advocated by my friend and colleague Mr. C. H. Golding-lin'd in the ‘ Lancet,’ for September 28th, 1878, but omitted to do so. He applied it first for the removal of scro- fulous lymphatic glands, but it is clearly applicable to other purposes. The plan was originally suggested by the late Dr. Golding-Bird, Mr. Golding- Bird’s father, as a painless method of forming issues under v the name of the “ electric moxa.” In my dresser days it was occa- ( sionally employed to stimulate indolent and unhealthy sores, the silver ij plate being applied to the sore. It acts on the principle of a Smee’s battery, the salts in the Fig. 645. How applied, serum acting as the sulphuric acid. A is a thin silver or copper plate about 2 to 3 inches square, and B points of metallic zinc 1^ inch long thrust through shields of cork or gutta percka. The two are connected by very flexible copper wire. One or more zinc points may be used with the same silver plate. The silver is strapped firmly on to a piece of thick wash leather or lint twice or thrice folded soaked in strong salt and water placed on the skin which is previously bathed with the sameThomas’s splints. 613 fluid. Oil silk over all keeps it moist many hours. The lint must be damped night and morning. The zinc is thrust into the gland to he destroyed, with or without a previous bistoury puncture and strapped in its place. After about five days, if the zinc is removed the gland is found destroyed, and converted into a gray friable mass, very acid to test paper. The best place for the silver is over the sternum; the wire with the zinc being brought beneath the collar to the neck. Unless suppuration is excited, which is very rare, there is no pain. With some slight modifications, this caustic can be used for When keeping in check the growth of malignant diseases in parts, as the 0 rectum or cervix uteri, where other operative means are inadmissible or unadvisible. “ I have known,” adds Golding Bird, “ of its employ- ment in a case of the latter disease, where a rapid destruction of the growth and relief from pain was the result. A short rod of zinc was worn in the canal of the diseased cervix, and to it was attached a stiff copper wire insulated with gutta percha, which terminated in a silver plate that was strapped to the front of the abdomen.” Thomas's Splints for Disease of the Hip- and Knee-joints. By some oversight these splints were not noticed in their right places, but they are too good to be omitted, the one for hip disease being the only posterior splint we possess, and the other for knee disease answering admirably all the purposes of a splint, and permitting more freedom than any other. The hip splint consists of a long piece of malleable iron, one inch Thomas’s by a quarter for an adult, and three quarters of au inch by three sixteenths for children, extending from the lower angle of the shoulder-blade to the centre of the calf of the leg, to which an iron oval chest hoop, measuring four inches less than the chest circumference, is firmly rivetted to the upper end, and two half hoops to support the thigh and calf, as seen in Fig. 646. The vertical iron band is carefully modelled to the outline of the trunk and limb, and the chest hoop fitted to the sound side, but away from the diseased. The whole should be well padded, and bound to the body passing in the direction of the sound side over the posterior surface; and if this is efficiently done the diseased limb will be well supported, and the patient, if a child, can be moved readily from room to room. The curve of the instrument may re- quire alteration from time to time, as the flexed limb becomes extended, and the curved spine straight. The knee-splint is composed of a padded ovoid iron ring, three-eighths of an inch thick, to fit well up in the groin, and two vertical iron rods, ending in a patten hip-spliat. Fjg. 616.

An apron of basil leather is stretched between the iron burs' for the affected limb to rest upon, in which slits are made for the in- sertion of a bandage to keep the limb and splint together. When the patient gets up the splint is suspended by a strap buckled to the Fig. 647. Fig. 648.

When the knee is much flexed a cushion or pad should be placed behind the knee which unfolds itself by a gradual process of ex- tension. As the disease improves, and the dependent position of the limb becomes allowable, the patient can get about by means of a patten on the opposite limb. The introduction of this patten for the above purposes is worthy of all praise. Invalid Lift. This lift supplies a want. With it a patient can be raised from his bed with facility, and all dressing and nursing arrangements made without disturbing him. It can likewise be worked by an ordinary nurse, is portable and inexpensive. First place the stretcher poles on the bed, one each side of the patient, the row of small iron pins outwards. Pass one iron rod under the pillow, and turn the screwed end of it into the brass collar of the stretcher pole some five or six inches,615 INVALID LIFT. putting the other end of the iron rod, which has a collar on it, into the opposite stretcher pole; then pass the other iron rod under the feet of the patient in the same manner. Fig. 649. Iuvalid lift as made at 237, Euston Road. N.W. Pass the linen hands gently under the patient, where he is best able to hear pressure, the broad band under the shoulders and the two narrowest bands one at each end of the stretcher poles, at the same time placing the eyelet holes over the pins on each side of the stretcher poles. Tighten the linen bands by turning the iron rods with the key, thus when necessary making the stretcher perfectly rigid. Place the uprights marked No. 1 at the head of the bedstead, on the mattress or palliasse, with the number facing the foot of the bedstead ; next place the iron shoe marked No. 1 on the square end of the upright; the handle end of the pole will now rest on the bedstead and support the uprights at the head till you put up the uprights marked No. 2 at the feet, with the number towards you in the same manner, when the whole will remain firm. Each lift is marked according to these in- structions. Place the remaining pieces of wood or bases at the head and foot (on the mattress when a feather bed is used), dropping the uprights into the holes cut in the bases to receive them. If the patient lies on the mattress, then place the bases on the palliasse, so that in either case the bed or mattress can he removed and shaken and the bed made comfortably whilst the patient is suspended above. Slip the ends of the webbing attached to the long pole over the ends of the stretcher, put on the handle, and lift your patient gently by turning it to the right, and when up the required height, place the loop of webbing which is on your right hand securely over the end of the handle, when the patient will remain suspended. Take care not to let the handle slip while raising or lowering the patient.INDEX Abdomen, injuries of, i, 598; contu- sions of, i, 598; diagnosis in, i, 598; peuetrating wounds of, i, 607; gunshot wounds of, ii, 554; tap- ping, i, 638.

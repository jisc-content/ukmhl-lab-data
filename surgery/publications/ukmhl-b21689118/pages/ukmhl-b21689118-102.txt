THE OPERATIVE TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOUS ARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE. There are at present in the wards five cases of tuberculous arthritis of the knee. They have been operated upon, and their wounds have all healed without the formation of a single drop of pus. One is a woman, aged 25 years, whose limb I have amputated above the knee; three are cases of excision, aged 15, 23, and 27 years; and one is a child, three years of age, in whom I have cut away the diseased synovial membrane. They are, there- fore, typical of the varieties of operative treatment for tuber- culous arthritis, and may serve as text for a few practical observations. In a preliminary way, I would strongly emphasise the proposition that tuberculous arthritis is eminently curable. Tubercular disease, if it do not attack vital organs, generally is so. In the struggle for existence between the elemental tissues of the body and the intrusive bacillus, the latter is often worsted. The study of the conditions which favour one or the other of these antagonists is of the profoundest interest to the clinician, and, without depreciating other factors, we may take for certain that one essential, or at least invariably applicable, condition of successful treatment, so far as surgical and probably also medical forms of tubercular disease are concerned, is the enforcement of absolute rest. It would be interesting, but not germane to our present subject, to speculate on the modus operandi, and to inquire how rest, which leads to atrophy of the tissues of the body, should

XVI MEMOIR salmon fly. An artist of no mean order, interested in the study of geology and of astronomy, a successful collector of entomological specimens, his recreations were not confined to sport alone. I cannot do better than close with the words which Sir John Batty Tuke—one who spent so many holidays with him —delivered in his valedictory address as President of the Medico-Chirurgical Society:—“With John Duncan died a strong outstanding personality. It was not his professional attainments, great though they were, that gained for him pre-eminence amongst us, so much as the pure judicial quality of his mind, the independence of his character, and the manliness of his disposition. These qualities, carried into the conduct of business of whatever kind, made him the trusted adviser of all sorts and conditions of men, whether they were politicians, financiers, members of his own profes- sion, or dependents. His old gamekeeper wrote when he heard of his death :—‘ He was a noble gentleman, and the kindest of masters.' To my mind, Duncan’s walk and con- versation is well expressed in the words of a great living poet: — ‘ So walked he from his birth. In simpleness and gentleness, and honour and clean mirth.’” JOHN CHIENE.

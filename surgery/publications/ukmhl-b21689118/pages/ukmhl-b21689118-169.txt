TREATMENT OF FRESH WOUNDS 145 broken at the time of operation, but we failed to maintain the parts aseptic. Nevertheless the dressing remained unchanged for a week, and only required reapplication at long intervals. There was some increase of temperature for three or four days, and pus was found in the dressings at each inspection. It has healed soundly, though slowly. 4. Mrs VV., aet. 46.—Excision of the mamma for scirrhus was performed on loth May. In this case so much skin had to be removed that buttons with catgut had to be used. Micrococci were found in the discharges, and the dressings required renewal five or six times, but it healed quickly, and temperature never rose above 99-5°. II. In the following cases the dressing was abandoned at various dates after operation :— 1. An amputation at the ankle for severe injury of the foot. 2. Amputation at the ankle by the lateral flap, consecutive to excision of the os calcis. 3. Excision of the wrist. 4. Operation for strangulated inguinal hernia. In two of these cases. Nos. 2 and 3, we failed to correct the putrescence which existed in the tissues at the time of operation ; in the other two, although the skin was unbroken, sepsis also occurred. All did well. Having ascertained the presence of bacteria, and observing that the parts were some- what red and swollen, I introduced drainage-tubes and applied a boric poultice. In a period varying from a few days to a vv^eek these symptoms disappeared, and the dry dressing was resumed and continued, with long intervals between the renewals, until healing took place. These cases constitute, as yet, all my experience of the method. If we include the strangulated hernia, the number of important operations was— I. With perfect healing, 14, viz.,— 3 Herniotomy. 3 Amputations at ankle. 2 Amputations in forearm. K

PAIN AS A SYMPTOM OF FRACTURE* There is a want of perspective in our surgical sympto- matology. We do not formulate for each sign its precise relative value. The consequence is, that on the one hand the inexperienced fail, among a mass of unknown quantities, to draw definite conclusions; while, on the other hand, experience, gradually teaching us to single out the indica- tions which are important, tends to the formation of diagnosis upon an insufficient basis. Fractures afford an illustration of this deficient perspective. Can there be anything more unmeaning than the common division of the symptoms into equivocal and unequivocal ? What advantage is it to know that mobility is unequivocal if sometimes it does not exist at all, and at other times is present, though it cannot be recognised ? Or why call pain equivocal when sometimes it is pathognomonic, and may be the only reliable means of diagnosis ? All symptoms are equivocal under certain circumstances, unequivocal under others. The fact is, that we have in surgery a number of hereditary technicalities, which are utterly useless and may be misleading; and among the most absurd of them are such terms as true and false, equivocal and unequivocal. The result is, that we see the surgeon endeavouring to elicit crepitus when a few careful measurements might avert from his patient the most excruciating torture, or striving to detect mobility when the aspect of the limb is amply sufificient for his purpose. My present object is to give precision to our estimate of pain as a symptom of fracture. Its value has, I believe, been generally under-e.stimated, and it is certainly desirable * Reprinted from Edinburgh Medical Journal^ 1879.

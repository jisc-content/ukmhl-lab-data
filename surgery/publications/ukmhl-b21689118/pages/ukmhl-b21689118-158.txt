TREATMENT OF FRESH WOUNDS I SUPPOSE that as the recipient of discharge, as a protection from external irritants, as a means of retaining parts in contact, or for other reasons, some form of dressing is re- quired in the treatment of wounds. The ideal surgical dressing is one which, while effectually meeting these ends, requires no interference until the wound is healed. If and when this can be attained, the rapidity of healing will be de- termined simply by the vigour of the individual, and pain and anxiety will be absent from patient and surgeon. Many attempts have been made to attain this end. Mr Listerâ€™s methods keep it in view ; M. Guerin has aimed at it in his cotton-wool dressing; and Mr Gamgee has strongly supported a similar treatment. I have recently made some experiments in the same direction, using the salicylised wool introduced by Professor Thiersch. Three obstacles to a permanent dressing present them- selves. These are the sutures, the drainage, and the anti- septics. A wound cannot heal quickly unless the contact of its surfaces be reasonably close. The more accurately the edges are approximated, the more certain are they thus to heal. This accurate apposition can only be brought about by sutures. To attain, then, the object which we have in view, it is first of all necessary to have sutures which can be ab- sorbed by the tissues, and we find our wants to a great extent met by carbolised catgut. But the chief difficulty in the use of sutures undoubtedly lies in the tension to which they subject the textures. If the tissues are perfectly lax, and union by the first intention take place, the new material which * Transactions of the Medico-Chirur^cal Society, Edinburgh, \ ol. i., New Series, 1881-82.

* Reprinted from Lancet, vol. ii., 1879, by pennission of the Proprietors. AN IMPROVEMENT IN STAPHYLO- RAPHY.* There can be no doubt that the proportion of failures in staphyloraphy is considerable. Partial closure is generally accomplished, but very often a great deal remains to be done by second or third operations, and some surgeons have con- sequently recommended that the union should be brought about only little by little. Putting aside the difficulties of manipulation, which are prone to result in want of accuracy and bruising, but which care and experience suffice to overcome, the chief cause of non-union is certainly tension. In proportion to the ease with which the flaps can be brought into apposition will be the probability of success. Efforts have been made to obviate tension by long lateral incisions, by the free use of the raspatory, by division of the tensor palati and other muscles, and by osteoplasty. None of these, however, are absolutely satisfactory, because, as I believe, an important anatomical fact has been overlooked. Those who have had experience of the operation when hard and soft palate are both involved, will agree with me that the failure to unite is most apt to occur precisely at the spot where the hard palate joins the soft. Frequently a little hole remains, while all the rest behind and before it become firmly bound together, and always, or nearly alwaj s, that is the spot where separation of the edges first manifests itself I venture to think that the reason for this is the fact that the soft palate has two layers of mucous mem- brane, one of which passes forwards under the bone to form

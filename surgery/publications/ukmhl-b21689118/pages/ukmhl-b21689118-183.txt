GliRMS AND THE SPRAY 159 1. Three ounces of eucalyptol were placed in a shallow dish on the floor of an incubator. This was closed, and the temperature kept at lOo"' F. for an hour. Three three-inch beakers containing aseptic Darby’s solution were then intro- duced, uncovered, and left in the incubator at the same temperature for two days. The beakers were then covered and farther incubated, but all remained perfectly clear. 2. If the experiment be repeated, with this variation, that the eucalyptol is exposed in the incubator for five minutes only before the introduction of the beakers, then all become turbid on incubation, even though they have been exposed for only twenty minutes. 3. Six fluid ounces of eucalyptol were placed on the floor of the incubator and kept at a temperature of 60° F. for one hour before the introduction of the beakers, which were left exposed for twenty-four hours. All, three in number, became putrid. These experiments require, of course, repetition and varia- tion to arrive at exact knowledge. But we can see that the elements of time and temperature are of importance, and that a mere draught of eucalyptol vapour is not enough. It is necessary that it be given off in a certain volume, under a certain heat, and that the air be exposed to it for a certain time. In this direction, however, farther investigation is required, both as to the efficacy and innocuity of the various antiseptic vapours.

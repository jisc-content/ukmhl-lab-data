ANGIOMA 39 tive needle is made to occupy a position where it may destroy as much of the central portion of the tumour as possible, and which is consistent with sufficient nearness of the two poles. With the negative needle the surgeon then proceeds in search of the main affluents, and destroys them one after another. If there be only one or two affluents, a single operation will suffice. If there be many, or, as often happens, some are difficult to recognise, further sittings are required, I have no doubt that the best plan is to aim at the penetration of the vessel by the needle, and, if possible, through several coils ; but I have sometimes found that a satisfactory way was to use the needle so that by its lateral pressure it obliterated the pulsation of the vessel, and to keep it in that position until the vessel was thoroughly electrolysed.

II/TiMORRHOIDS 103 bowels is as injurious as constipation. Locally, the free use o cold water after the action of the bowels, and at night, is sufficient, with the other treatment, in the great majonty o cases, to obviate the necessity for operation. It is only in old and aggravated conditions that anything else is required. If operation be required, I do not believe that 1 is o much importance which you adopt. They seem to me a about equally safe; cautery, ligature, and excision. I use the cautery because it is less painful and less likely to cause re- tention of urine than ligature, and theoretically less exposed to the rare, though serious, risks of septicemia than excision. I confess, however, that I have not met with septic disaster after any of the methods of operating. In all cases the dilata- tion of the sphincter adds greatly to the ease and precision o removal. . , Before operating, it is important always to examine the parts thoroughly. I was once asked by a medical man to operate on his brother for haemorrhoids, as he was losing much blood at each motion, and I was requested to do it next day. The doctor placed his brother under chloroform before I saw him, because he was nervous. When I came to examine, and, as I always do, passed my finger up the rectum, I found malignant disease of the rectum. The situation, as may be imagined, was unpleasant. I should hesitate to operate unless I were assured of a healthy condition of the urethra. Quite recently I delayed the operation because on inquiry we found the patient had suffered from prostatic inflammation, and I found it difficult to get an instrument into the bladder. As it turned out, there was no retention when we came to operate later, but there might have been at first, with unpleasant results.

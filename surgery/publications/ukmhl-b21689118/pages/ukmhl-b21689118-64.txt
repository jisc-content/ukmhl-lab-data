ELECTROLYSIS IN ANEURISM Although I shall not discuss in detail the pathology or treatment of aneurism, and will attempt merely an apprecia- tion of the value of electrolysis therein, it is necessary in doing so to determine more or less definitely the relative importance of other means of cure. From the earliest introduction of electrolysis, the object aimed at was coagulation of the blood by electric decom- position. According to this view, there must be essential differences in the mode of action of electrolysis when applied to aneurism and other tumours. In the former, every endeavour is made to confine the action to the blood ; in the latter, the intention is to destroy tissue. In the former, it is hoped that the clot may be permanent, and even add spontaneously to its bulk. In the latter, the speedy absorption of the electrolytic products is desired. It is easy to see, therefore, that electrolysis may be effectual, useless, or dangerous in the one and not in the other, that we cannot argue from its success in erectile tumour to its success in aneurism. Klectrolysis of blood leads to coagulation : first, by primary decomposition ; next, by the secondary effect of the nascent products of decomposition ; and last, perhaps by oxidation of the positive electrode. The character of the clot, therefore, will differ at the two poles. It is found that there results at the positive pole a small, firm, black coagulum; at the negative, a large, loose, but rather sticky white or pinkish froth, and around the.se a quantity of thin tar-like fluid in which the

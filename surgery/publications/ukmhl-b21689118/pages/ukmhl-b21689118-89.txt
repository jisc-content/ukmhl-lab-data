INFLAMMATION. We all suppose ourselves capable of recognising inflam- mation when we see it, but yet there is no subject on which confusion of ideas is more prevalent. This arises chiefly from the fact that we are continually using the word in dififerent senses, and endeavouring to explain it by things which we do not understand. In common use the word is loosely applied to a combination of charactersâ€”pain, heat, redness, swelling. But these are mere symptoms which neither include everything that is inflammatory nor exclude that which is not. Neither is the combination essential, because any one of them may be omitted without destroying the identity of the disease. Clinically, such an idea is useful; pathologically, it is, of course, without value. But when we come to ask what is inflammation patho- logically, we find all sorts and kinds of opinion. One man maintains that the healing of wounds is by inflammation ; another, that these are essentially distinct, and that a wound may either be inflamed or not inflamed. One holds that only the processes which follow the action of micro-organisms are entitled to be called inflammatory ; another would extend the title to the results of a simple bruise. In short, we use the word both to describe a collection of symptoms and a pathological process, and in so far as it applies to the latter we are far from agreed on the process to which it should be applied. It is quite impossible that we should be able to determine the boundaries of inflammation until we understand the nature of life. Living things react to the influence of their environment, and inflammation has been defined as the E

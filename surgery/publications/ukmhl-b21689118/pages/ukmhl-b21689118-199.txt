WOUND TREATMENT WITHOUT THE SPRAY 1/5 endeavoured to give such particulars of the'individual cases as may, to a certain extent, enable one to judge of their value without making them unnecessarily bulky. There are some points which I should have liked to bring out more clearly. Thus, instead of the date of dismissal I should have preferred to give the day on which the wound was found healed. This i.s, of course, much earlier, as a patient is rarely sent out the moment a wound has closed. /\gain, I should have liked in each case to give the precise number of dressings , but these matters have not always been accurately recorded in the case-books. It will be seen, however, that of the fourteen amputations six, of the seven excisions two, and of the thirty-two other operations fifteen, were only dressed once. When two, three or four dressings are recorded, they were performed for the removal of the drainage-tube, for early oozing, sometimes simply from curiosity. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this infrequent dressing as adding to the safety comfort, and rapidity of healing. â€™ Four deaths have occurred. One only has connection with the mode of dressing, and I have already commented on It. The deaths from trephining, nephrectomy, and double amputation must have happened, whatever the mode of dressing. I might legitimately have added to the tables six cases of compound fracture, all of whom recovered. I claim that these cases confirm the statements made in a former paper as deductions from experiments with the spray and shovv that, from an antiseptic point of ^iew, there is no appreciable difference whether an operation be performed with or without It; and that, from every other point of view; these alterations in wound treatment are greatly for the better.

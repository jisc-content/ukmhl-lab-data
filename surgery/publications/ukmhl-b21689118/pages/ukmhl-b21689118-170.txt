TREATMENT OF FRESH WOUNHS I 46 I Amputation at wrist. I Amputation of upper arm. 3 Excision of mamma. I Excision of elbow. II. With almost perfect healing, i.e., in which dressings required renewal, although very rarely, and the general and local symptoms were absolutely good, 4, viz.,— I Amputation of thigh. I Excision of knee. I Amputation of leg. I Excision of mamma. III. In which failure occurred, i.e., the dressing was abandoned on account of inflammatory action, 4, viz.,— I Strangulated hernia. 1 Excision of wrist. 2 Amputation of ankle. Three other major operations were since performed through pre-existent sinuses, and dressed in this manner. In one, in which asepsis was maintained, the dressing required renewal several times, though at long intervals, and it was continued throughout. In the other two putrefaction con- tinued, and the dressing was temporarily abandoned. The deductions I would draw from my observations are :— I. That when we succeed in preventing sepsis at the operation we can by this method rely on singularly simple and favourable progress, with total absence of fever, with freedom from pain, and with great rapidity of healing. It is proper to be exceedingly careful in the arrestment of haemor- rhage ; but even did a little reactionary oozing occur, it is only necessary to renew the dressing once, or, as I did in some of these cases, to put on an additional layer of wool. ... II. That should sepsis lead to inflammatory action, it is necessary temporarily to abandon the dressing. III. That even in septic cases it is often advantageous to continue it throughout if there be no inflammation, or recur to it when inflammation has subsided, because it is a good excipient for discharge, because it tends to dimmish t e

ELECTROLYSIS IN ANEURISM 64 Mr Spenceâ€™s, which I have seen performed on such arteries as the femoral and brachial. The purely fusiform aneurism, wherever it exists, does not even in advanced stages lend itself readily to the formation of laminated fibrin. It is not a condition, therefore, in which either electrolysis or needling is likely to be very effective. Lleature, there can be no doubt, is here the appropriate treatment.

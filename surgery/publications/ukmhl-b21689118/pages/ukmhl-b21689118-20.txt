XU MEMOIR fession, to have men of this mould in their service. No higher object-lesson can be set to the medical under- graduates of Edinburgh, than to point the moral of the career and qualities of dear John Duncan. Requiescat in pace ! ” Duncan, with D. J. Simpson, Sir J. Y. Simpson’s eldest son, and the late Professor William Rutherford, visited Berlin and Paris in 1864-65. I remember on his return from the Continent that he brought Chassaignac’s drainage- tubes to Mr Syme. Duncan became Assistant Surgeon to the Royal Infirmary in 1868, full Surgeon in 1877, and Consulting Surgeon in 1897. He lectured on Systematic and Clinical Surgery. The following extracts from obituary notices written by old House Surgeons serve to indicate the estimate formed of Duncan by his pupils * :—“ With his physical and mental endowments, Duncan was an ideal surgeon; at the bed- side, or in the operating theatre, his fine presence and deliberate speech were eminently characteristic. He laid more stress upon knowing what was wrong and why anything should be done, than upon the mechanical details in carrying it out. As an operator he was calm, precise, deliberate, and thorough, and yet when occasion demanded, ho one could be more rapid; it might almost be said of him that he rejoiced in difficulties.” " He did not go out of his way to make his lectures popular ; he cared little about diagrams or blackboard sketches, and he never relied upon oratorical or dramatic methods to convey impressions to his audience ; he discussed rather in a subdued strain, really thinking aloud, and with a culture of diction and wealth of reasoning that made his lectures an intellectual feast.”'|' * British Medical Journal, September 9, 1899. t Mr Alexis Thomson, in Edinburgh Medical Journal, Octoljcr 1899.

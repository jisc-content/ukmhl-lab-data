6 Chester Street, PREFACE When Mr Duncan ceased to be a member of the Acting Staff of the Royal Infirmar}^, he began the preparation of a book on Clinical Surgery, in which he would have placed on record his experience, extending over nearly thirty years, as a Hospital Surgeon and Teacher. This volume contains MSS. of the proposed book, which was placed in my hands by Mr James Duncan after his father’s death, with permission to deal with it as I considered advisable. Certain portions of the MSS. are not completed, but are, it is believed, of sufficient interest to warrant their publication. I have included in the volume a selection of papers previously published, together with a biographical sketch of their late author by Professor Chiene. The publication is undertaken by the son in memory of his father. It has been my privilege to arrange the MSS. of my old teacher and valued friend, to select previously published papers, and to see the work through the press. To Mr Duncan’s pupils the book will, it is hoped, prove an instructive and useful memento of their old master ; to others it will serve to indicate the logical and philosophical line of thought of one who was an able surgeon, and who was regarded by many as the most accomplished and most scientific teacher of Clinical Surgery of his day and genera- tion.

lOO EPITHELIOMA OF THE MOUTH trouble arose from some swelling and great uselessness of the arm. The case is interesting because it was double, because the local manifestations were eradicated by operation, and as an example of ligature of both artery and vein. I know of several other patients of my own, who have survived the same operation for more than ten years, but in whom the diagnosis was not, unfortunately, verified by the microscope. Cases of Epithelioma I do not think it necessary to detail the large number of cases of epithelioma of the lip and elsewhere, in which, when recurrence took place in the glands or elsewhere, the original site remained perfectly free, and again I restrict myself only to those in whom the diagnosis was confirmed by the micro- scope. I have notes of only two such cases in which the patients remained perfectly well after ten years: one was an epithelioma of the lip, another of the back of the hand, for which amputation at the wrist was performed. In neither were glands removed. Sarcoma. I have had under my frequent personal obser\'ation (because a friend of my own) a patient on whom amputation was performed for sarcoma of the lower end of the femur more than ten years ago. The most careful microscopic examination was made. The patientâ€™s father had died of sarcoma of the innominate bone. It is not quite relevant to the matters in hand, but I should like to mention another case of sarcoma of the lower end of the femur in which amputation was performed. He died between two and three years afterwards, and at the sectio there was found a small sarcomatous tumour of the brain. Every other part was absolutely healthy. How very nearly he escaped the clutch of the disease. I have not aimed at making a long list by instituting inquiries. I have taken simply those whose subsequent

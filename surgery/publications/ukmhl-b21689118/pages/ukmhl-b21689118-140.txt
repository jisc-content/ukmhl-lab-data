ON LINEAR INCISION AND EVERTING SUTURES IN PLASTIC AND OTHER OPERATIONS* Twenty years ago I took occasion to point out that the difficulties which attend the closure of abnormal open- ings between surfaces might in some cases be overcome by an operation of splitting rather than paring. I showed, m a case of artificial anus, that the method of stripping and turning the mucous membrane towards the lumen of the bowel presented certain obvious advantages. In that way, plainly great additional thickness could be given to the textures destined to unite. There was no sacrifice of tissue. The operation opposed to the faeces the mucous membrane which normally was in contact with them. To the air the skin was presented, and to raw surface raw surface was ^^^Tt\vas evident that, if stitches were applied through the whole thickness of the wound, they would to a certain extent tend to diminish that thickness, and, what was of more im- portance, would be apt to close inaccurately the mucous membrane, or even to turn it inwards, and so material from the bowel to find its way to the rav surface. To obviate this the special suture was applied to the mucou membrane, which goes by the name of and these sutures being made of catgut were entii > ^ Curiously enough, a few months after I saw this case.

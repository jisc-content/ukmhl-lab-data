IN PLASTIC AND OTHER OPERATIONS 12 I A small orifice in the cheek from cancrum oris was also successfully cured, but these cases generally require a more extensive operation. In conclusion, let me draw attention to those cases of con- genital defect in which this operation may be properly applied, such as harelip, cleft of the soft palate, eyelid, and such like. In harelip certain precautions require to be taken. Thus the incision must be made exactly along the junction of red and white, the mucous membrane and skin. Next, to allow turning of the mucous membrane towards the mouth, it will be found useful to make a transverse incision in it low down on each side. This done, the anterq-posterior depth of the lip will be found very satisfactory, and the portion below the transverse section may be converted into a more or less effective papilla. I have applied these principles in many other cases, but the examples I have given will suffice to show that they have not inconsiderable application. The advantage of the method is that you sacrifice nothing which can by any possibility be useful, that you attain the greatest possible breadth of raw surface, and that you oppose to the natural secretions and to external influences precisely those parts which are normally in contact with them, and which are therefore best fitted to withstand their irritant action.

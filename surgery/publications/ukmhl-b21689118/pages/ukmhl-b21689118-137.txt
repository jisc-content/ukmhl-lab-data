CONCERNING THE CLOSURE OF ABNORMAL ANUS* The treatment of artificial anus has at various times at- tracted considerable attention. Till a comparatively recent date its pathology was imperfectly understood; but the recognition of the septum as the main obstacle to closure, and the methods for overcoming that obstacle adopted by Schmal- kalden, Physick, and Dupuytren, greatly elucidated the subject, and marked a very decided advance in principle and practice. Still, however, in a certain number of cases the destruction of the septum is not followed by obliteration of the abnormal orifice, and in these circumstances surgeons resort to plastic operations, of which the main characteristics are a bewildering variety and a great absence of success. I venture to add to the list yet another method, because I think it presents fewer chances of failure than any hitherto devised. It rarely falls to the lot of a surgeon to consider the treatment of a case to which such an operation may be applicable. I make no apology, therefore, for illustrating my proposal by a solitary example. It possesses at least the merit of completeness, and assuredly exhibits no undue haste on my part to anticipate the efforts of nature. The patient was a domestic servant, aet. 45, whom I was asked to see by Dr Inglis in April, 1869. She had been ill for a week before sending for Dr Inglis, and had supposed her illness to be a bilious attack, unconnected with the swelling in her left groin, as this had often previously come and gone without causing discomfort. I found it to be a femoral hernia already red, swollen, and emphysematous. * Reprinted from Lancet, vol. ii., 1873, 8y pennission of the Proprietors. H

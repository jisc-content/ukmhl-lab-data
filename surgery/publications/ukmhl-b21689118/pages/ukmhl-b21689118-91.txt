67 INFLAMMATION easy to determine, but let us recognise that such lines must be drawn for the sake of clearness, but that we must take them for what they are worth, as paper distinctions which will vary with advancing knowledge. I do not see how, with our present knowledge, we can avoid the belief that all the processes of life are similar in type, growth, development, maintenance, decay, and inflam- mation. That being understood, all disease may be divided into the teratological and the inflammatory. On the one hand we have abnormal but inherent tendencies in reference to absolute or relative growth and development, e.g., mon- strosities, innocent tumours, and such like; while on the other we have inflammation proper, which is recognised as such by all, but we have also fevers which may be designated inflammations of the blood, blood being undoubtedly a living tissue, malignant disease (probably micro - organic in its etiology), tuberculous, syphilitic, and other inflammatory pro- cesses which owe their peculiarity to the specialisation of the producing cause.

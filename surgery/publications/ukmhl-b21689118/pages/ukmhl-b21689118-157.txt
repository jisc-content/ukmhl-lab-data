LAPAROTOMY IN TUBERCULOUS PERITONITIS 133 is unfavourable. I have already referred to one example in which the operation had to be repeated several times on account of the distension, and in which, although no doubt life was prolonged, there was never the slightest tendency to recovery. I have been in the habit, when there are adhesions of the intestines to each other, to separate them gently, if they are soft and yield easily. Pockets of serous fluid are thus reached, and it is not unlikely that the fresh adhesions which must form may tend to become fibrous and have a curative influence. It does not seem that any benefit is derived from the introduction of antiseptics into the abdomen. Evidently they are not essential, and may easily prove injurious. There is considerable difference of opinion as to the propriety of drainage. I have thought that it was reasonable to keep in a tube so long as fluid came through it. It is not unlikely that moisture is favourable to the disease, and that absolute dryness of the peritoneum may in this, as in analogous cases, promote a sounder cicatrisation. It will be found that after the first four-and-twenty hours little or no fluid escapes, and thus guided, I have never found it neces.sary to retain the tube longer than a week. The only possible evil is the formation of a fistula. But in my experience the wound heals at once on the withdrawal of the tube. The cases already mentioned in which a fistula formed healed in the first place, and the fistula resulted from the slow forma- tion long afterwards of an abscess which opened through the cicatrix.

ELliCTROLYSIS IN ANEURISM 50 tissues are capable of producing inflammatory products on the surface, that from such calcareous matter no formative material can enter the clot, and that as the clot contracts it is impossible that the sac can follow its contraction or promote this by pressure. It is manifest, therefore, in relation to electrolysis, that the cure of an aortic aneurism, by blood-clot produced in the centre of the tumour and adherent only at points, is and must be doubtful, because it is not aided by inflammation, by resili- ency, or by the conditions which make for organisation. Its chance lies, therefore, in the fact that a coagulum once formed tends to increase, and, unfortunately, the coagulum produced by electrolysis is of such a nature, that it is exceedingly apt in yielding up its gas to diminish with rapidity, and so allow the re-occupation of its site by fluid blood. In aortic aneurism, therefore, it seems to me that if one aims at treating by the electrolytic production of coagulum only, it is useless to try it unless you have some legitimate hope that you can occupy by one or by quickly repeated operations practically the whole sac, so as to exclude the fluid and circulating blood. In as much as, if the aneurism be intrathoracic, it is impossible to determine, with any approach to accuracy, whether it be sufficiently sacculated, its orifice sufficiently small, and its wall sufficiently vitalised, I have always held that the role of electrolysis in thoracic aneurism was to avert or delay the tendency to death by external haemorrhage, and that the effort of the surgeon should be by long and strong electrolysis directed, as far as may be, to dam off the outer sac from the inner. I believe still that consider- ing that the method is quite innocuous, it may advantageously be thus employed. But I have for some time thought that the cases of re- ported cure of thoracic aneurism by Ciniselli, De Cristoforis, and others required further consideration. In view of the numerous failures to cure by myself and others who have followed my methods, failures which we anticipated, because we thought it unlikely that the occlusion of the extrathoracic sac could, otherwise than in rare and exceptional instances, induce a sufficient deposit secondarily in the intrathoracic

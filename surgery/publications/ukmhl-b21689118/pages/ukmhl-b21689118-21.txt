Xlll MEMOIR “ For myself, I look back upon the days of my disciple- ship with pride and affection. I more and more admire the dignity, the nobility, and the all-round effectiveness of the surgical teaching in which I was privileged to share as a pupil. To follow Duncan was to witness the constant revelation of a mind of a very high order, and the note of distinction appeared in every feature of it. I think that Duncan’s teaching was, indeed, the greatest educational influence I experienced during my course, and it has been a lasting inspiration. Over the globe are scattered many men—not all surgeons — who to the end of their days will carry the imprint of John Duncan’s personality.”* He was a candidate for the Chair of Surgery when I was appointed Professor, and I can truly say that my only regret was Duncan’s disappointment. His action was characteristic of the man ; he was the first to write and wish me success as a Professor. I cannot dwell upon the years we spent together, without one jar, without one cross word, ever helpful to each other. In help I got more than I gave, because I needed it more. Duncan, however, in any difficulty often spoke to me ; as for the help he was to me in a difficult case or in a difficult situation I cannot say how much I owe him. Cautious and not too ready to speak, his advice was pre-eminently sound and trustworthy. Duncan was the leading spirit in the Extramural School, and it was only fitting that when the teachers associated with the Royal Colleges became united as the Royal Colleges School of Medicine, he should be chosen as the first chairman of the governing body.

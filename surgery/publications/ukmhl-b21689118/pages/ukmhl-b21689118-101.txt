OSTEOMYELITIS 77 old days was so fatal, at once arrested the disease by simple incision. I am not sure that we quite understand its success, because the septic organisms are already there. But it is successful. Not always, however, because the disease is not always limited to the periosteum. It may have already attacked the medulla, and the difficulty I have felt is so to distinguish as to be able to say in this case we must go farther and open the medulla, in that we may be content with periosteal incision. Of course if, having assured our- selves by the local signs of inflammation and otherwise that there is septic ostitis, we find merely oedema of the periosteum on incision, we are bound to go farther. But in the very early stage the attack may be periosteal and yet pus not have had time to form. An early whitlow is a good example. But even in so deeply placed a bone as the femur the same may be found. A lad, aet. i8, had a severe rigor and high fever, and was brought into my ward with intense tenderness and a little swelling of the lower third of the femur. I incised, and found merely a little opaque serum, but the fever immediately subsided, and the wound healed without even a scale of necrosis. Later, I think we may to a certain extent be guided by the sequence of symptoms. If the pain is exceedingly severe, and the general symptoms serious, while the swelling is at first slight, we may conclude that the focus of disease is medullary.

CLASSIFICATION OF ULCERS. My experience as teacher and examiner leads me to believe that the usual tendency to neglect common things and devote attention to the rare and curious, is strikingly illustrated by the want of knowledge which students display of the appearance and treatment of that most common of surgical diseases, an ulcer. This want of knowledge is aggravated by the fact that the text-book descriptions are often dogmatically typical, and their classifications confused or illogical. , u ^ It ought to be understood, on the one hand, that a complete natural classification is. from the complexity of the problem, practically impossible; and on the other, that none can be regarded as satisfactory in which some ulcers are arranged on an etiological, others on a macroscopic, and yet others on a microscopic basis. We must try to avoid the condition of dermatology in general, which has suffered much from the man in the street having set himself up as a scientific nomenclator. Names and tradition, when old and established, ought to be accepted. We must not, however, accept them for more than they are worth, or suppose them to be scientifically accurate, when very likely they are expressions of a byegone pathology. Let me say a few words to you, then, in the first place, as to how you maj so arrange things in your mind that you shail be abie to appiy your knowledge to particular specimens when they may come Nov^you may look at ulcers from the purely phenomenal point of view and classify according to appearances, or you may investigate causes and classify etiologically.

HAEMORRHOIDS As in so many similar affections, the cause of piles lies in an alteration of the relationship between the downward pressure and the power to support it. The pressure may be excessive or the tissues weak and lax. The result is stretch- ing of the tissues affected. Now, all pressure, according to its amount and continuousness, leads to inflammation. If moderate and intermittent, hypertrophy results; if moderate but continuous, atrophy; if severe, an inflammation results, which may even be suppuration and destruction. In hsemor- rhoids we have all. In the persistent thickened tags of ex- ternal haemorrhoids we see the hypertrophy. The atrophic in- flammation from tension is well seen in the ulceration which so often covers an internal pile, gives it a strawberry look, and causes haemorrhage when the bowels act. This ulceration is precisely analogous to that over an aneurism about to burst, or a tumour pressing on the skin. In all, when a certain thinness is reached, the ulcer begins on the outside, with desquamation of the cuticle, and gradually eats inwards. The more acute forms of inflammation are produced by rapid increase of the persistent causes or accidental incidence of external courses of irritation, and give rise to the well-known phenomena of a “ fit of piles.” In treatment, then, the etiology must be followed. ^ ou take off the pressure. In this respect the effect of lest in the horizontal position has scarcely been sufficiently valued. It is essential in the “ fit ” and for haemorrhage. But it is not to be neglected in the initial treatment of all cases. The treatment of the liver, the bowels, and so on, is well understood, but it must not be forgotten that a loose or frequent action of the

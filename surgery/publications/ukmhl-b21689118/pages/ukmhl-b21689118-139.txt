THE CLOSURE OF ABNORMAL ANUS II5 the abnormal orifice for more than half an inch, invaginated it, and sewed the raw surfaces together by six points of in- terrupted catgut suture, which were then cut short. I next pared freely the margin of the skin, and brought it together by means of silver wire. During the after-treatment the parts were relaxed by keeping the thigh flexed. The diet was restricted to milk with lime-water. On the eighth day, finding the wound entirely united, I removed the stitches. A little froth issued from the small openings left by the removal of a corner stitch. These openings remained patent for some weeks, notwith- standing the use of the hot wire. Nothing but gas, however, escaped from them, and they ultimately soundly healed. The patient remains in every respect perfectly well, and it is now a year since the closure was effected. Such an operation is, of course, only possible when the artificial anus is of large size; but it is precisely in these cases that other methods are least successful. The advantages which I claim for it are, that it presents to the feces the normal mucous surface of the bowel, that it diminishes the strain upon the stitches, and that it largely increases the depth of raw surface, by the adhesion of which the pressure from within is to be resisted. It seems to me theoretically sound, and in this case, at least, was practically successful.

GERMS AND THE SPRAY It is curious to speculate on the fate of Listerism had our knowledge been formerly as it is now. How would these methods have been received had we known that under anti- septic dressings organisms may flourish while the follows what has been called an aseptic course ; that a suppurations of an acute character, and some of a chronic, are attended by microbia although unexposed to the air ; that the injection of an aseptic fluid may induce septicaemia ; that contamination of a wound through the atmosphere is comparatively unimportant, while the means taken to prevent it are inefficient? On this last point I have made a few investigations, which I desire to lay before you. A few years ago I began an attempt to discover the percentage which remained aseptic of cases in which major operations were performed when the skin was previous > sound. I have found it by no means an easy task. It is plainly impossible to tru.st such tests as the odour of the discharge or the discoloration of the protective oiled silk because they may be absent while organisms are presen and may be produced by other causes than bacteria^ Sear with the microscope and cultivation of the d-harges^ n aseotic fluids appear the most reliable methods, and been diligently put in operation. Even they not absolutely satisfactory, because they ar p ^ contradictory results.

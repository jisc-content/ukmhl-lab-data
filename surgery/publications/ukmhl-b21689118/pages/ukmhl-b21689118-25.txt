ANGIOMA. Probably the most elastic and comprehensive classifica- tion of the angiomata is the anatomical. Undoubtedly the varieties run into one another, but typically, and in practice, they are perfectly distinct. I should divide thus :— Capillary . Angioma • Venous . . Arterial. . Lymphatic Cavernous Tumourl Erectile Tumour jTelang.ectasis. Phlebectasis. Cirsoid Aneurism. Lymphangioma. Of these the second and third generally retain their original characters, but the first has undoubtedly a certain tendency to extend backwards to the arteries, or forward to the veins. Capillary A ngioma. The capillary angioma is best considered under two heads—the Congenital and the Non-congenital. Surgeons and pathologists, indeed, have constantly described these two forms of telangiectasis as one, and have too much ignored the many points of distinction in their histology, clinical hi.story, and treatment. I shall take them separately. Ncevus. Congenital Telangiectasis. — This may be sub- divided in two ways, according as it is regarded from the purely pathological, or from the clinical point of view. On the one hand, we have the simple, the venous, and the arterial na;vus ; on the other, the cutaneous, the subcutaneous, and the mixed. We shall presently see the value of these distinctions. A

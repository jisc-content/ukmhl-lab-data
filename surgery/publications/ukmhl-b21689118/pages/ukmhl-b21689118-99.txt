OSTEOMYELITIS. E. F., a little girl aged ii years, was sent into the Medical House in February 1891, suffering, as was supposed, from rheumatic fever. The diagnosis thought at first probable in the medical wards was acute tuberculosis with the chief incidence on the cerebral meninges. After a few days, however, swelling appeared about the left shoulder, and she was transferred immediately to my ward. I incised, found the upper part of the humerus surrounded by pus, opened the medullary cavity, and discovered that it was studded with foci of yellow - green inspissated pus, which extended throughout nearly the whole length of the bone. I chiselled away the roof of the medullary cavity and scraped away the whole interior. After a long illness the patient got well, but not without two farther operations for the removal of small portions of necrosed bone. One feature of this case is that no immediate cause for the attack could be discovered. That some breach of surface affords a mode of entrance for the staphylococcus is certain, but in the majority of cases no special local inflammation indicates that the open door has been a decayed tooth, a scratch, or an internal ulceration. Very constantly, however, the attack is referred to exposure or injury. Most curiously, I had at one and the same time in my wards two little boys with osteomyelitis of the tibia. The history was almost identical. Each had spent with his parents a long and happy day on the seashoreâ€”one at Musselburgh, the other at Portobello. The next day both were exceedingly ill, and with the local signs of ostitis of the tibia. A blow or a second blow on the same site

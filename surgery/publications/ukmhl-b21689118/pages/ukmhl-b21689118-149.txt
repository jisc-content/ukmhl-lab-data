ON LAPAROTOMY IN TUBERCULOUS PERITONITIS* The extension of laparotomy to the treatment of tuberculous peritonitis has of late excited interest, and in many hands has been attended by success. My own experience extends to 21 cases, seen chiefly in Dr Affleckâ€™s wards, but also in other wards and in private practice. Of these, one died two years after the first operation, the abdomen having been reopened several times to relieve tension. In three, the abdomen, when last seen, was still somewhat swollen and resistant; one patient, mt. 28, returned on account of localised abscess in the neighbourhood of the wound ; and one, ret. 5, with a faecal fistula; while another, aet. 6, has recently come to the Infirmary to be treated foi tuberculous elbow, with the abdomen perfectly well. The others recovered to all appearance completely, and have remained well for varying periods up to four years. As is the case with hospital patients, many in the end have been lo.st sight of As a contribution to the statistics of the operation, these cases are of little value, but I have found them useful individually, and collectively they indicate that my experi- ence of the operation has been favourable. I draw upon this experience in the following remarks. This mode of treatment is perhaps not the less interest- ing because its discovery was purely tortuitous, the result of errors in diagnosis and of the performance of exploratory incisions. My own attention, indeed, was attracted by having to perform laparotomy in 2 cases for acute obstruction, in which it was found that the obstruction was due to tuberculous peritonitis of old standing. One died, but the other was * Reprinted irom Edinburgh Hospital Reports, vol. iv., 1896.

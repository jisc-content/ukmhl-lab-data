WOUND TREATMENT WITHOUT THE SPRAY * Two years ago I brought before this Society what I thought to be strong arguments in favour of the substitution of cotton wool impregnated with a non-volatile antiseptic for the carbolic gauze commonly in use in the treatment of recent wounds. A year ago I related also to this Society a series of experiments which led me to believe that the spray of carbolic acid was useful only in so far as it threw a germicide solution on a wound, that it had no effect whatever in rendering the atmosphere aseptic. As, therefore, the spraj' is not only inconvenient but also useless, it has been entirel}" abandoned in the wards under my care, and I desire to-night to lay before you a record of my surgical experience since I carried these changes into effect.f But first I wish to make a retraction. In one of these papers I spoke, although guardedly, of the possibility of giving up also the use of drainage-tubes, and 1 mentioned instances of amputation below the knee, at the ankle, and in the forearm, besides one or two other operations m which this had been done with complete success. I have since had further experience of a similar kind. Take one case out of several. A short time ago a girl was brought to the Infirmary suffering from compound fracture sustained in a steam laundry. I amputated the forearm a short distance below the elbow, as well as the tips of three fingers on the other hand.

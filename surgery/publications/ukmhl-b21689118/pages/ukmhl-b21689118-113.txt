EPITHELIOMA OF THE MOUTPI With Observations on the Etiology of Malignant Disease. The ulcers with which epithelioma is most apt to be con- founded are the syphilitic, the tuberculous, and the simple inflammatory. A. B., aet. 46, was admitted to the Infirmary for the purpose of undergoing an operation for epithelioma. A large, ragged sore occupied the right angle of the mouth, and had led to considerable destruction of tissue. Thence it passed to the alveolus of the upper jaw, where the only remaining molar tooth was embedded in a mass of granula- tions, and still further it stretched over the roof of the mouth as far as the soft palate. A doubt as to its malignant character was excited by its situation. When the contour of the closed lips was surveyed the ulcer appeared to extend over an equal area of the upper and the lower, but when the mouth was opened it became evident that the chief extension of the disease was upwards, and the patient very distinctly states that it commenced above the angle. Now I have never met with a case of epithelioma of the upper lip properly so called. It may extend to the upper lip, it does not commence there. You see it on the inner surface of the cheek, especially opposite the molars, where irritation from jagged points is frequent. You .see it on the skin of the lip, as, for example, at the angle of the nose, or where moles or warts have preceded it, but, what- ever be the explanation, the fact remains that it is ex- ceedingly rare where skin and mucous membrane join to form the upper lip.

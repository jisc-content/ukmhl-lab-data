499 OF THE TONSII.S. SECTION IV. OF THE TONSILS. The tonsils are grey-coloured soft glands, somewhat of an oval shape, and commonly about the size of an almond, with several openings on the surface, leading into cells within the substance of the glands, which are lined by the membrane of the mouth. In the healthy state, the tonsils secrete a transparent mu- cus, which assumes a white colour in inflammatory cases, giving the appearance of a slough. An inflammation of the tonsils is accompanied by swelling, which obstructs the breath- ing and swallowing, and may often be removed, by applying to the inflamed part, (as was recommended by my father), a leech included in a box, in which there is a slit near to its extre- mity, through which the animal applies its mouth to the in- flamed tonsils. Concretions similar to those in the salivary glands have been sometimes found within the tonsils *. There are a great number of small mucous glands on the back of the tongue, velum pendulum palati, uvula, and in the vicinity of the tonsils. SECTION V. OF THE TONGUE. The Tongue is not only an organ of taste and speech, but also constitutes a part of the organs of deglutition. It is firmly supported by the bone called Os Hyoides. The tongue has been said sometimes to be awanting, and sometimes it is of so large a size as to create indistinct articu- lation. Tkioen has made mention of a case, in which the tongue was â€œ circiter quatuor pollices longa, ore cu- jus rictum omni modo implet, mento dependeat inferius, eamque argentea theca, oneris causa, adfabre concinnata Vide my Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomach, and Intestines. i i 2

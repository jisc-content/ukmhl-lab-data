61 OF DEFORMITY OF THE SPINE. In calculating the force exerted by the muscles which move the spine, allowance is to be made for the action of the carti- lages between the vertebrae, which, in every motion from an erect posture, must be stretched on one side, and compres- sed on the other, to both which they resist; whereas, in rai- sin- the trunk, these cartilages assist by their elasticity. Owing to the compressibility of the intervertebral carti- lages we lose our stature during the day, and regain it during the night, when the weight of the body is taken off the spine. The different articulations of the vertebrae admit of more extensive motion forwards than backwards, which is of less use, and might have tended to overstretch the bloodvessels, which are contiguous to the bodies of the vertebrae. Each vertebra at the period of birth consists of a body, a long crooked bone on each side, which forms a small share of the bony bridge, which is completed by the oblique processes, the beginning transverse processes, and the oblique plate, but no spinal processes, so that the teguments are in no danger of being hurt by the sharp end of these while a child is in its bended posture in the womb, nor during labour. Causes of Deformity of the Spine. A deformity of the spine may be occasioned by the une- qual thickness of the intervertebral substances; thus the spine is thrown off its balance, it inclines to one side, and the inter- vertebral substances are much compressed on that side, from sustaining the greater share of the weight of the body. An inequality as to the thickness of the opposite sides of the intervertebral substance, may arise from the bad habit of inclining the body to one side, from palsy, or spasm of the ex- terior muscles of one side of the trunk of the body. When there is a curvature, a second turn, but in an oppo- site direction to the former, must be formed, because the mus- cles on the convex side of the spine being stretched, contract powerfully, and the patient makes an effort to keep the cen- tre of gravity of the body perpendicular to its base, that the muscles may be relieved from a constant contractile state, which is a source of uneasiness : hence the spine assumes the

ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. 290 Of the Os Cuneiforme Externum. The Os Cuneiforme Externum is broad and flat above., with long sides running obliquely downwards, and terminat- ing in a sharp edge. The upper surface of this bone is an oblong square. The surface behind is nearly a triangle, but not complete at the inferior angle, and is joined to the os navicu- lare. The external side is an oblong square divided as it were by a diagonal; the upper half of it is smooth, for its con- junction with the os cuboides: The other is a scabrous hol- low, and in its superior anterior angle, a small smooth impres- sion is made by the os metatarsi of the toe next to the little One. The internal side of this bone is also quadrangular, with the fore-part of its edge made flat and smooth by the os metatarsi of the toe next to the great one, and the back-part is also flat and smooth where the os cuneiforme medium is contiguous to it. The fore-part of this bone is an oblong tri- angle, for sustaining the os metatarsi of the middle toe. Of the Os Cuneiforme Medium. The Os Cuneiforme Medium, or Minimum, is square above: its internal side has a flat smooth surface above and behind, for its conjunction with the following bone; with a small rough fossa below; and a considerable share of it is roue'b and hollow. The external side is smooth and a little O hollowed, where it is contiguous to the last described bone. This bone is triangular behind, where it is articulated with the os naviculare; and it is also triangular at its fore part, where it is contiguous to the os metatarsi of the toe next to the great one. Of the Os Cuneiforme Internum. The OS Cuneiforme Maximum, or Internum, is situ- ated more obliquely than the two other cuneiform bones. Besides, its broad thick part is placed below, and the small thin point is above and outwards; while its under broad surface is concave, for allowing a safe passage to the flexors of the great toe. The surface of this os cuneiforme be-

508 elements of anatomy. Those stones which sometimes are found within the ducts of the larger Salivary Glands, are of a white colour, and of different sizes; and, according to Fourcroy and Vauquelin*, consist of phosphat of lime, united to a membranous substance. SECTION VII. OF THE PHARYNX AND GUI.LET. Of the Pharynx. The Pharynx, a musculo-membranaceous extensible sac, is placed nearly in a line drawn through the middle of the body, and is connected by a loose band of cellular substance with the anterior part of the vertebras of the neck. In form, it has been compared to an elongated funnel, but the simile is not quite accurate, as it varies in breadth. The upper part of the pharynx is equal to the distance between the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone: behind the thy- roid cartilage it is somewhat larger, from which place it is gra- dually contracted as it descends .; so that it resembles a funnel. The pharynx is firmly connected to the basilar process of the occipital and sphenoid bone above: laterally it is bounded by the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone, the cornua of the os hyoides, the carotid arteries, jugular veins, and pa- ria vaga of the 8th pair of nerves ; and nearly opposite to the fifth vertebra of the neck and under part of the cricoid carti- lage of the larynx, the gullet takes its origin from it. The pharynx, the medium through which the air passes into the lungs and the food into the gullet, communicates with the following parts, which may be readily seen by open- ing it from behind, after having removed the vertebrae ot the neck. By such a view, the oval-shaped cavities which com- municate with the back of the neck are seen, the trumpet- shaped opening of the Eustachian tube, which is bordered by cartilage, and hence always kept open; the soft palate, with the isthmus faucium under it.

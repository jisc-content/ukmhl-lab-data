OF THE THUMB. 265 I do not recollect to have seen an instance of the simple dislocation at the carpus. Sir A. Cooper has made mention of such a dislocation accompanied by fracture of the radius. The fractured end of that bone was thrown backwards with the os scaphoides upon the carpus. The compound dislocation is by no means rare, in consequence of the bursting of muskets.

These nodes are to the touch harder than the swelling occasioned by rheumatism, and do not occasion inflamma- tion or fever, and there is no pink-coloured sediment in the urine, as often is observed in the rheumatic and gouty. SECTION II. OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. The length and strength of the Inferior Extremities distin- guish man from all the inferior animals; and have a reference to his erect position. The inferior extremities have commonly been divided into three parts, viz. the thigh, leg, and foot. Of the Thigh-Bone. The Thigh-Bone is the longest of the bones of the body, measuring in most men between fifteen and seven- teen inches, and has generally been enumerated among the bones which, in their form, bear some resemblance to a

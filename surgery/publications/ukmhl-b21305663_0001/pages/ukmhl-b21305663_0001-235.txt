189 01-' THE SKULL. arid backward from the frontal bone. This pressure must have been begun in early infancy, and continued for the whole time during which the bones were yielding and flexible. The consequence is, that the os frontis is depressed almost to an angle of eight or ten degrees. The parietal bones are crushed down in a similar manner, and brought as nearly as possible to a level surface. In two of the skulls the coronal and samttal sutures are much less distinct than common, and iu some parts almost obliterated. The most evident effect of this violence to the cranium is the protrusion of the parietal bones behind the ears, to make room for the squeezed and displaced brain. This is such as to impart to the head a deformed, mon- strous, or rickety appearance. It is understood, that the mechanical power thus applied to the head, widens or enlarges its base as well as its summit.- The individuals who undergo the operation are children of the more considerable and important families. The lower and plebeian orders are not honoured with the distinction offiat heads. Such a skull, of the rounded form, which nature gave it accompanies the others, and makes a striking contrast *. In short, from what has been stated, the conclusion seems to- me legitimate, that the external table of the skull does not corres- pond in its course with the internal one; it bears the obvious impressions of the actions of the muscles fixed to it, and even, in some skulls, of the transverse wrinkles of the forehead,— of the effects of compression, as in the Carib and some of the American Indian skulls,—of external violence, as in the skulls of the natives of New South Wales, and Van Dieman’s Land,—of the original centres of ossification of the compo- nent bones of the skull, as well as traces of the particular form of the features of the countenance. But the internal table is an exact mould of the surface of the dura mater of the brain. Vide American Journals.

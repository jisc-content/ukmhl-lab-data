elements of anatomy. 214- Of the Third or Mongolian Class. Tiiis class includes the Mongols, Calmucks, Burats, the Chinese, Japanese, the inhabitants of Thibet, Cochin China, Ava, and the various tribes of the Esldmaux. Pallas has given an excellent account of the Mongols and Calmucks,* and of the inhabitants of Siberia. The head is of a square form, the forehead rather low, the bones of the face are large and broad, especially the cheek bones, the nose is broad at its root, but small and flat, and the chin prominent; the cheeks are round and prominent, lips thick and large, the ears are large; eyes black and placed ob- liquely, depressed towards the nose, and the internal angle of the eye is rounded. There is considerable variety as to the form of head of this great class; for instance, the skull of the Burat child repre- sented by Blumenbach is globular, the bones of the face are broad, and seem as if they had been flattened, and the orbits are large. Many of the characters of the Esldmaux, correspond with the Mongolian class ; and, therefore, I shall now describe that ■remarkable tribe, that are so widely diffused over the northern coast of America. My description of the Eskimaux skull has been derived from six specimens in my own museum, for three of which I am indebted to Mr Edwards, who accompanied Captain Lyon, and for one to Mr Fisher, who accompanied Captain Parry. These skulls were found at different places ; two at Repulse Bay, one at Winter Island, Lat. 66., Long. 83.; and an- other at Iglulick, Lat. 69., Long. 83. All these skulls are lighter than the Negro skull. The two found at Repulse Bay differ from all the others; they more nearly resemble the European skull, and indeed, one of these more nearly * See a good figure of the Skull of .a Calmuck in Sandifort’s Mus.

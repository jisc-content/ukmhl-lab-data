XXXV11 PREFACE. Part VI. relates to the Nervous System, in which I have endeavoured to give an explanation of the Structure of the Brain and Nerves in Man, and many of the inferior animals, interspersed with various ob- servations, which have been deduced from experi- ments made by myself, or from the phenomena of dis- ease. I have inserted my Fatherâ€™s observations on his discovery of the communication between the lateral ventricles of the brain, and various pathological obser- vations upon that subject, which have never been pub- lished; and also his remarks respecting the fourth ventricle and spinal cord. From the works of Vieussens, Malpighi, Reill, Albinus, my Father, Prochaska, Sir E. Home, the Wenzels, Wilson Philip, C. Bell, Lobstein, Bock, Weber, Walter, Wutzer, Lobstein, Scemmering, Lawrence, Tiede- mann, Serres, Swan, Rolando, Flourens, Greding, Haslain, Pinel, Vauquelin, The- nard, &c. many observations and details respecting the Structure and Functions of the Brain and Ner- vous System, have been extracted. In describing the Organs of the Senses, many ob- servations are introduced upon the Physiology and Pathology of these organs. In treating of the different Senses much addi- tional matter has been given. In describing the Nose, notice has been taken of the late experiments of Majendie, and of the ex- traction of polypi from that organ. In describing the Eye, I have inserted the more recent remarks by Hr Knox, and by my late pupil, Hr Jacob of Hublin.

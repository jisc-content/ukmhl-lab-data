MUSCLES OE THE HAND. 437 Epitrochlo-Metacarpeus, or Flexor Carpi Radialis. This muscle, which is placed immediately beneath the fas- cia, proceeds from the internal condyle of the os humeri, and from the fore and upper part of the ulna : its long tendon passes through the fossa of the os trapezium, and is inserted into the fore and upper part of the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger. Bv this muscle the wrist is not only bent, but the hand is thrown into a state of pronation. Epitrochlo-Ca? palis, or Flexor Carpi Ulnar is. This muscle takes its origin from the fascia of the fore- arm, from the internal condyle of the os humeri, and from the inner side of the olecranon ulnae. It passes along the in- ner side of the ulna, between the extensor carpi ulnaris at the back of the arm, and the flexor sublimis in the front of it, and is inserted into the os pisiforme. This muscle assists the former. Humero-Super-Carpeus, or Extensor Carpi Longior. This muscle arises immediately below the supinator radii longus, from the ridge above the external condyle of the os humeri. It passes along the radius, under the extensor mus- cles of the thumb, and its tendon is fixed down by the liga- mentum carpi annulare, and is fixed into the upper and back part of the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger. Epicondylo-Super-Metacarpeus, or Extensor Carpi Brevior. The origin of this muscle is similar to that of the former, excepting that a few of its fibres are also connected with the capsular ligament of the joint; its tendon also passes under the annular ligament in the same groove with that of the for- mer muscle; and is inserted into the upper and back part of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. The two last named muscles extend the wrist.

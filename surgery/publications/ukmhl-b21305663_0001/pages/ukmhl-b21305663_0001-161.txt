OF THE STERNUM. 115 Sternum. The sternum *, or breast-bone, is a flat bone and pile of bones: it varies considerably as to breadth in different persons, and is placed at the fore part of the thorax. In adults of a middle age, it is composed of three bones, which may be easily separated from each other after the cartilages connecting them are destroyed. There are a few exceptions to this ob- servation, for I have seen the middle portion of the sternum composed in the adult of three pieces, and the lowest piece split into two in a longitudinal direction. Frequently the two lower bones are found intimately united ; and very often, in old people, the sternum is a continued bony substance from one end to the other; and with two, sometimes three, transverse lines on its surface; which are marks of the former divisions. The sternum is broad and thick above, and becomes smaller as it descends. The internal surface of this bone is somewhat hollowed, for enlarging the thorax; but the convexity on the external surface is not so conspicuous, because the sides are pressed outwards by the true ribs; the cartilages of which are received into seven smooth pits, formed in each side of the sternum, and are kept firm there by strong liga- ments, which, on the external surface, have a particular radia- ted texture -f*. The pits at the upper part of the sternum are at the greatest distance one from another, and, as they de- scend, are nearer; so that the two lowest are contiguous. This bone is covered by skin, and by the aponeuroses of the great pectoral and sterno-mastoid muscles. The breastbone is cellular, and covered by a very thin external plate, especially on its internal surface, where we may frequently observe a cartilaginous crust spread over it Hence it is rarely broken. * Os Pectoris, ensiforme, scutum cordis. | Rurscn, Catalog.

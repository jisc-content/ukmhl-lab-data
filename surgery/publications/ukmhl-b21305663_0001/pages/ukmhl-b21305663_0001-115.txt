OF THE VERTEBRiE. 69 \,ra had so far lost its support, that, under different inclinations of the head, it required great care to prevent the spinal mar- row from being compressed by it, and as he could not depend upon the actions of the muscles of the neck, he therefore used his hands to support the head during different motions and positions.‚Äù In new-born children, the lateral pieces only of this verte- bra are ossified ; the arch, which it has at its forepart instead of a body, being cartilaginous. Second Vertebra, or Vertebra dentata. The body of this vertebra is somewhat of a pyramidal fi- gure, being large, and produced downwards, especially at its fore-side, to enter into a hollow of the vertebra below ; while the upper part has a square process, with a small point stand- ing out from it, somewhat resembling a tooth, and hence the name vertebra dentata. The side of this process on which the hollow of the anterior arch of the first vertebra plays, is con- vex, smooth, and covered with a cartilage ; and it is of the same form behind, for the ligament, which is extended trans- versely from one rough protuberance of the first vertebra to the other, and is cartilaginous in the middle, to move on it. A ligament likewise goes out in an oblique transverse di- rection, from each side of the processus dentatus, to be fixed at its other end to the first vertebra, and to the occipital bone; and another ligament rises up from near the point of the pro- cess to near the os occipitis. The superior oblique processes of this vertebra dentata are large, circular, very nearly in an horizontal position, and slightly convex, to be adapted to the inferior oblique pro- cesses of the first vertebra. The inferior oblique processes of this vertebra dentata, are similar to those of all the cervical vertebrae. The transverse processes of the vertebra dentata are short, very little hollowed at their upper part, and not forked at then- ends ; and the canals through which the cervical arteries pass, are reflected outwards about the middle of each process ; so that the course of these vessels may be directed towards the

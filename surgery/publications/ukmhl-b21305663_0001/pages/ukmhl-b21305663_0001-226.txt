ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. T8Cr change its situation from the cavity to the tubercle, and to return again ; while the common ligament of the articulation affords space enough for such a change of place backwards and forwards : but like other ligaments of the joints by gin- glimus, is strong and short at the sides, to confine the lateral motion s.- When therefore the teeth of both jaws are in contact, the condyles- are lodged securely in the temporal cavities, but the lateral motions must be confined both by the firmness of the ligamfents, and the rising brims on each side of the cavities. When the jaw is brought directly forwards* the condyle and intermediate cartilages descend and advance forwards upon the- tubercles. In this situation the lateral motions are a little more free, owing .to the. want of rising brims to stop the con- dyles. When the fore-teeth of the lower jaw are moved forwards, and to one-side, the condyle of the opposite side is either ad- vanced from the cavity to the tubercle, while the condyle of the same side remains in the cavity ; or if both condyles are on the tubercles, when t!>e jaw is moved obliquely to one side, the condyle of the side to which the motion is made, slides back from the tubercle to the cavity* When the mouth, is opened by the descent of the lower jaw, the fore-part of it, where the depressing muscles are fixed, is drawn backwards, as well as downwards, while resistance is made to the angles moving backwards by the masseter and internal pterygoid muscles, and, at the same time, the external pterygoid muscles draw the condyles and their moveable cartilages forwards- there- fore, when the mouth is opened, the condyles are carried forwards upon the tubercles, and the axis of motion of the bone is a little above its angles. But in this situation there is less resistance, than in any other, to the condyles slipping forwards ; which seldom happens, except in yawning exces- sively, or when a blow is received upon the jaw when the mouth has been opened. Sir A. Coover has described the partial dislocation of the under jaw, and also the subluxation: in the former, the dislocation of one of the condyles takes place, and the chin is

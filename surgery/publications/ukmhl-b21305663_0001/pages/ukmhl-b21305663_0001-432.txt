It arises from the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, side of the pharynx, and from the space between the last grinder and coronoid process of the lower jaw. The fibres of the muscle are transverse in respect to the face; and they terminate in the orbicularis muscle in the corner of the mouth. This muscle draws the angle of the mouth backwards, and corrugates the cheek; hence is employed in expelling the con- tents of the mouth, or in blowing wind instruments; and it is also employed in pressing the cheek inwards, and in putting alimentary substances between the teeth. Muscles of the Palate. These are described together, with the other parts of the palate. DISPOSITION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FORE-PART OF THE neck:. First Layer. Upon removing the skin and cellular substance of the fore- part of the neck, a thin tendinous membrane presents itself, which is the continuation of the same fascia which covers the muscles of the abdomen. This fascia ascends upon the face, and is slightly connected with the base of the under jaw; and it is ultimately inserted into the zygoma and mastoid process of the temporal bone. There is a thin and broad muscle, which covers the greater part of the side and fore-part of the neck ; a part of the side of the face; and a portion of the up- per part of the chest; and which has been named Platysma Myoides. Under this tendinous fascia the fibres of this muscle, in a robust subject, are conspicuous; but in the aged and thin, it is composed of very thin and pale fibres, which are disposed ir- regularly over the side of the neck. The fibres of this mus- cle pass obliquely upwards, and are lost upon the side of the face.

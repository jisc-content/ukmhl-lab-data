ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 348 a ratio to the strength of the muscle ; for the muscles are in- vigorated, become denser and larger by use, and acquire greater force and energy. This truth is also strongly exem- plified, by comparing the same muscles in wild and domestic birds. It is proper also to add, that the muscles of some men, are originally much firmer and stronger, than those of most men, hence the former are much stronger than the latter, even though not invigorated by use. The former are hard, red coloured, fibrous, tough, and strong smelling ; the latter are soft, white, and delicate. The form of the different muscles is very various ; being modified and adapted to their particu- lar office, as it is a law in the animal economy, that a muscle always contracts towards its centre. The same muscle in dif- ferent persons, is not only larger, but of different lengths in men of the same stature : which is a part of original forma- tion ; thus the quantity of contraction is diminished, and the velocity consequently increased in a very considerable de- gree. The larger fibres of the muscles may be subdivided into â€¢smaller fibres. Leewenhoek, whose microscopical observa- tions were so celebrated, supposed he had discovered the ulti- mate division of a muscle, and calculates, that in the fibres of some muscles there are 3200 filaments. The ultimate fila- ments have been said to be solid *, hollow -f-, or vesicular +. To me the smaller fibres seem to be solid, and perfectly simi- lar to the larger. The smaller fibres of a muscle are united by cellular sub- stance and fat. Of the coverings of Muscle. The muscles are covered by cellular membrane and fat, which, together with the serous fluid which is proper to the cellular membrane, renders our movements more ready and easy. * Gottskhed.

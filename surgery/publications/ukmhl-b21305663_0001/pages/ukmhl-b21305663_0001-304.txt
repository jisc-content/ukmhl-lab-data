ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 258 back-part, from which it has got its name. Above, its surface is smooth, slightly hollowed, and semicircular, for its conjunc- tion with the os scaphoides. Its external side is an oblong concave square, for receiving the following bone. The inferior surface is formed into a pulley, on which the first bone of the thumb is moved. On the outer side of the external protuberance, a small oblong smooth surface is formed by the os metacarpi indicis. The fore-part of the trapezium is prominent in the palm, and, near to the external side, has a sinuosity in it, for the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis ; on the ligamentous sheath of which the tendon of the flexor tertii internodii pollicis plays : And still more externally the bone is scabrous, for the connection of the transverse ligament of the wrist. The ab- ductor and flexor primi internodii pollicis have their origin from this part of the bone, and ligaments pass from it to the first bone of the thumb. Of the Os Trapezoides. The Os Trapezoides, so called from the irregular quadran- gular figure of its back part, is the smallest bone of the wrist, except the pisiforme. The figure of it is an irregular cube. It has a small hollow surface above, by which it joins the scaphoides ; a long convex one internally, where it is contigu- ous to the trapezium ; a small external one, for its conjunc- tion with the os magnum ; and an inferior convex surface, the edges of which are, however, so much raised before and be- hind, as to form a sort of pulley, where it sustains the os me- tacarpi indicis. Of the Os Magnum. The Os Magnum, so called, because it is the largest bone of the carpus, is oblong, having four quadrangular sides, with a round upper end, and a triangular plain one below. The round head is divided by a small rising, opposite to the connection of the os scaphoides and lunare, which toge-

362 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. ly, diagonal motion is produced, the tendons of the muscles pulling in the direction of the sides of a parallelogram; for example, the head is drawn downwards in the diagonal by the combined action of the sterno-cleido-mastoidei muscles, and sidewise towards the shoulder by the combined action of the sterno-cleido-mastoid and the splenii muscles. Strength of Muscles. It has been already noticed, that the muscles become by exertion larger and also stronger ; it is probable that they also become more dense, for in consequence of exercise, the pro- cess of absorption during exertion takes place more rapidly, and the fat between the fibres of the muscles is removed, while, at the same time, the circulation in the minute vessels becomes more active, in consequence of which there is a more copious supply and deposition of the muscular fibre. The strength of the voluntary muscles of young animals is not so great as those of animals that are older : thus, young horses of three years old are not capable of performing the labour of those of six or seven years, setting aside entirely the effect of work, and taking horses of these different ages, that have been similarly treated: hence weight for age is given at races. In order to form an estimate of the great strength of the muscles of the living body, it is necessary to examine with at- tention the manner in which these are inserted into the bones, and near to the joints; for their mechanism may be under- stood from the properties of the lever. Most of the muscles are so disposed as to act with a me- chanical disadvantage, being inserted into the bones near to the joints, and at an acute angle; they are levers of the third kind, situated between the fulcrum and the resistance. But this loss of strength is fully compensated by the velo- city with which they act, and the extent of motion they pro- duce; for it is more useful to us to move a moderate weight with due expedition, and with a considerable sweep, than to possess the power of raising a much greater weight more slow- ly, and through smaller space. It may be added, that the

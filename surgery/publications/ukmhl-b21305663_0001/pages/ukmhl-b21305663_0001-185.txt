139 OF THE OSSA TEMPORUM. There is a want of bone in the upper and fore part of the head of a child at the period of birth, owing to the imperfect ossification of the parietal and frontal bones. This unossified portion has been called bregma, or Jons pulsatilis, on account of the pulsation of the brain felt through this flexible liga- mento-cartilaginous substance. By an accurate examination it may be ascertained whether the foetus in utero be alive or not. The surgeon may apply his finger to the bregma when the os uteri is a little opened. If the bregma is stretched, and the pulsation of the brain is felt through it, the child is certainly alive : But if it is shri- velled and flaccid, without any observable pulsation in it, there is some reason to suspect the child to be very weak, or dead. The ossification of the bregma is generally perfect before five years of age. Ossa Temporum. The Ossa Temporum are equal and smooth above, with a very thin semicircular and ragged edge. Behind this, the upper part of the temporal bone is thicker, and more une- qual, and is sometimes described as a distinct part, under the name of pars mammillaris *, or mastoidea. Towards the base of the skull, the temporal bone ap- pears very irregular and unequal; and from it an oblong very hard substance, called Pars Petrosa, is extended horizontally forwards and inwards, which in its progress become smaller. The external processes of each temporal bone are, 1st, The mastoid, which is placed at the lower and hind part of the bone, the surface of which is scabrous, for the insertion of the stemo-mastoid, the trachelo-mastoid and splenius muscles. It is not solid, but within is composed of cancelli, or small cells, which have a communication with the cavity of the ear called Tympanum. About an inch farther forward, the se- cond process takes its rise; and having its origin continued obliquely downwards and forwards for some way, it becomes Albxn. dc Ossib. ยง 26.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 402 share of the crural arch, between the anterior spinous process of the os ilium and tubercle of the pubes, and may be called ilial portion; and the other, which arises from the pubes, pubal portion. Where the iliac part of the fascia lata ceases to be united to the crural arch, it forms a fold of the shape of a sickle, the concavity of which looks downwards and in- wards ; which was first accurately described by Mr Buuns of Glasgow, and called, by him, the falciform process of the fascia lata; and this covers that portion of the femoral artery and vein which is found immediately under the crural arch, and the under part of the iliacus internus and psoas muscles. The other, or pubal part, which is thinner than the ilial portion of the tendon, arises from the pubes, and covers part of the pectineus and triceps muscles, and is united with the ilial part, beneath the vena saphena major, where that vein joins the femoral vein. From the preceding description of the Muscles of the Ab- domen, it follows, 1st, That as the hollow bowels of the abdomen are in im- mediate contact with the peritoneum lining the abdominal muscles, there must be a constant action and reaction between the containing and contained parts; and hence, that any cause which increases the pressure of the contained bowels, or di- minishes the resistance of the containing parts, may give rise to hernia. â€˜Hdly, That as the contents of the abdomen are placed be- tween two compressive forces, the abdominal muscles and diaphragm, which act alternately or conjunctly upon these, any violent action of the former, or of the latter, or the inor- dinate combined action of both, may occasion a displacement of the bowels of the belly ; hence hernia is frequently oc- casioned by violent coughing, straining at stool, blowing wind instruments, &c. and especially by lifting heavy weights, as then the muscles exert themselves with a great force when the body is bent, and when the parietes of the abdomen are at the same time relaxed. 3dip, That if the peritoneum lining the abdominal muscles

OF THE SHAPE OF THE SKULL. 195 The former change is owing to the separation of the pa- rietal bones; the latter is the consequence of the separation of the upper part of the pieces composing the os frontis; (for the lower parts of the pieces of that bone,- on account of their connections with other bones, which are ossified at an early pe- riod of life, cannot recede from each other to any distance) ; and hence the face, instead of being nearly oviform, somewhat resembles a triangle, of which the brow makes the basis, and the chin the apex. As the disease advances, the forehead becomes unusually prominent, to such a degree, as often to prevent the unfortu- nate sufferer from seeing objects above the level of his eyes. During the continuance of the hydrocephalus chronicus, the distance from ear to ear, or the transverse diameter of the head, is increased, and the width of the head is most remark- able between the centres of ossification of the parietal bones. A disunion takes place between the upper portions of the pieces of bone which compose the os frontis, which is the cause of the very remarkable breadth of the upper part of the forehead ; and hence the forehead is somewhat of a conical form, the apex of the cone being at the root of the nose, and the base of it at the upper part of the forehead. From the continuance of the disease, owing to the water contained within the head elevating the bregma, and mem- brane between the parietal bones, the form of the head is still farther changed; its upper part becoming somewhat of a coni- cal figure. During the progress of the ossification, and from the inter- nal distention continuing to exert its influence over the grow- ing osseous fibres of the skull, which, on account of their length and weakness, do not oppose as much resistance to the internal distention as the centres of ossification ; the next change is the bulging out of the bones at the sides of the prominences, which is the consequence of a very large collec- tion of water within the head, and only occurs when the dis- ease has been of two or three years standing. The bones bulge out at the sides of the original centres of ossification of the pieces of the skull, which form the most re- 2

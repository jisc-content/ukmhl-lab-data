41 articulation of the rones. Symphisis, which properly signifies the concretion, or >n-owino- together, of parts, when used to express the articula- tion of bones, does not seem to comprehend, under the mean- ing o-enerally given to it, any thing relating to the form or motion of the conjoined bones, but by it most authors gene- rally denote the bones to be connected by some other sub- stance ; and as there are different substances which serve this purpose, therefore, they divide it into the three following species. 1st, Synchondrosis, When a cartilage is the connecting me- dium ; thus the ribs are joined to the sternum ; the bodies of the vertebrae to each other; as are likewise the ossa pubis. 2d, Syneurosis, or syndesmosis. When ligaments are the connecting bodies, as they are in all the moveable articula- tions. 3d, Syssarcosis, When muscles are stretched from one bone to another, without the intervention of cartilage or liga- ment. The second class of articulations, the synarthrosis, which is the general term by which the immoveable conjunction of bones is expressed, is divided into three kinds : 1st, The Suture * is that articulation where two bones are mutually indented into each other, and is formed by the fi- bres of two bones meeting, while they are yet flexible and yielding, and have not come to the full extent of growth. These indentations are very different, both in figure and magnitude : Thus the bones of the head are joined; thus epi- physes are joined to the bones, before their full connection and union with them. Under this title of suture, the liarmonia of the ancients may be comprehended; scarcely any immoveable bones being join- ed by plain surfaces -J\ 2d, Gomphosis %, is the fixing one bone into another, as a nail is fixed in a board : Thus the teeth are secured in their sockets. * 'P<*?â€¢/). $ Conclavatio. + Vebal.

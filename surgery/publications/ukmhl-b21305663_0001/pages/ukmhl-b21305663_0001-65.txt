OF TITE SKELETON. 10 The actions of pronation and supination in the hand range through 270°, but 90° of the rotatory motion are derived from the shoulder-joint. The palm of the hand admits of flexion and extension through 65° in each direction; its lateral motions are 35° out- ward and 30° inward. The flexion of the fingers is a right angle *. 7th, From the position of the skull and pelvis, from the width of the latter, the disproportion in the length of the su- perior and inferior extremities, and the very different struc- ture of the joints of these parts, it is evident that man is in- tended to be a biped. 8th, The bones of the human skeleton are so placed with respect to one another, that when put into their natural si- tuation, scarcely any one of them is placed in a perpendicular bearing to another; though the fabric composed of them is so contrived, that, in an erect posture, a perpendicular line, from their common centre of gravity, falls in the middle of their common base i*. On this account, we can support our- selves as firmly as if the axis of all the bones had been a straight line perpendicular to the horizon ; and we have much greater quickness, ease, and strength in several of the most necessary motions we perform. It is true, indeed, that where- ever the bones, on which any part of our body is sustained, decline from a straight line, the force required in the muscles, to counteract the gravity of that part, is greater than other- wise it needed to have been: But then this is effectually provided for in such places, by the number and strength of the muscles. So long, therefore as we remain in the same posture, a considerable number of muscles must be in a con- stant state of contraction; which we know, both from reason and experience, must soon create an uneasy sensation. This we call being weary of one posture; an inconvenience that * Above measurements by Sir Anthony Cakeysle. f Cowpeh, Anat. of Human Bodies, explic. of tab. 87. 88. H 2

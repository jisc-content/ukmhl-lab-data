The stylo-glossus muscle also comes into view arising from the styloid process of the under-jaw, and supported by its li- gament, and passing downwards to be fixed into the tongue; and a little below that muscle, another muscle, taking its rise also from the styloid process, and passing downwards to the pharynx, called hence Stylo-pharyngeus, comes into view Between the two preceding muscles and the Mylo-liyoideus muscle, there is the Hyo-glossus muscle, with its fibres pass- ing nearly perpendicularly downwards to be fixed into the tongue. A part of the constrictores pharyngis is also seen. Third Layer. Upon the preceding muscles being removed, the Genio- hyoideus, passing betwixt the symphysis of the under jaw and os hyoides, appears; and on the side of it, next the pharynx, (supposing the head to be viewed in profile), the Geniohyo- MUSCLES FOE MOVING THE OS HYOIDES. Maxillo-Hyoideus, or Mylo-hyoideus. This thin, flat, and broad muscle arises from a ridge on the inner side of the jaw, which extends between the chin and last grinding teeth. The fibres pass obliquely forwards and downwards, to the symphysis of the jaw, and are fixed into the body of the os hyoides. There is a portion of tendon in the middle of the muscles, of opposite sides, extending from the symphysis of the lower-jaw, to the base of the os hyoides. This muscle elevates the os hyoides ; and, when the os hy- oides is fixed, it may depress the under jaw. Genio-Hyoideus. This rounded muscle, which is placed under the former, passes from the symphysis of the under-jaw obliquely down- wards and backwards to the middle of the basis of the os hy- oides. By this muscle, the os hyoides is elevated, and drawn forwards towards the chin, when the jaws are shut.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 396 column as a distinct ligament. In the erect posture, this part of the tendon of the external oblique is placed almost horizon- tally, and is much deeper than the upper part of the tendon. The upper and under parts of the tendon of the external oblique muscle are widely different in another respect: The upper and outer is a thick rounded cord, extending from the spine of the os ilium to the tubercle and symphysis of the pubes: the under is reflected backwards and inwards, and is extended over the femoral bloodvessels ; and its posterior edge is very thin. The crural bloodvessels, lymphatics of the infe- rior extremities, the internal iliac and psoas muscles, and the protruded bowels, in cases of crural hernia, pass behind the crural arch. Ilio-Abdominalis Medius, or Obliquus Abdominis Interims. This muscle arises from the spine of the ilium, by a thin tendon common to the serratus posticus inferior, and the latis- simus dorsi; from the three lowest lumbar vertebrae, and from the inner side of the crural arch. From these origins the fi- bres describe a radiated course upwards; and, at the linea semilunaris, the tendon is fixed to the muscle, which divides into two layers ; one of which joins that of the external oblique, and forms the fore-part of the sheath of the rectus muscle; the other joins that of the transverse muscle, and goes behind the rectus, forming the posterior part of the sheath, till about half way between the navel and os pubis. This muscle is fixed into the linea alba, the cartilages of the false ribs, and the cartilago ensiformis. Lumbo-Abdominnlis, or Transversus Abdominis. This muscle arises from the inner side of Foupartâ€™s liga- ment ; from the back-part of the spine of the ilium ; from the inner surface of the six lower ribs; and from the transverse processes of the four uppermost vertebras of the loins. The fibres of this muscle run transversely across the abdo-

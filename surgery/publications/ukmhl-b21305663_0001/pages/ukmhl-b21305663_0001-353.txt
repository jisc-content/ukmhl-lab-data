or THE I-NTERVEUTEBKAL CARTILAGES. 307 man body is placed near to the posterior part of the bodies of the vertebrae; and therefore is nearly in the middle.between the anterior part of the bodies and the oblique processes of the vertebrae; so that, when we stand erect, each vertebra rests upon a fluid fulcrum or sort of pivot, the motion upon which to any side is easily and quickly performed ; and, at the same time, is not too hasty or unequal: for the compressibi- lity of the cartilages gradually increases from the liquid cen- tral incompressible part towards the circumference. Without this central pivot, in moving the spine from any reclined pos- ture to the opposite one, particularly in moving forwards a spine that was reclined far back, there would often be the greatest danger of a most violent shock of one vertebra upon another, and indeed of all the parts of the body supported by them; whereas this contrivance allows a very gradual change of the centre of motion of each vertebra, accommodated to the bearing of the superincumbent weight in the different deflec- tions of the spine from an erect posture, or in raising it to such a posture. This liquid fulcrum, too, will bear off the great pressure which the vessels of the ligamento-cartilaginous substance would suffer in our erect posture, that might be of ill conse- quence ; while the absorption of this liquor, increased by strong pressure, will serve to account, in part, for the difference of stature at night and in the morning The knowledge of the mechanism of the joints of the spine -f* points out a frequent cause of a lateral curvature of the back- bone, viz. the too great extension and diminution of the elas- ticity of the connecting intervertebral ligaments of weak per- sons. The disadvantage resulting from the central inelastic part of the joint being over-extended, by which the vertebrae are left unsupported; and also the benefit to be derived from a weight of several pounds being carried upon the head in walking; during which exercise, the muscles of the spine keep closely together its component bones, and the elastic interver- f Vide Edin.

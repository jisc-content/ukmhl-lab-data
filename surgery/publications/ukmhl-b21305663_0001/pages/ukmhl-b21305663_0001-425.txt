379 OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE. There is a muscle of the figure of an oblong square (which is in part covered by the under part of the preceding muscle), which ascends from the chin, and is fixed into the under lip, and has been named, from its office, Depressor Labii Infe- riors. The two last muscles are in part covered by a few thin muscular fibres of a thin muscle of the neck called the Pla- tysma Myoides. There are a few fibres passing transversely from one platys- ma myoides to the other, which have been described by San- torini under the name Transversus Menli. The muscular fibres which pass around the mouth, and which have been said to form the Orbicularis, or Sphincter Oris, are also obvious. Second Layer. Under the portion of the Occipito-Frontalis Muscle which is fixed into the superciliary ridge, a small rounded muscle is placed, which is fixed into the middle of the superciliary ridge, which has been called Corrugator Supercilii. The Temporal muscle is seen in the temples, and its ten- don passing under the zygoma. A strong muscle, extend- ing downward from the zygoma to the angle of the under jaw, called, from its very powerful effect in manducation, Masseter, is distinctly seen. The muscle called Buccinator, extending between the Mas- seter and Orbicularis Oris, is seen; the fat, and that part of the parotid gland which covered it, being removed. Under the Levator Labii superioris, there are a few scat- tered fibres, which Scemmering has noticed (vide his third volume, p. 102.) as a muscle, under the name of Muscidus anomalus Maxillae superioris. The Levator Anguli Oris is now seen arising from the su- perior maxillary bone, and fixed into the corner of the mouth. fh Third Layer. In this third layer, Albinus has represented the insertion of the muscle which draws the eye-ball towards the nose, and

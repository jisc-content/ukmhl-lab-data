But, when the thigh-bone is rolled or bent, a curious interchange takes place as to the action of the muscles; the rotator muscles become the abductors, and the abductors the rotator muscles. It may be also observed re- specting the muscles of the thigh, that when the leg is more fixed than the trunk of the body, the muscles of the thigh act upon the trunk of the body; they rotate the pelvis upon the top of the thigh-bone. SECTION XX. MUSCLES OF THE LEG. The leg is extended by four muscles, the rectus, vasti and cruraeus, which are inserted into the patella or rotula, by a common broad tendinous sheath. Ilio-Rotularis, or Rectus Anterior Cruris. This muscle arises, from the inferior and anterior spinous process of the os ilium, and from the capsular ligament of the joint, and extends along the whole anterior part of the thigh. The tendinous origins of this muscle are covered by the sar- torius and tensor vaginae femoris ; and- the fleshy belly at its uppermost part is covered by the sartorius muscle. This pen- niform muscle is fixed into the upper extremity of the patella. The three other extensors of the leg have been described by some authors under the name of Trifemorales; they lie under the rectus, seem to constitute one mass of flesh, and cannot be separated without cutting a few muscular fibres. Middle of the Trifemoro-Rotidaris, or Cruralis. This muscle, which is situated under the preceding, arises from the whole anterior surface of the thigh-bone, and is fix- ed into the posterior surface of the tendon of the rectus mus- cle, and lies between the two following muscles, which in part cover it.

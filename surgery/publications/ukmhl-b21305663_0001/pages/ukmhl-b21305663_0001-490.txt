ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 444 SECTION XV. BURS/E MUCOSAE OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. Bursa in the Vicinity of the Shoulder-Joint. There are several bursae around this joint. There is a bursa which may be named coraco-brachialis, as it is situated between the origin of the coraco-brachialis muscle, the scapulo-radialis muscle, and the capsular ligament of the joint. There is a bursa, under the head of the os humeri, between it and the tendon of the teres major muscle and that bone. There is a bursa between the tendon of the latissimus dorsi and the os humeri. There is a large bursa between the acromion scapula?, the coracoid process, and capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint, and also a small bursa between the coracoid process and cap- sular ligament of the humerus; this, however, is sometimes wanting. There is a bursa above the tendon of the infra-spin at us, and teres major muscle. There is a bursa between the clavicle and coracoid process of the scapula. There is a bursa between the subclavian muscle and first rib. There is a bursa between the clavicle and coracoid process, where the former bone works on the coracoid process. There is a vaginal shaped bursa, which incloses the tendon of the long head of the scapulo-radialis muscle: and there is a very small bursa placed under that part of the muscle which passes over the head of the os humeri: and a bursa is also placed under the tendon of the subscapularis muscle, which communicates with the cavity of the joint. Bursa Mucosa situated near the Elbow-Joint. There is a bursa between the tendons of the biceps bra- cheus internus, and anterior tubercle of the radius. The tu-

ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. 252 Between the back part of that internal smooth side and this process, there is a grove for the tendon of the extensor carpi idnaris. On the fore-part of the root of the process, such ano- ther depression may be remarked, for the passage of the ul- nar artery and nerve. The end of the bone is smooth, and covered with a carti- lage. Between it and the bones of the wrist, a doubly concave movable cartilage is interposed; which is a continuation of the cartilage that covers the lower end of the radius, and is connected loosely to ihe root of the styloid process. The ulna is articulated above with the lower end of the os humeri. There are corresponding depressions and prominences in these bones; thus, the fore-arm may be extended to near- ly a straight line, and bent to a very acute angle; but, by the slanting position of the pully, the lower part of the fore arm is turned outwards in the extension, and inwards in the flexion * ; and a very slight degree of rotation is likewise al- lowed in all positions, especially when the ligaments are most relaxed, by the fore-arm being in a middle degree of flexion. The ulna is also articulated with the radius and carpus- Of the Radius. The Radius, so called from its imagined resemblance to a spoke of a wheel, is placed at the inside of the fore-arm. The humeral extremity of the bone is circular, and exca- vated for its articulation with the tubercle at the side of the pully of the os humeri: the half of the round circumfe- rence of the head next to the ulna is smooth, and covered with a cartilage, and is received into the semi-lunated cavity of that bone. Below the head, the radius is much smaller; therefore this part is named its cervix. At the external root of this neck, a tuberous process rises; into the outer part of which the tendon of the biceps flexor ■ Winslow, Memoires dc l’Acad. dcs Sciences, 1722. •

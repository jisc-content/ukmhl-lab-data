3l9 OF THE FAT. other animals, that it is every -where contained in spherical bags, painted with vessels resembling in size, as well as in structure, those of the marrow; none of which, in diameter, exceed the six-hundredth part of an inch, nor are less than one-eight hundredth part of it. Holes in the sides of these bags, or ducts leading from them, and connecting them to each other, are not distinguishable, even with a microscope of high powers. In the hope of discovering more fully the texture of the adipose follicles, I have repeatedly examined with the microscope the texture of large steatoms; in which I was a good deal surprised to find the follicles not only as regularly shaped, but nearly as minute, as those of the fat in a sound state : Nay, I have often, in the same person, com- pared the fat of the sound cellular texture with that of a stea- tom, without being able to perceive any difference. I have, besides, tried the experiment of holding a thin portion of fat between my finger and thumb, dipped into water heated to above a hundred degrees of Fahrenheitâ€™s scale, and pressing it gently, without finding that the adipose follicles can by moderate pressure be emptied or made flat; and globules of oil are not distinguishable, even with the microscope, in the liquors taken from the abdomen, joints, and bursae. Hence some may perhaps infer, that there are no holes or ducts leading from them of considerable size. At the same time, from the oiliness which the surface of the skin, especial- ly in the Negro, gets after exercise; from finding that the crusts, procured by evaporating these liquors to dryness, are inflammable ; from the greasy feel of the omentum, or of the appendices epiploicae of the colon even in a living animal; from the shortness of the omentum in man, compared with the great length of it in the quadruped, which we cannot ac- count for in any other way than that the body of the one animal was intended to be erect, and that of the other hori- zontal ; and, in the last place, as we scarcely can suppose that these fatty bodies in the joints and bursae, and the omen- ta, serve merely as cushions for the defence of the secerning vessels, and therefore cannot point out any other material use for the omentum arid these fatty bodies but that of furnishing

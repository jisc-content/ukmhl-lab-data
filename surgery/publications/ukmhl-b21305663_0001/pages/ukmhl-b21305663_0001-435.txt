OF THE MUSCLES OF THE OS HYOIDES. 389 risk of attempting to tie the artery nearer to the heart than the scaleni muscles.‚Äù Covering a part of the trachea, may be seen the thin mus- cle arising from the breast-bone, and fixed into the os hyoides, called Stemo-Hyoideus; and, higher up the neck, a part of a muscle which has passed under the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, which, from its origin from the scapula, and insertion into the os hyoides, has been called Omo-hyoideus. Third Layer. By removing the above mentioned muscles, the thyroid and cricoid cartilages of the larynx are seen; and, covering the fore-part of the trachea, a muscle, which arises from the breast-bone, and is fixed into the thyroid cartilage of the larynx, and which has therefore been called Sterno-Thyroi- deus; and also a muscle which arises from the thyroid carti- lage, and is fixed into the os hyoides, and which has hence been named Thyro-Hyoideus. Disposition of the Muscles of the Os Hyoides and Tongue. To get a distinct view of the muscles of the os hyoides and tongue, the head should be thrown back, in order to put these muscles upon the stretch. First Layer. Upon the skin, cellular membrane, and tendinous aponeu- rosis below the chin being removed, the following muscles come into view. The anterior head of the digastric muscle, extending be- . tween the symphysis of the lower jaw and os hyoides, and the posterior head of the same muscle passing through the stylo- hyoid muscle, downwards and forwards, to be fixed to the os hyoides ; and between the two heads of the muscle, the sub- maxillary gland is placed. Second Layer. Lpon detaching the above named muscles, the thin and broad muscle, called Mylo-hyoideus, comes into view, extend-

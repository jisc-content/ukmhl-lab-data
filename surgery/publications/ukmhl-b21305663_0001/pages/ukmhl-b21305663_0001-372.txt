ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 326 thereafter we were obliged to withdraw it, on account of a violent inflammation ; which, however, had the effect of cre- ating the union of the opposite sides of the bursa, and there- by accomplishing a cure. In the course of the present year, 1796, I was consulted by two patients with a considerable collection of synovia with- in the bursa which is behind the insertion of the extensors of the leg into the patella. In both, after the application of discussing liquors and of blisters had been tried in vain, the liquor was drawn off by a lancet-shaped trocar passed obliquely, with the view of ex- cluding the air. It may be worth while to remark, that the liquor brought to a boiling heat was found to contain much more coagulable matter than the synovia does in a sound state. In one case, the operation was palliative only, and was not followed with inflammation or pain ; but, in the other case, the whole knee inflamed violently, and suppurated, probably from the rest- lessness of the patient and admission of the air; so that the amputation of the limb became unavoidable. It is therefore evident, that the bursae and capsular liga- ments of the joints resemble each other in their sensibility, as well as in their structure otherwise, and in their diseases *.

The condyle of the under-jaw is retained in its place by a capsular ligament, which is connected with the temporal bone. * All the observations contained in this section, excepting Dr Davy’s analy- sis of the synovia of the ox, and the paragraph immediately following, ending with the word injured, have been derived from the 7th section of my Father’s book on the Bursae Mucosae, published in Edinburgh, 1788.

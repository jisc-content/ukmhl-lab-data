7 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. lowino- eleven simple tissues,â€”the Cellular, the Bony, the Cartilaginous, Sero-fibrous, Mucous, Muscular, Adipose,-and the Tissue of the Skin, the Cuticle, with that of the Hair, and Nerves. The general systems are the Circulating, Absorbing, and Nervous. It is not easy to detect the chemical ingredients Avhich en- ter into the composition of the body, as new compounds are formed during the processes instituted for that purpose, and as many of the constituent principles are apt to escape in a ga- seous form, or to elude observation. Animal substances are prone to putrefaction ; oxygen is ab- sorbed, and carbonic acid and ammonia are formed during the putrefaction. SirH. Davy has justly observed, that according to the diffe- rent proportions of the above named principles in the animal economy, so are the changes they undergo different. When there is much saline or earthy matter mixed with them, the progress of then* decomposition is less rapid than when their principles are composed chiefly of gelatine, albumen, or urea. According to our present knowledge of animal chemistry, carbon, azote, oxygen and hydrogen constitute the elemen- tary principles of the animal body; but their binary or terna- ry compositions have not yet been fully investigated. By the influence of the Vital Principle, the above elemen- tary principles are brought into union. Azote is largely contained in animal substances, not only in the solids, but also in the fluids; and it is found in its un- combined state in the air-bag of some fishes. Hydrogen forms a considerable ingredient of the animal kingdom. It exists in the solids and fluids; it is generally combined with charcoal, and has been found in the intestines and stomach, in the form of carburetted hydrogen. Oxygen forms also a share of the solids and fluids of ani- mals. It occurs in a separate state in the air-bag of some fishes, and is often combined with carbon, forming carbonic

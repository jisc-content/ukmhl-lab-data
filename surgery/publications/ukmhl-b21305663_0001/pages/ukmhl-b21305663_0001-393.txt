ON THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. 347 CHAP. I. ON THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. SECTION I. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS. The flesh or muscles constitute a large portion of the bulk of the bodies of animals. The muscles are subservient to various and very important offices in the animal economy. They are the instruments of locomotion, speech, chewing, sucking, swallowing, singing, kc., and by the same means the blood, the contents of the alimentary canal, and of the different excretory ducts of the glands, are propelled. The muscles are composed of soft, moist, flexible, semipel- lucid fibres, possessing a small share of elasticity. The fibres of the muscles of the class Mammalia have a red colour, but in the inferior animals they are white ; and be- tween the fibres a quantity of cellular substance, albumen, jelly and fat, is interposed. The size of the muscular fibre is not proportioned to the bulk of the animal ; it varies also in the different muscles of the same animal. There is a considerable difference as to the density of the muscular fibres. The density varies very much in the different sexes, and in different muscles of the same animal, being greatest in those muscles which are most ex- erted. In very early life, and in old age, the muscles are much softer than in the meridian of life. The density bears

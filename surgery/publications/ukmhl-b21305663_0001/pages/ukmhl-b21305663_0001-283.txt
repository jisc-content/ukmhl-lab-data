237 OF THE EXTHEMKTIKS. monkey tribe are provided with another organ of apprehension, a prehensile tail. The broader part of the human foot is placed at right angles to the bones of the leg; it projects con- siderably backwards, forming a broad basis of support, and presents a large surface of connection for the extensor mus- cles. The form, size, and position of the heel-bone, distin- guish man from the inferior animals. The foot gradually increases in breadth towards the toes, which adds to the width of the basis. The bones of the great toe have comparatively little motion, are parallel to the bones of the other toes, and constitute a firm support to the weight of the body : its movements are much more limited than those of the thumb, because the great toe is one of the props on which the body is supported. In short, there are combined in the human foot greater sta- bility and surface than in any other animal. The human foot applies accurately to the inequalities of the surface of the ground ; the whole surface of the tarsus, metatarsus and toes touches the ground : whereas the feet of monkeys rest on their outer margin, in order that they may employ the thumb and long hinder toes, as organs of appre~ hension, for the taking hold of the branchesof trees, in climbing. The feet of quadrupeds that have hoofs are contracted and elongated, and they touch the ground merely with the point of the foot; and these bones, which correspond with our os cal- cis, are placed in a perpendicular direction to the other bones of the foot. Lastly, the human foot is concave, lest in our erect position the muscles, tendons, bloodvessels, nerves, and absorbent ves- sels, should be pinched bv the erect position. SECTION I.

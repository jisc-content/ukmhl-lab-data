303 OF CARTILAGE. the water, was considerably less than in the first instance; and the effect of the acetate of lead was still more diminished. The cold sulphuric and muriatic acids acted on it very slowly ; the former, after twenty-four hours, had acquired, from a small portion of cartilage that it had dissolved, a reddish-brown co- lour ; and the latter, though most of the cartilage had disap- peared, yet remained colourless. The nitric acid acted readily on it, and formed a yellow solution. JBoth the concentrated sulphuric and muriatic acid quickly dissolved it, when assisted by a gentle heat. The sulphuric solution was of a dark red- dish-brown, and the muriatic was of a light reddish purple. A strong solution of potash also easily dissolved it. 100 grains of it were slowly, but completely dried. In this state it had the appearance of horn, being brittle and semitransparent. The loss it sustained was equal to 55 grains. The dried car- tilage was heated to redness in a platina crucible: it swelled up very much, seemed to fuse, inflamed, and left a bulky charcoal. This charcoal incinerated, afforded about grain of earthy matter, which, as it dissolved in nitric acid, and was again precipitated by ammonia, appeared to be phosphate of lime. Hence it may be concluded that 100 parts of human cartilage consist of about 44.5 Albumen. 55.0 Water. .5 Phosphate of Lime. 100.0 “ The effects of the acetate of lead and the infusion of nut- galls, as they were greatly diminished on the water in which the cartilage was a second time boiled, may be fairly attributed to a little adhering extraneous animal matter, or to the peri- chondrium itself, and not to the cartilage.” The cartilages have been divided by anatomists into two great classes, viz. into those which are permanent, and those which are temporary only. -Hie permanent cartilages are, the Articular, Interarticular, and Intervertebral, those of the External Ear, of the Nose, Eyelids, Larynx, and Windpipe.

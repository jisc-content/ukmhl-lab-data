ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 8 acid, which is contained in blood ; and also in urine, and in the intestines of animals; and is emitted by expiration. These different elements form Gelatine, Fibrine, Albumen, Extractive, Mucus, Sugar, Urea, Oils, Spermaceti, Amber- gris. Of Gelatine.—It is got from the skin, bones, muscles, liga- ments and blood, by being boiled in water; it enters largely into the structure of the softest parts of the animal frame; and, when boiled to a proper consistence, forms size and glue. Of Albumen.—It is got in the purest state, in the form of the white of an egg. Coagulated albumen forms a large share' of bones and shells; and of the greater number of the animal fluids. OfFibrine.—It is got from blood; the part of that fluid which has coagulated consists chiefly of it; it is white, soft and elastic, before being dried. This substance constitutes a large share of the muscles. Of Extractive.—It is got by boiling the flesh for some time in water, to which it gives a peculiar flavour; the gelatine and albumen remain; and if the solution be evaporated to dryness, and treated with alkohol, a solution of extractive is obtained. Of Mucus.—It serves to protect the parts from the acrimony of their contents. This term is applied to different secreted fluids; and hence the uncertainty which prevails as to its distinctive characters. The mucus of the nose has been particularly examined by Beuzelius *. Of Sugar.—It exists in milk, and in the urine of diabetic persons; it may be obtained from the former, by evaporating the whey. Of Oils.—The animal oils differ as to colour, consistence, smell, and other characters. The greater number of these possess the properties of fix- Vide Annals of Philosophy, vol. ii. p, 380.

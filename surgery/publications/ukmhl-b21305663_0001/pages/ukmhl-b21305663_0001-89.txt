articulation of the bones. 43 articulations of the body, and one of its species does not an- swer to any notion we can have of the conjunction of two bones, I must beg leave to change the definitions and kinds of these joints. The diarthrosis is that conjunction of bones, whereby they are fitted for motion, being each covered with a smooth carti- lage, connected by one or more common ligaments, and lubri- cated with liquor at the conjoined parts. In which definition, I pay no regard to the quantity of motion which they really do perform ; the motion being often confined or enlarged by some other cause not immediately depending on the frame of the two surfaces of the bones forming the particular joint in question. The first species of the diarthrosis, viz- the enarthrosis or ball and socket, may be defined more generally than above :â€” That articulation where a round head of one bone i9 received into a cavity of another, and consequently, Avithout some fo- reign impediment, is capable of motion to all sides. The ar- ticulation of the thigh-bone and ossa innominata ; Arm-bone and scapula; astragalus and os naviculare ; magnum of the wrist, with the scaphoides and lunare ; the metacarpal and me- tatarsal bones with the first bones of the fingers and toes, &c. are examples of this kind of joint. The second sort* or the arthrodia, differing from the enar- throsis, described above, only in the cavity being more super- ficial, Avhich makes no essential difference, especially as, in the recent subject, cartilages or ligaments supply the deficiency of bone, ought, in my opinion, to be called, with Vesalius, that articulation of two bones adapted for motion, where it is not at first sight obvious which of the two has the head or cavity, or where they are joined by plain surfaces, or nearly so ; such as the conjunction of the clavicle with the scapula ; ossa cu- neiformia with the os naviculare ; metatarsal bones Avith the ossa cuneiformia, &c. From the nature of this sort of joint, it is plain, that very great motion cannot be allowed, Avithout the bone3 going farther out of their natural situation, than is convenient or safe.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 234 All of the skulls were of a reddish brown colour, and in a moist state : several of them cracked when dried. Dr Davy was so polite as to examine chemically, the cunei- form process of the occipital bone of one of the skulls, and found that it contained some animal matter, with a less pro- portion than recent hone, and the animal matter appeared to be entirely cartilage or condensed albumen, without any oil. It may be deserving of notice also, that the earthy part of this bone had apparently undergone a slight change, for it con- tained scarcely any trace of carbonate of lime. I shall conclude this very imperfect sketch in the language of Mr Keate: “ The inquisitive mind of man,11 says that distinguished author, “ too eager after knowledge which his limited faculties can never reach, often idly asks, Where- fore all these varied gradations in human existence ? But his question will for ever remain unanswered ; and he must content himself with being satisfied, that the ways of Providence are conducted with unerring wisdom, to answer purposes beyond mortal comprehension.

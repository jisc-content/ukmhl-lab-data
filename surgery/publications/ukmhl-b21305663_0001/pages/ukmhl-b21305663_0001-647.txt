OF THE PANCREAS. 599 The absorbing vessels of the spleen are large and numer- ous. There is no excretory duct proper to the spleen; and hence we are much in the dark as to the use of this organ *. SECTION V. OF THE PANCREAS. The Pancreas resembles the salivary glands in its colour, consistence, structure, functions, and in the organic derange- ments to which it is liable. This conglomerate gland, which has been compared to the tongue of a dog, is placed across the spine behind the stomach, in the epigastric region. It ex- tends into the left hypochondriac region, and it is placed be- fore the aorta, vena cava, part of the splenic vessels, and in front of a part of the edge of the transverse part of the duo- denum. This gland has no proper capsule excepting at its fore part, and where it is covered by the root of the mesocolon ; and the other parts of this gland are connected to the neighbouring parts by loose cellular substance, which behind connects it to the vertebrae. The pancreas is about seven inches in length, and two in breadth, and its right or larger extremity is connected by short cellular substances to the left side of the second turn of the duodenum, from which part of it there is a process called the lesser pancreas, which also is fixed to the duodenum : and the left or smaller extremity is fixed to the spleen by the omen- tum majus. There is some little variety as to the shape of this gland. The anterior and posterior surfaces of this gland are nearly flat. There is a sort of groove in this gland, in which the splenic artery is placed. • See the opinion of Mr Hewbon on the Use of the Spleen, in his Essay on the Blood.—Vide also the Observations of my Father on the Use of the Spleen, in his book on the Anatomy of Fishes-

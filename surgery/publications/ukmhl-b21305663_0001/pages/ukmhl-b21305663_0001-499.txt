MUSCLES OF THE LEG. 353 Outer Share of the Trfemoro-Rotularis, or Vastus Externus. This muscle, which occupies the outer side of the thigh- bone, arises from the anterior surface of the root of the tro- chanter major, and from the outer edge of the linea aspera, and is inserted into the external surface of the tendon of the rectus cruris. Inner Share of'the Trifemoro-Rotularis, or Vastus Internus. This muscle fills up the inner part of the thigh-bone, and arises from the root of the trochanter minor, from the upper edge of the linea aspera, and from the whole internal surface of the thigh-bone, and it is inserted into the lateral surface of the tendon of the rectus cruris. My Father remarks *, that the direction, length, and num- ber of the fibres, in such muscles, had not been sufficiently attended to by anatomists and surgeons; and that, in many instances, the breadth of these muscles had been mistaken for their length; that, in consequence of this inattention, they would find Mr Louis -f* attempting to discard the double in- cision of the soft parts in the amputation of the thigh, though, from the obliquity and shortness of the muscular fibres which cover the thigh-bone, this improvement of Cheselden is more essential than in the amputation of the humerus, where the fleshy fibres, though oblique, are proportionally longer, and of course their retraction greater. The middle and greater part of the tendon, common to the four extensor muscles of the leg, lias sometimes been lacerated ; in which case, the torn portions should be kept in contact, by extending the patient’s limb, and by bandaging. My Father used to make mention of the case of a patient, who, though 74 years of age, could, at the end of three weeks, walk up and down stairs, without being obliged to bring both feet • See Observations on the Oblique Muscles, Phil.

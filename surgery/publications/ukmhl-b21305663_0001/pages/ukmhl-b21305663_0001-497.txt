MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. 451 ca, which is fixed into the posterior part of the crural arch ; and a part of the fascia is continued behind the femoral ves- sels, and forms the posterior part of the crural sheath. The iliacus interims and psoas muscles not only bend the thigh, but also, from passing around the bone, when the toes are turned inwards, their first effect is to give a degree of rota- tion to the thigh. These muscles are chiefly counteracted by the glutaeus maximus. Pubo-Femoralis, or Pectinalis. This muscle, which arises from the superior margin of the os pubis, and forms a part of the brim of the pelvis, is fixed, by a thin tendon, into the trochanter minor, and linea aspera below it. The following muscle draws the thighs inwards, as in riding on horseback, and towards each other. Sub-Pubo, Sub-Pubi, Ischu-Femorales ; or Triceps Adductor Femoris. The first portion arises from the symphysis pubis, between the pectinalis and gracilis muscles; the second from the de- scending branch of the os pubis, behind the other two heads, forming a broad flat muscular septum between the muscles on the fore and back of the thigh; and the third from the tube- rosity of the ischium, and lying under the origin of the long- est head and pectinalis muscles. These muscles are fixed into the whole length of the linea aspera. The three last muscles are counteracted by the Sub-Pubo- Trochcmterus Extermis, or Obturator Extcrnus. This muscle, which covers the foramen obturatorium, is covered in front by the pectinalis and triceps, and behind by the quadratus femoris: arises from the edge of the obtura- tor hole, and is fixed into the trochanter major. The thigh- bone may be not only bent and extended, but also rotated. If the thigh be in the same line with the body, and we wish to bend it, we throw into action the quadratus femoris, the pyriformis, gemini, and obturator muscles, and also the iliacus f f 2

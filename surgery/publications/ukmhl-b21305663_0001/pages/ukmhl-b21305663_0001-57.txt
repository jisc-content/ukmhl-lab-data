11 ON THE SKELETON. out the interposition of a more unyielding substance: but those of the larger animals that move with greater velocity, that bound or leap to a considerable distance, are fixed to a hard and unyielding basis, formed of scale or bone, which serve as levers or fulcra for the muscles, and for the defence of the softer and more delicate parts of the body. The muscles are fixed to the spine, to the scales, 01 to the bone, by the medium of strong, dense small cords, called Tendons, to which certain shut bags, or friction-wheels, or Bursa Mucosa, are appended, to prevent the bad effects of friction. For the purpose of locomotion, there must be a number of bones, to admit of the varied and necessary movements; and the smooth surfaces of the bones forming the joints, which are applied to each other, are covered by cartilage, which is very smooth and elastic; and to avert still farther the inju- rious effects of friction, these cartilages are constantly be- smeared by a viscid fluid called Synovia. The bones are fixed to each other by strong membranes called Ligaments. The whole assemblage of bones has been called the Ske- leton, which sustains, gives attachment, shape, proportions, and defence, to the softer organs,â€”is in short the frame-work of the body. The skeleton of some animals is external, as in the Testa- cea and Crustacea; and in many animals that have white blood it is an external crust or shell; but the human skeleton is in- ternal, being covered by the softer parts; and though thus covered, the bones are seen obscurely through many of the superincumbent parts, so as to form the outline of the body. The skeletons of animals that walk, fly, creep, or swim, bear a distant resemblance to each other: each is composed of a number of bones; and there is, for instance, a similarity between the bones of the human hand and those of the wings of bats, and those of the fins of fishes, and between the bones of the trunk of their bodies.

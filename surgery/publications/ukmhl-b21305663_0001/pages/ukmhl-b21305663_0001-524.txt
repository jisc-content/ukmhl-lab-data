ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 478 SECT. I. OF THE TEETH. All the mammalia have teeth excepting some species of whales, Scaly Lizards, and the American Ant-eaters. The teeth of different animals vary much in form, size and number. Some animals, as the ox and sheep, have teeth only in the un- der jaw. Others, as the Mammoth and Elephant, have only two grinding teeth in each jaw ; these are in constant use, but they are provided with a succession of teeth ; and in some ani- mals, as the lobster, the teeth are placed within the stomach. The teeth of fishes are very numerous; they are fixed in the jaws, palate, back-part of the partition of the nose, and beginning of the gullet. The human teeth are not only useful as instruments of man- ducation, but also assist us in pronouncing certain letters of the alphabet. There are some national peculiarities as to the teeth. The greater size and oblique position of the teeth of the Negro have been already noticed. Blumenbach has stated, that the incisor teeth of some Egyptian mummies resembled trun- cated cones; and also, that the canine teeth were broad and flat on the masticating surfaces ; a circumstance also noticed by Middleton, in a mummy preserved in the University of Cambridge. This alteration in the form of the teeth may probably be imputed to the teeth having been worn down. I have two Esquimaux skulls, in which the teeth have been worn down to a great degree, and are of the same form which Blumenbach has desciâ€™ibed. Before proceeding to describe in detail the nature of the human teeth, it is necessary to premise a brief description of the gum. The gum is a red coloured substance, which adheres firmly to the alveolar processes, and to the necks of the teeth. Be- fore the teeth are cut, the gum, which has somewhat of a car- tilaginous hardness, and which forms a ridge over the whole length of the jaws, is a sort of substitute for the teeth. The

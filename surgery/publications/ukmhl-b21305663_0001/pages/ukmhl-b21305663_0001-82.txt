In consequence of the bones being hollow, they are much lighter than if they had been solid ; much larger and stronger muscles would have been required to move the bones, and this would have been attended with another disadvantage, the animal must have been larger, and must have been supplied with more blood. Of the Marrow. The marrow, which differs in appearance in different bones, is secreted by the small arteries which are distributed upon the follicles which contain it. These arteries are very small, and not obvious to our unassisted senses. Pure marrow, according to Berzelius, is a species of fixed oil, possessing peculiar properties, and somewhat like butter. It consists of the following ingredients : Pure marrow, - 0.96 Skins and bloodvessels. - 0.01 Albumen, | Gelatine, ( 0.02 Extractive, ( Peculiar matter, J Water, 1.03 There is at least one considerable artery proper to each bone ; several bones have more. These arteries, after piercing the solid side of a bone, are divided into several branches; which arc distributed on the internal periosteum, and on the medullary cells, and then pass outwards through the tables of the bone. The blood, which remains after the secretion of the mar- row, is returned by large veins formed by the junction of the smaller veins, and which pass out at the same holes in the bones as the arteries enter. The membrane of the marrow is probably sensible, though-

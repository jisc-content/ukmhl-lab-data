XXXI PREFACE. plied me with several skulls of the inhabitants of dif- ferent remote countries, and particularly with those of the natives of the Islands of the Pacific Ocean, and of Van Dieman’s Land. As so much has been lately written respecting the arch of the fore-head, and the frontal sinuses, I felt it to be a duty to devote my particular attention to this part of osteology ; and, to prevent all undue bias, examined with care the numerous specimens which are in the Museum of the University, as illustrative of this part of anatomy. It may not be improper to add, that I only met with three out of forty-three specimens in adult skulls, in which there was no ves- tige of an intervening space between the plates of the frontal bone. In Part II., which treats of the cartilages, synovial apparatus, and ligaments, my Grandfather’s account is given of the mechanism of the intervertebral carti- lages which he discovered; and the structure of the cap- sular ligaments of the different joints is compared. The observations upon this subject are chiefly derived from my Father, who was the first (as far as I know) who pointed out the identity between the structure of these, and other serous membranes ; and who also proved, that serous membranes are liable to peculiar organic derangements. Part III. which relates to the muscles, tendons, and bursae mucosae, has undergone a careful revisal. The descriptions of the muscles, and of their mode of action, have been extended; and it lias been my aim to render my Father’s observations on the ob- lique muscles more intelligible to those who are not deeply conversant with mathematics.

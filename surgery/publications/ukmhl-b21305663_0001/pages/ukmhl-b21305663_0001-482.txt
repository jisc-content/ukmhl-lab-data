ELEMENTS Ol' ANATOMY. 436 cess of the ulna; and, becoming gradually smaller, it passes under the supinator radii longus, extends across the upper end of the flexor muscles of the wrist, and is fixed into the interior and upper part of the radius, below the supinator ra- dii brevis. Ulno-Radialis, or Pronator Radii Quadratics. This muscle, which lies close upon the interosseous liga- ment, extends between the carpal extremities of the ulna and radius. The muscles of the fore-arm may occasionally act on the trunk of the body, when the fore-arm has been fixed. Thus, when the triceps extensor cubiti is thrown into action, the trunk of the body may be moved. The brachialis internus is the antagonist of the triceps, but more limited in its action, on account of its greater shortness. If the arm be fixed, the biceps and triceps may act on the scapula, and the scapula may be made to move on the head of the humerus. Thus we have been informed of a person, who placed a cane between his scapula, and grasped it, so that he could raise his body from the ground upon it; to do which, he put together the palm of his hands behind his back, in or- der fully to stretch the bicepates, and by acting with these muscles, he raised the scapula on the heads of the ossa hu- meri. SECTION XIII. MUSCLES OF THE HAND. Muscles of the Carpus and Metacarpus. The muscles of the carpus have been named radial or ul- nar, according to the side of the fore-arm along which they pass; and internal or external, according to the condyle of the humerus from which they take their origin. Two of the muscles of the carpus are fexors, and three extensors of the hand.

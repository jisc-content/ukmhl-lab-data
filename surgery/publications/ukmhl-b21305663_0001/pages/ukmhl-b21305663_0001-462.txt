ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 416 one, a fasciculus of fascia, which, by winding round the top of the thigh, must, in those motions which would endanger the parts, be made closely to embrace the cord, adapting thus, in a most accurate manner, the size of the lower outlet to the size of the cord. “We thus see, that, by the posterior wall of the canal, in- guinal hernia is, in the adult, prevented from talcing place through the upper orifice; and that, by the peculiarity of the mechanism of the lower opening, ventro-inguinal hernia can- not occur, except where, by violence, the posterior side of the canal is burst, or the cross slips torn, by which the fillet, from the upper pillar, would come to lose its effect. “ When hernia has taken place, the very objects which for- merly had a tendency to prevent its accession, are now so far changed in their action, that they present obstacles to the re- placement of the gut. If the hernia has occurred in a young subject, where the canal is not formed, or in an adult, in whom the posterior side is wanting, which is not a very rare malformation, then our only difficulty must depend on the action of the lower outlet. In this case, the cross fibres which bind the two pillars together, act on the sac; and the fillet, from the upper pillar, embraces it closely, but not equally, in every direction of the limb. When the toes are rolled inward, and the thigh, on the affected side, pulled from the other, and turned backward, this fillet is sunk into the sac, and retains it immoveably in its situation. “ This species of stricture may most readily be overcome, by moving the member in an opposite wray ; and, I believe, in knowing how to humour the parts in the taxis, the great superiority of one surgeon over another consists. When, however, the rupture has taken place in infancy, and conti- nued till the complete extension of the canal is accomplished, then, besides this source of difficulty, there is also a source of embarrassment, arising from the reaction of the fibres of the transversalis and internal oblique muscles upon the sac, which occasions a species of stricture, in which bloodletting, warmth, and the relaxing the muscles by bending the body sideways, facilitate the reduction. The above remark applies to that

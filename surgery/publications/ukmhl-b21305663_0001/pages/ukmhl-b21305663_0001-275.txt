OF THE NEW ZEALANDElt’s SKULL. 229 Journal in New Zealand, p. 282. violent conduct of their husbands, who, considering women as beings infinitely inferior to t hemselves, oftn treat them with great brutality *. The New Zealander differs very essentially in appearance from the New Hollander, or native of Van Dieman’s Land. My description is drawn from five specimens. The skull is thick, hard and heavy. The cranial part of the skull bears a large proportion to the bones of the face ; the frontal bone is not much depressed, and is rather broader from side to side than that of the Negro, but not so much so as in the Euro- pean. The temporal muscles take their rise high upon the sides of the head. The occipital bone is by no means so convex as in the European. The breadth of the head before the ear is greater than that behind it. The ear is rather small, and placed high up in the head. The bones of the face are prominent, the cheeks broad, the face across the cheek bones measuring 5§ inches. The spine at the roots of the zygomatic processes of the temporal bones are unusually prominent. The teeth are not larger than in the European skull. In one of the specimens they were smaller, excepting the canine teeth of the under jaw; and in another they were excessive- ly worn down, though there was not a grey hair in the head. The mouth is not so large, nor are the lips so thick, as those of the Negro, or native of New South Wales. The chin does not retreat as that of the Negro. The hair is long, straight, and of a jet black colour. The natives of the Pelew Islands may be comprehended in this great class. To the classical pen of Mr Keate, we are deeply indebted for a most interesting account of the na- tives of the Pelew Islands, a people widely different from those last described, and possessing in a striking degree all the more amiable dispositions of the heart.

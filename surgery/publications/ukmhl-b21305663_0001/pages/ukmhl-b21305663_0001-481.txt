435 SUPINATOR AND PRONATOR MUSCLES. SECTION XII. OF THE SUPINATOR AND PRONATOR MUSCLES. There are two bones in the fore-arm, the ulna and radius. The former is moved in the flexion and extension of the fore- arm ; the latter in the supination and pronation of the hand. There are two muscles by which supination is performed, and two pronator muscles also. Supinator Muscles. Humero-Super-Radialis, or Supinator Radii Longus. This muscle lies immediately under the skin ; it arises from a ridge of the os humeri above the external condyle of that bone; it is placed between the bracheus internus and short head of the triceps extensor cubiti, and is inserted, by means of a long tendon, into the carpal end of the radius, which it moves from within outwards upon the ulna. The extensor muscles of the thumb cross over the place of the insertion of this muscle Epicondylo-Radialis, or Supinator Radii Brevis. This muscle lies deep; it takes its origin from the exter- nal condyle of the os humeri, from the outer upper part of the ulna, and from the interosseous ligament; it is covered, in part, by the brachialis internus, and by the tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti; it is wrapt around the upper and fore part of the radius, which it turns upon its axis.â€”The supina- tor muscles are counteracted by two pronator muscles. Pronator Muscles. Epitrochlo-Radidlis, or Pronator Radii Teres. This muscle, which is placed on the inner side of the ten- don of the brachialis internus muscle, takes its origin from the internal condyle of the os humeri, and from the coronoid pro- e e 2

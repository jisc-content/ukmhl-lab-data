Like the more southern Indians, they frequently made studied speeches, when they wished to obtain a fa- vourite object. Cook*, Hearne f, Humboldt j, Lewis and Clarke j|, represent this class as having a low forehead; and, according to Humboldt, the Chaymas consider a narrow forehead as beautiful. A very interesting account of different Indians in the vi- cinity of the Rocky Mountains has been very lately publish- ed by Mr Edwin James, of which the subjoined is an ex- tract. “ In form, the Missouri Indian is symmetrical and active, and in stature equal, if not somewhat superior, to the ordi- nary European standard ; tall men are numerous. “ The forehead retires remarkably backward, and the pos- terior part of the head (occiput) has a flatness of appearance, attributable, perhaps, to the circumstance of its having rested so constantly during infancy on the surface of a board, or on the scarcely less yielding interposed pad or pillow. Yet that organ, to which, in the phrenological system, the seat of ama- tiveness is referred, although not usually very prominent, is still marked and distinct. “ The facial angle of the cranium has been represented by Blumenbach at 73°, an obliquity which induced him to place the American Indian in his series of the varieties of the human race, as the fourth in number. But his observa- tions were made upon the cranium of a Carib, than which people, as Humboldt justly remarks, “ there is no race on the globe in which the frontal bone is more depressed back- wards, or which has a less projecting forehead.” This ohser- • Captain Cook’s Description of the Natives of Nootka Sound, -f- Journey to the Frozen Ocean. $ Personal Narrative. || Travels, p. 64. when describing the Western Indians,

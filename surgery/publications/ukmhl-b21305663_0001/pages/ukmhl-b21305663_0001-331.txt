285 OF THE BONES OF THE FEET. Of the Foot. The Foot is divided into three parts, viz. Tarsus, Metatar-* sus, and Toes*: In the description of which, the several surfaces shall be named, according to their natural situation, viz. the broad of the foot, shall be called superior; the sole, inferior; the side on which the great-toe is, internal; that where the little-toe is, external. There is much variety in the size of the foot; it is larger in the male than female. The bones of the foot somewhat resemble those of the hand, but they are stronger, larger, and more strongly joined, and less calculated for motion. The tarsus consists of seven spongy bones; to-wit, the as- tragalus, os calcis, naviculare, cuboides, cuneiforme exter- num, cuneiforme medium, and cuneiforme internum. The astragalus is the uppermost of these bones. The os calcis is below the astragalus, and is considerably prominent backwards beyond the other bones of the tarsus, to form the heel. The os naviculare is in the middle of the internal side of the tarsus. The os cuboides is the most external of the row of four bones at the fore-part of the tarsus. The os cu- neiforme externum is placed at the inside of the cuboid. The cuneiforme medium is between the external and internal cu- neiform bones, and the internal cuneiform is at the internal side of the foot. In describing the bones, wherever a ridge is mentioned, without a particular use assigned, a ligament is understood to be fixed to it; or where a spongy rough cavity, depression or fossa is remarked, without naming its use, a ligament is in- serted. Of the Astragalus. The upper part of the Astragalus is slightly hollowed in the middle, and adapted to the lower end of the tibia. The head of this bone is internally flat and smooth, to play * Dr Camper has recommended, that the shoes should be wider before, and more accurately adopted to the form of the foot, in order that the toes may have more full play, and may be less cramped.

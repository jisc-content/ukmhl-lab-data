Of the Thumb. The Thumb, the antagonist of the fingers, is situated ob- liquely, in respect to them; and its bones ai'e much thicker and stronger in proportion to their length. The first bone of the thumb has its base adapted to the double pulley of the trapezium. Hence, this joint (which is thereby rendered more secure than those joints, where the head of the bone plays in an orbicular socket) may be moved in a circular direction. The edge at the fore part of this base is produced farther than any other part; and round the back part of the base a rough fossa may be seen, for the connection of the ligaments of this joint. The body and the head of this bone are of the same shape as the ossa metacarpi; but the body is shorter, and the head flatter, and the tubercles at the fore part of its root are larger. The second bone of the thumb is somewhat like the third of the fingers, and has a large base formed into an oblong cavity, whose greatest length is from one side to the other. Round it there are several tubercles for the insertion of ligaments. Its body is convex, or a half-round behind ; but flat before, for lodging the tendon of the long flexor of the thumb, which is tied down by ligamentous sheaths, that are fixed on each side to the angle at the edge of this flat surface. The lower end of this second bone has two lateral round protuberances, and a middle cavity, whose greatest extent of smooth surface is forwards. On account of the strength of the lateral ligaments, oblong figure of the joint itself, and mobility of the first joint, the joint can be bent and extended only. The bones of the fingers are arranged in three rows, named 'phalanges. All of them have half-round convex sur-

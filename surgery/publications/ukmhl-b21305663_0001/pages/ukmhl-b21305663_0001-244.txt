198 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. nial part of the skull, the more delicate bones of the Circas- sian face, the straight and elevated nose, small mouth, thin lips, and smaller teeth, which are fixed perpendicularly in the head, accord with the more delicate conformation of the bones of the face. Though the distinctions in the form of the skull had attract- ed the attention of the older authors upon anatomy and his- tory, yet they took too general a view of the subject; they did not devote that minute attention which is necessary to the full exposition of all the national peculiarities. Within the last century, the extensive regions of Asia, Africa, America, Australasia, and the Islands of the Pacific Ocean, have been explored ; many new facts, as to the form of the head, and the customs of the people, of different nations, have been brought to light, and the errors which the Jesuits and Buccaneers had propagated respecting the savage state, have been exposed and corrected. The exploring untraversed oceans (says Mr Iveate), in spite of every danger that could menace,—the discovering multitudes of islands and of people whose existence was not known before,—and the fame of fixing the geography of the southern world, were the noble fruits of this bold and ha- zardous enterprise, which will remain, to succeeding ages, a monument of the zeal and patronage of George the Third. If Mr Keate had lived to this day, he might have added, after the southern, also a northern world * The subsequent pages contain a sketch only of the dif- ferences in the conformation of the head of different na- tions. Any attempt to explain the cause or causes of these varieties of conformation, (excepting such as are purely me- chanical), must have led to a wide digression, totally foreign to the nature and limits of this elementary book, which precludes a complete and systematic view of the natural history of the form of the human head. Modern authors have not only more accurately and fully described the differences in the form of the head of the Vide Keate’s Pelew Islands, Introduction, p. 11.

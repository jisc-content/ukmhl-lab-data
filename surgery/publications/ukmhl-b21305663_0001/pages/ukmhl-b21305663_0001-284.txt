ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. 238 Of the Clavicle. The Clavicle or collar-bone is in form like to an italic S, placed nearly horizontally between the upper lateral part of the breast-bone and top of the shoulder. The clavicle is an accessory bone, tending to prevent the arm from falling forward upon the breast-bone. It also en- creases the sphere of action of the arm, by enabling it to de- scribe portions of a circle, the centre of which is the connec- tion of the clavicle with the breast-bone. The clavicle is not proper to all animals : it is not found in those quadrupeds in which the weight of the body is sup- ported by the fore legs, but only in such, as the mole, squir- rel, hedgehog, rat, sloth, and bat, that employ the fore legs as organs of apprehension, or in climbing or digging the ground, or in flying. The extremities of this bone are larger than the middle of it. The sternal extremity is of a triangular form ; the angle behind is produced, so as to form a sharp ridge, to which the transverse ligament extended from one clavicle to the other is fixed *. The side opposite to this is somewhat rounded. The middle of this protuberant end is as irregularly hol- lowed as the cavity in the sternum for receiving it is raised ; and in a recent subject, a moveable cartilage, which in struc- ture is like to the intervertebral cartilages, is interposed be- tween the extremities of the bones, and there are short and strong ligaments which secure this articulation, independently of the strong ligament which extends from the one clavicle to the other ; notwithstanding which, this end of the clavicle is sometimes dislocated. The sternal end of the clavicle, for about two-fifths of its length, is bent obliquely forwards and downwards. On the upper and fore part of this curvature, a small ridge is seen, with a plain rough surface before it; from which a â€¢ Winslow, Expos. Anat. des Os frais, p 248. Weitbrecht, Act.

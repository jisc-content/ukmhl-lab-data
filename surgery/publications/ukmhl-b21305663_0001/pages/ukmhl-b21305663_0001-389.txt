LIGAMENTS OF THE BONES OF THE FEET. 343 malleolus externus, and is fixed to]the astragalus, and the lat- ter arises from the posterior part of the malleolus externus, and is fixed to the outer and posterior part of the astragalus. There is also a ligament, which arises from the malleolus internus, the fibres of which follow a radiated course, and are fixed to the astragalus, os calcis, and os naviculare. Ligaments of the Tarsus. The astragalus is articulated by two cartilaginous planes to the os calcis. There are several short irregular ligaments which assist in uniting the above bones. There are lateral and inferior ligaments, fixing together the os calcis and os cuboides. The convex articular surface of the astragalus is received by a concave surface of the os naviculare, and three short ligaments for retaining these bones in contact. The movements of the bones of the tarsus are very limited, excepting those between the os calcis and os naviculare. The foot moves outwardly and inwardly upon the os naviculare. The os naviculare and cuboid bones may be moved up- wards and downwards to a slight degree, and the cuneiform bones move slightly on the os naviculare and on each other, by which the foot is more accurately adapted to irregularities on the ground in walking. Ligaments of the Bones of the Feet. There are transverse ligaments which unite the os navicu- lare and cuboides. There are superior, lateral, and plantar ligaments, which unite the os naviculare and os cuneiforme, and many liga- ments uniting the os cuneiforme and os cuboides. The cuneiform bones are united by many dorsal and plantar ligaments. Ligaments which connect the hones of the Tarsus and Meta- tarsus, and the Metatarsal Bones to each other. The bones of the metatarsus and tarsus, are united by cap-

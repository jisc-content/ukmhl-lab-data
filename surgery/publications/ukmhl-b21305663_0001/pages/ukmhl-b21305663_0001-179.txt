133 OF THE FllONTAL SINUSES. There is no elevation of the fore part of the frontal bone in the skull of a child at birth ; and according to Soemmering, “ primis vitae annis exigua sunt amplitudine, et peractis de- nnrni pubertatis annis, ratam amplitudinem nanciscuntur ; vel duodecimo vitae anno, non nisi vestigium eorum in infe- riore ossis parte conspicitur, eo enim loco, quem posthac occu- pant, tunc temporis nil est, nisi diploe Upon opening these sinuses, the different form of the inner and outer table of the skull is conspicuous : the former is very- irregular, and evidently moulded upon the convolutions of the brain ; but not the outer table. The two tables of the bone are not parallel to each other, a circumstance which has been long familiar to surgeons, and which renders it difficult to apply the trephine to this part of the skull. The above circumstance also demonstrates the impossibility of arriving at a precise knowledge of the exact form of this part of the brain of the adult, by an external examination of the head. The sinuses are generally equal as to size and form, and are separated by a middle partition ; sometimes they commu- nicate with each other; and, in some skulls, there are smaller partitions in each sinus, which consists of a number of cells of different forms and sizes. In the museum, there are 45 skulls of adults, cut with a view to exhibit the different sizes and forms of the frontal sinuses; and in three of these there was no appearance of frontal sinuses. The occasional total absence of frontal sinuses has escaped the observation of Palfin-|-, Bertin|, Portal ||, Soemmertxg§, Caldani^]", and other anatomists. It merits mention, that two of these were skulls of persons • De Corpor. human, fabr. vol. 1. p. 96. •f Anat. Chirurg. du Palfin, par Petit, p. 52.

PREFACE. THIS elementary work is published for the use of Students, in order to facilitate the study of Anatomy, and its collateral and dependent branches of science. Physiology, Pathology and Surgery. Some years ago I was induced, in consequence of the urgent solicitation of my pupils, and some other friends, to publish an Outline of my course of Lectures on Anatomy, that its plan and details might be more readily and fully understood. Another motive also prompted me to become an au- thor. I was then anxious, and still am so, to convince the public, and especially those friends and patrons who placed me in the honourable situation which I hold, that I have not been inattentive to the obligations it imposed on me ; and that in this instance, as in many others, I have been ambitious of treading in the foot- steps of my Father and Grandfather, who for many years filled the situation I now hold, with credit to themse’ves and advantage to their country. Another motive to publication is now superadded, — the approbation bestowed on my Outlines by the pu- blic, which has been much greater than possibly could have been anticipated, considering the limited plan on which they were constructed.

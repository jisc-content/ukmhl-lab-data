ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 562 There is also a deep short canal, which lodges the vena cava, between the right lobe and the third lobe. Of the Bloodvessels of the Liver. The liver receives blood from two very different sources, viz. from the vena portarum and the hepatic artery. The vena portae is a large vessel formed by the conjoined gastric, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric veins; but though formed by these large veins, it performs the office of an artery, and, like an artery, divides into small branches, and has coats which in thickness resemble an artery, though it has no pulsation. It is situated in the great transverse fissure of the liver, where, on account of its great size, it has been called Sinus venas portae. The branches of this vessel accompany those of the hepatic artery, and ultimately are distributed on the acini of the liver. The hepatic, a branch of the coeliac artery, divides very mi- nutely through the substance of the liver, and also sends branches to the external coat of that organ. The minuter branches of this artery are disposed somewhat like the hairs of a painterâ€™s brush, and hence these have been called the pe- nicelli of the liver. This particular distribution of vessels will be seen in the liver of the cat. The blood conveyed to the liver by the vena portarum and hepatic artery, is returned to the heart by the large veins cal- led venee cavae hepaticae, which unite with the branches of the vena portarum and hepatic artery; and, at the root of the liver, are conjoined with the vena cava, where it is about to pass through the diaphragm ; and a few of the small branches of the hepatic veins terminate in the vena cava, where it lies behind the liver. Of the Source of the Bile. The bile has been commonly stated to be secreted from venous blood, which is of a dark colour; whereas all the other secreted fluids are derived from the florid arterial blood.

OF THE clavicle. 239 part of the sterno-hyoideus and sterno-mastoideus take their rise. Near the lower angle there is a plain surface for the con- nection of the first rib, which rib and this bone are conti- guous *, and are connected by a firm ligament -f\ From this, a rough plain surface is extended outwards, which gives rise to a part of the pectoral muscle. The bone is flat, and is rough, for the insertion of the larger share of the subclavian muscle. After the clavicle begins to be bent backwards, it is round, but soon after becomes broad and thin, as far as the acromial extremity. Along the external concavity, the bone is rough, from which a part of the deltoid muscle takes its rise: Opposite to this, on the convex edge, there is a scabrous ridge, to which a share of the cucullaris muscle is fixed. The upper surface of the clavicle is flat; but the lower is hollow, and lodges the beginning of the mus- culus subclavius; and towards its back-part there is a tuber- cle, to which a strong short ligament connecting this bone to the coracoid process of the scapula is fixed. The acromial end of this bone is oblong, smooth, sloping at the posterior side, and tipped in a recent subject with a car- tilage, for its articulation with the acromion scapulas. The bone is spongy at each extremity, for the firmer connexion of the ligaments. This acromial end of the clavicle is very firmly connected with the scapula, and is very seldom separated from it by ex- ternal violence. It is evident from the situation, and form, and office, of the clavicles, that they are very liable to be broken, and when broken, the broken parts generally cross each other. A luxa- tion at the acromial extremity of the clavicle is very rare, on account of the mobility of the scapula ; whereas the dislocation at the sternal extremity is not unfrequent, on account of the shallowness of the articular cavity of the breast-bone.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 602 In a child this sac may be inflated from the foramen. In the human subject, the omentum majus, on some occa- sions, extends as far down as the navel; but in quadrupeds, whose hind legs are longer than their fore, it descends to the bottom of the belly ; which renders it probable that a liquor, which lubricates and prevents the concretion of the bowels, is derived from the omentum; though the ducts through which it flows are not visible. This organ-varies in its bulk. In the corpulent, it sometimes acquires a considerable thickness ; but in the emaciated, the greater part of its fat is abstracted, and it assumes a reticulated appearance. The under portion of this organ is loose, and readily changes its situation: hence, when the intestines are protru- ded, it frequently forms apart of the contents of a hernial sac. We are as yet totally ignorant of the use of the omenta. ; _ END OE VOL. 1. „l .to .. .. < r It . J « U • 4 ' P. Nr ill, Printer.

MUSCLES or THE THUMB. 441 the middle finger, crosses the metacarpal bone of the fore-fin- ger, and it is fixed into the root of the first bone of the thumb, on its inner side. By this muscle, the thumb is drawn to- wards the fingers. The three extensor muscles of the thumb are situated on the back-part of the fore-arm, and are concealed by the ex- tensor digitorum communis, and the extensor carpi ulnaris. Ulno-Super-Metacarpeus Pollicis, or Extensor Ossis Meta- carpi Pollicis. This muscle takes its rise from the middle of the posterior part of the ulna, radius, and interosseous ligament. It passes obliquely over the radius, and is fixed into the os trapezium, and upper and back-part of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, which it extends. Ulno-Super- Phalangeus Primus Pollicis, or Extensor Primi Internodii Pollicis. This muscle, which arises from the back-part of the ulna, and from the interosseous ligament, and is fixed into the pos- terior part of the first bone of the thumb, tends to extend the first joint of the thumb. Ulno-Super-Phalangeus Secundus Pollicis, or Extensor Secundi Internodii Pollicis. This muscle takes it origin from the middle and back-part of the ulna, and from the interosseous ligament, and is in- serted into the last joint of the thumb, which it extends. Muscles propei' to the Fore-Finger. Ulno-Super-Phalangeus Primus Indicts, or Indicator. This muscle arises from the middle and posterior part of the ulna, and the tendon of which is contained in the same sheath as the extensor digitorum communis: it is fixed into the posterior part of the fore-finger. By this muscle the finger is extended, as in pointing.

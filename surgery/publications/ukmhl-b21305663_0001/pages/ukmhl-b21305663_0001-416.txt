ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 370 or the foot, we shall suppose, resists, with the advantage of a long lever, against the muscles which serve for the flexion and extension of the elbow or knee; because, as a small degree of decurtation of the muscles is sufficient, short fibres will answer the purpose as well as long ones ; and hence, as in such oblique muscles there may be many more fibres than in longer straight muscles occupying the same space, the oblique are preferred. This resource of nature is so important, that, on recollection, you will find that there are more oblique than straight muscles in the human body, and in the bodies perhaps of all other animals ; or that, in the greater number of muscles, the fleshy fibres are shorter than the direct length between the tendons at their extremities, or between the origins and insertions of the muscles. And the number of oblique muscles is still greater in fishes and aquatic animals, as a greater force is ne- cessary to overcome the resistance of water than that of air. 2. When oblique muscles, consisting of the same number of fibres as straight muscles, are placed between two parallel lines, or between bones or other substances, which, when they are moved, remain parallel to each other, or nearly so, al- though their loss in strength be exactly in the proportion which their length bears to the direct distance between the parallel lines, yet we have found that they are capable of per- forming a much more extensive motion with the same propor- tional decurtation of fibres, or a motion of the same extent with less decurtation of fibres. Nay, that they are capable of bringing the parallel lines into contact with each other, which it is evidently impossible could be done by straight muscles. The most striking instance of this kind is found in the in- tercostal muscles; for, in this part of the body, nature, for the defence of the heart and lungs, forms the ribs as broad, and the spaces between them as narrow, as is consistent with their safety. Hence straight or perpendicular muscles between the ribs would not have had sufficient length for producing the proper motion of the ribs; and we even find, that a great de- gree of their obliquity is required to produce sufficient motion. In this part of the body we may remark another beautiful application of oblique muscles; for we find a second row of

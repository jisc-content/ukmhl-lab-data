S71 OF THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES. a a 2 oblique intercostal muscles within the first, serving two mate- rial purposes, viz. in the jirst place, That this row compen- sates for the loss of strength the first row has suffered by its obliquity; and, in the next place, That the two rows con- spiring, raise the ribs as directly upwards as could have been done by straight muscles, and press them as little forwards or backwards against their articulations as these would have done *. In various other parts of the body, but particularly in the spine, where there are many joints, and the pieces of bone and intermediate cartilages are thin, straight muscles must have been so short, and their power of contraction so small, that they could not have produced a sufficient degree of mo- tion in the joints of the spine; and hence we have found, that oblique muscles are very generally substituted instead of them. As I have demonstrated that oblique muscles can perform the same extent of motion as straight ones, not only with a smaller proportional, but with a smaller actual, decurtation of their fibres ; and, of course, that when they are contracted to the same proportional or actual degree, their motions are more extensive ; we may observe, in many cases, Avhere an in- crease of strength is chiefly intended by the obliquity of the fibres of the muscles, that they are employed also for increas- ing the extent of motion. Thus the upper and lower portions of the trapezius muscle, or the two lateral portions of the del- toid muscle co-operating, can produce more extensive motion of the scapula and of the humerus than could be done by the middle portions of these muscles. In like manner, the exter- nal and internal oblique muscles of the abdomen co-operating, appear to be capable of bending the thorax forwards in as great a degree as can be done by the recti, although their fibres are considerably shorter. 4. As the oblique muscles can, with a smaller degree of decurtation, perform the same extent of motion as a straight * This latter circumstance was distinctly remarked by Dr Mayow, De Res- piratione, p, 247, and proved experimentally by Dr Mallkk.

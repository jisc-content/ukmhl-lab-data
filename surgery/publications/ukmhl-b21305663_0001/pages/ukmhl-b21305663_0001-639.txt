OF BILIA11Y CALCULI. 593 to ascertain either its exact specific gravity, or the proportion of its constituent parts. From the experiments that were made the external part was found to consist of brown matter of bile, and the white internal of adipocire. No. 10.—The form of this calculus was globular, and its surface rough and tubercular, and of a grey colour; in ap- pearance very similar to the mulberry urinary calculus. In- ternally its colour was yellowish, with the exception of a dark brown zone. It was of specific gravity 1050, and consisted of 60. Adipocire. 10. Brown matter. 20. Bile and water. 100. No. 11.—This concretion was of an irregular globular form. Its colour externally was dull brown, with some admixture of green. Internally it was soft, radiated, and of a brown co- lour. It sunk in water. It chiefly consisted of adipocire, with a little brown matter and bile. No. 12.—The form of this calculus was ii'regular. Its co- lour externally was of a light green hue, and internally of a bright brown; and it possessed a large dark brown nucleus. It was soft, and heavier than water. It consisted of adipo- cire, and of a very small quantity of bile, and brown matter. No. 13.—This concretion, of a globular form, and nearly the size of a nutmeg, was spontaneously discharged near the umbilicus of a female. It was composed of concentric layers of radiated fibres. Its specific gravity was 1070. It con- sisted of about 85. Adipocire 1. Brown matter. 14. Bile and water. 100. « No. 14.—This concretion was of an irregular polygonal form, and both externally and internally of a yellowish white colour. Its texture was uniform, with the exception of two vol. i. p p

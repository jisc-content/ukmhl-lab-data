OF TI1E BONES. 21 CHAP. III. OF THE BONES OF THE ADULT. General Observations on the Bones of the Adult. JPhE bones are of a white, light yellow, or light brown co- lour, and opaque. In the healthy state, they are hard, com- pact, inflexible, insensible; when dried do not change their fi- gure; and do not, in favourable circumstances, for a great length of time, crumble into dust. To illustrate this fact, it may not be improper to mention, that I had occasion (5th November 1819) to examine the skeleton of Robert de Bruce, who died A. D. 1350. On opening the vault, the body was found included in thin lead (which was partially oxidated), and wrapped up in an em- broidered linen-cloth *. All the softer parts had disappeared, but the Skeleton was perfect, excepting a few of the smaller bones of the feet. The bones were somewhat moist, of an orange colour; and it was remarkable, that even the very thin bones of the orbit were quite entire, as also all the processes of the bones, at the base of the skull, even the pterygoid pro- cesses of the sphenoid bone, and the palate bones. The cricoid and thyroid cartilages of the larynx had been partially ossi- fied. The bones are covered by a membrane, named, on that account, Periosteum, to which the word externum is added, to distinguish it from a membrane which lines the bones, called Periosteum internum. The internal periosteum is much thinner than the external The processes of this membrane enter into the transverse Vide Trans, of Society of Scottish Antiquaries, vol. ii. p. 437.

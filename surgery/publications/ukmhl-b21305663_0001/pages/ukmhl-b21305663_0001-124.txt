78 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. CHAR VII. OP THE IMMOVEABLE PORTION OF THE VERTE- BRAL COLUMN. The lowest portion of the spine, or its inferior pyramid, does not contribute to the motion of the trunk of the body, nor do its component bones (the ossa coccygis excepted), move upon each other; hence these have been called false vertebrae. These immoveable vertebra constitute the back part of the pelvis or basin. Of the Pelvis. The bones of the lower part of the trunk of the body form the pelvis, which varies in its size, proportions and sym- metry, in men of the same age, nation and sex, and still more so in the different inferior animals. The pelvis should be regarded, 1st, as a firm basis, on which the bones of the trunk are moved, and also those of the in- ferior extremities; and, for this purpose, it is the firmest part of the skeleton, for its component bones are firmly fixed to each other by the form of their articulating surfaces, by nu- merous muscles, tendons, and by ligaments; and the form and size of the component bones give place to the muscles re- quisite for these several actions. 2d, As a cavity for the lodgement and defence of the or- gans of urine and generation ; for a part of the intestines and the bloodvessels, nerves and absorbent vessels, and the glands proper to these; and for the muscles which assist in dischar- ging the contents of the included bowels. 2d, As having, by the magnitude and arrangement of its several parts, a reference tolhe erect posture, for which pur-

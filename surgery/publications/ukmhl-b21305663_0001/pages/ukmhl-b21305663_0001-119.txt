73 OF THE VERTEBRAE. body of each vertebra for receiving the heads of the ribs, seems to vary in the following manner: The depression on the upper edge of each vertebra decreases as far down as the fourth, and alter that increases. The transverse processes are longer in each lower vertebra to the seventh or eighth, with their smooth surfaces, for the tuberdes of the ribs, facing gradually more downwards; but afterwards as they descend they become shorter, and the smooth surfaces are directed more upwards. The spinous processes of the vertebrae of the back become gradually longer and more slanting from the first as far down as the eighth or ninth vertebra; from which they manifestly turn shorter and more erect. The first vertebra, besides an oblong hollow in its lower edge, that assists in forming the cavity wherein the second rib is received, has the whole cavity for the head of the first rib formed in it. The second has the name of axillary, without any thing particular in its structure. The eleventh * often has the whole cavity for the eleventh rib in its body, and wants the smooth surface on each trans- verse process. The twelfth *f* always receives the whole head of the last rib, and has no smooth surface on its transverse processes, which are very short. The smooth surfaces of its inferior oblique processes, face outwards. In short, the upper vertebrae of the back resemble those on the neck ; and the lower ones those of the loins. Lumbar Vertebra. The lumbar are the lowest of the five true vertebra, which may be distinguished from the others. 1. Their bodies, though of a circular form at their fore part, are somewhat oblong from one side to the other. The epiphyses on their edges are larger, and therefore the upper * in neutram partem inclinans. t AixruTTtie, praecingens.

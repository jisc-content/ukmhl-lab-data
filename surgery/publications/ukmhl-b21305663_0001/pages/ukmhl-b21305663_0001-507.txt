MUSCLES OF THE TOES. 461 crosses these, and arises from the upper and anterior part of the os calcis, from the os cuboides and astragalus; it then di- vides into four distinct muscles, which are inserted into the first phalanx of the great toe, and into all the other toes, ex- cepting the little toe. Peroneo-Super- Unguialis, or Extensor Longus Pollicis Pedis. This muscle, which is hid between the tibialis anticus, and extensor digitorum longus, takes its origin from the fibula and interos. eous ligament: its tendon passes over the forepart of the astragalus and os naviculare, and is fixed into the base of the first and second phalanges of the great toe. This muscle not only extends the great toe, but also bends the ankle. There are also three jiexor muscles of the toes; viz. Tibio-Subunguialis, or Flexor Longus Digitorum Pedis. This muscle, which lies under the soleus, arises from the posterior and flattened portion of the tibia; below the soleus muscle, the fibres pass obliquely into a tendon, which is situ- ated on the posterior edge of the muscle. The tendon is lodged within a groove behind the inner ankle, and bound down by a strong ligament. This muscle divides in the sole of the foot into four ten- dons, which pass through slits in the tendons of the flexor digitorum brevis, and which are inserted into the last joint of the lesser toes. By this muscle all the joints are bent, but chiefly the last joint. Flexor Digitorum Accessorius, or Massa Carnea Sylvii. This broad and flat muscle, which is connected by two por- tions to the os calcis, is fixed into the tendons of the preced- ing muscle, and assists in bending the toes. Planto-Sub-Phalungei, or Lumbricales. The lumbricales are four thin portions of muscles, which

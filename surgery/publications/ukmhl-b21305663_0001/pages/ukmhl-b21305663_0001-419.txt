373 OF THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES. them; or we may compare the pair of oblique muscles to the outer sticks of a spread fan, and the variety of the directions of the motions they are capable of producing, to the co-opera- tions of intermediate sticks of the fan. In consequence of this motion in diagonal lines, the four recti muscles of the eye-ball enable us to follow an object moving before us in a circle. Antagonist Muscles. In a former page, it was observed, that there were antago- nist muscles, Flexor and Extensor muscles, which act by an opposite pull. Such a disposition of the muscles is conducive not only to the reciprocal energetic motion of the limbs, but also to their symmetry. Thus after the flexor muscles of the fore-arm have bent it, the extensor muscles act, and extend and straighten it. The flexor muscles are generally stronger than the extensors, owing to their fibres being more numer- ous, and to their being inserted further from the centre of motion: hence, during sleep, the limbs are generally some- what bent. Velocity of'Muscular Action. The velocity and precision of muscular action are very re- markable ; and of these there are many striking examples, as in speaking, writing, running, &c. Effect of Custom on Muscular Action. Custom exercises its sway over the muscles. The bladder of urine affords an example of the effects of custom. Some persons retain a large quantity of urine in it, but others have a call to make water when it contains only a few ounces of urine. Effects of Imitation and Sympathy upon Muscular Action. Imitation is a very useful agent in instructing us in per- forming many actions. Thus the child learns to speak, use its limbs, &c. In early life, it is equally independent of rea- son and reflection, and even takes place in direct opposition

OF THE MUSCLES OF THE OS HYOIDES. 391 Omo-Hyoideus. This thin and flat muscle arises from the superior costa of the scapula. It ascends obliquely forwards and inwards; and, when under the sterno-mastoid muscle, it is tendinous; it again becomes fleshy, and is at length fixed into the lower margin of the base of the os hyoides. This muscle draws the os hyoides obliquely downwards and backwards. Sterno-Hyoideiis. This thin and flat muscle, which arises from the outer part of the uppermost bone of the sternum, from the first rib and from the clavicle, and covering the lateral surfaces of the tra- chea, is at length inserted into the middle of the lower edge of the basis of the os hyoides, near to the insertion of the omo-hyoideus muscle. S ter no- Thyroideus. This muscle is shorter and broader than the preceding mus- cles, and placed beneath the former, with which it has a simi- lar origin. The jugular vein, the carotid artery, the trachea, the thyroid gland and its vessels, lie under this muscle. The muscle terminates in the wing of the thyroid cartilage. Hyo- Thyroideus. This muscle is the continuation of the preceding; it arises from the wing of the thyroid cartilage, and ascending, is fixed to the base and cornu of the os hyoides. This, like the preceding muscle, dx*aws towards each other the os hyoides and larynx. Stylo-Hyoideus. This muscle takes its rise from the styloid process of the temporal bone: it descends obliquely downwards and for- wards, and is fixed to the cornu of the os hyoides at its junc- tion with the body of the bone. The digastric generally passes through this muscle. This muscle draws the os hy- oides upwards and to one side.

The synovial apparatus of this joint is of great extent * When traced from above, it is reflected from the condyles of the thigh-bone, to the circumference of the knee-pan. In this part it is loose, and covered above by loose fat. After lining the posterior surface of the patella, it passes on the upper edge of the tibia, and covers the articular cartilages. Ligaments between the Tibia and Fibula. The upper extremity of the fibula, is connected by a cap- sular ligament to the outer surface of the tibia, by the exter- nal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, and by the tendon of the biceps flexor cruris, which is fixed to the fibula. There is a strong interosseous ligament, composed of ob- lique fibres, which extends between the ridge at the back part of the tibia, and the corresponding ridge at the inner side of the fibula. There being a large aperture in the upper part of the in- terosseous ligament, the muscles of the fore and back part of the leg are in contact; several small bloodvessels pass to the fore-part of the leg, through the interosseous ligament. There are several ligaments which unite the inferior extre- mity of the fibula and tibia. Ligaments connecting the Bones of the Leg and Tarsus. The capsular ligament, which is fixed to the margin of the articular cavity of the tibia, fibula, and astragalus, is very thin, especially before and behind. It is strengthened, as Caldani has represented in fig. 6. of his 59th Plate, by an upper and under ligament, passing from the lower and back part of the tibia to the fibula; by a perpendicular ligament which passes from the malleolus ex- ternus, to the os calcis; by an anterior and a posterior liga- ment, the former of which arises from the anterior part of the * Vide Monro on the Bursa: Mucosae, Plate viii, fig. 5, 6, 9, and 10. ; in which this apparatus is seen, of its natural size, and also much magnified.

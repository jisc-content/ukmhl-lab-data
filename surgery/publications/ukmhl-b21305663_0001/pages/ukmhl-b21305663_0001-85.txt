VESSELS OE THE BONES. 39 The arteries are larger near each end than at the middle of the large bones, because they are not only distributed up- on the bony plates near the ends, but pass through them to the marrow. There are many more bloodvessels in the bone of a young man than in those of an old, and especially in that part which is in a state of growth. There are also branches of the medullary artery, which an- astomose with the arteries above named ; hence, by a fracture no part of the bone is deprived of blood ; hence, also, when suppuration takes place within bones, though the cancelli of the bone and marrow are destroyed, the bone still continues to live. The arteries of bones have their corresponding veins. Ly mphatic Vessels of Bones. We cannot trace these vessels into the substance of the bones. From what has been said of the vessels of bones, it is evi- dent, that there is a constant circulation of fluids in every part of them; and that there is a perpetual waste and renewal of the particles which compose the solid fibres of bones, as well as of other parts of the body; the addition from the fluids ex- ceeding the waste during the growth of the bones; the renew- al and waste keeping pretty near par in adult middle age; and the waste exceeding the supply in old age; as is demon- strable from their weight. For each bone increases in weight as a person approaches to maturity; continues of nearly the same weight till old age begins, and then becomes lighter. The specific gravity of the solid sides, on the contrary, in- creases by age, for then they become more hard, compact and dense. In consequence of this, the bones of old people are thinner and firmer in their sides, and .have larger cavities than those of younger persons. That lymphatic vessels arc proper to bones is obvious, from the phenomena which take place during the formation of bone; from the red colour which is communicated to bones

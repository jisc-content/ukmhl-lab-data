183 OF THE SKULL. TABLE of Mean Diameters of Heads. For a Child of 1 year 51 inches. 2 years 4 years 7 years 12 years 6§ It then varies little till 12. 16 to IS Adults 7 1 Largest 7j to 8§ “ Servants’ heads generally small 6| to 7^; also Negroes heads are small. Womens heads are more roundish than mens.” “ From this Table and Dr Monro’s, taken in comparison, it appears, that at seven years the head has attained only the same size as the brain exhibits in adults. The brain, there- fore, within the head ought at seven years to have attained its Dr Soemmering, who has devoted the most minute atten- tion to the size of the head in very early life, has. observed, “ Quo junior embryo, eo majus est volumen capitis ad trun- cum collati, sive, quod eodem redit, truncus tunc temporis minimus apparet. Omnium ergo maximum est caput illo tem- pore, quo primum illud conspicere vel distinguere licet. In embryone primo caput truncum magnitudine tantum sequat, in tertio truncus magnitudinem capitis superat. Post men- sem primum sensim minus laete caput crescit, adeo ut rationem incrementi trunci propius accedat, quemadmodum in em- bryone quinquemestri caput ratione trunci non adeo grande videmus. Facies eo minor ad cerebri conceptaculum est, quo junior embryo.” There is no part of the human skeleton which is more va- riable in its shape, and the proportion of its several parts, than the skull, even amongst the inhabitants of the same nation. Some of the causes of these very remarkable differences in the skull may be readily explained. full size.”

LIGAMENTS OF THE CARPUS. S$f} gin of the glenoid cavity of the radius, and the cartilaginous edges of the os scaphoides, liinare, and cuneiforme. There are two lateral ligaments, one placed between the styloid process of the radius, and the os naviculare, and the other, between the styloid process of the ulna, and the cunei- form and pisiform bones. There is also an internal mucous ligament within the joint, which extends between the two first bones of the carpus, and the radius. The joint, at the wrist, is strengthened by the tendons of the muscles fixed near to it, and also by the tendinous mem- branes, which fix down the tendons of the flexor and extensor muscles of the fingers. Ligaments of the Carpus. All the bones of the carpus are connected, being lined by a continuous synovial membrane. The ligaments called annular, formed by the aponeurosis of the muscles, have been already described. The bones of the carpus are firmly united before and be- hind, by ligamentous fibres; those on the back of the hand are the strongest. There is a capsular ligament between the upper and under rows of bones which compose the carpus, which is strength- ened by a great number of short ligamentous fibres, which cross the capsular ligament in different directions, and have been called oblique, transverse, and perpendicular ligaments. The os pisiforme is detached from the other bones of the carpus: it lies on a concave surface of the cuneiform bone, and has its proper synovial membrane and proper ligaments: it is also fixed in its place by the abductor muscle of the little finger. Ligaments between the Carpal and Metacarpal Bones. The second row of the carpal bones is united to the neigh- bouring bones by capsular ligaments; and there are various additional ligamentous fibres, which have been named oblique, or straight ligaments, from the direction of their fibres.

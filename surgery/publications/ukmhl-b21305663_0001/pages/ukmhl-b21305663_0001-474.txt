This muscle, which lies immediately under the skin, and covers all the muscles of the posterior part of the neck, and upper part of the back, adheres to its fellow for the whole length of its origin. The ligamentum nuchae, which is of great strength in the larger quadrupeds, arises from the middle of the occipital bone, and adheres to the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae. Some of the fibres of this muscle take their rise from this strong ligament, and also from the middle of the occipital arch, from the corresponding muscle, over the spinous pro- cesses of the cervical vertebrae, from the spinous processes of the two inferior cervical, and all those of the dorsal vertebrae; and are inserted into the whole of the spine of the scapula, the acromion scapulae, and the scapulary part of the clavicle. The different portions of this muscle are subservient to diffe- rent purposes: the superior part raises the shoulder; the lower part pulls it downwards; the middle portion draws the shoulders towards each other; and when the scapulae are fixed, this muscle assists in moving the head backwards. Dorso-Scapularis, or Rhomboideus. This muscle, which lies beneath the trapezius and latissi- mus dorsi, arises from the spinous processes of the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical vertebrae, and the four uppermost dorsal vertebrae is fixed into the whole length of the base of the sca- pula, and tends to draw the scapula backwards and upwards. Costo-ClaviiLS, or Subclavius. This muscle fills up the space between the clavicle and first rib ; it arises from the cartilage of the first rib, and is fixed into the under surface of the clavicle, as far as the co- racoid process of the scapula. It pulls the clavicle down.

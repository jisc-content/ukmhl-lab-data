MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD. 421 This muscle arises from the transverse processes of the 8th, 9th, and 10th dorsal vertebrae, and is fixed into the spinous processes of the two last cervical, and five first dorsal verte- bra5, by tendons: it serves to pull the spine obliquely back- wards. Besides the above muscles, there are two rows of muscular fibres between the spinous processes, and also between the transverse processes, called Inter-Spinales and Inter-Trans- versales, and there are also muscular and tendinous fibres which arise from the spinous processes of the os sacrum, from the oblique and transverse processes of the lumbar and dorsal vertebrae; and from the four lowest cervical vertebras. These fibres are fixed by distinct tendons into the spinous pro- cesses of all the vertebrae, with the exception of the first, and constitute the multifidus spinae of some authors. These muscular fibres draw the spine directly backwards. SECTION IV. OF THE MUSCLES WHICH MOVE THE HEAD. Movements of the Head. The head is articulated with the atlas, or first vertebra of the neck, by a gmglymus joint, on which it is moved back- wards and forwards, and it is nearly equipoised on the atlas. It is rather heavier before, and hence inclines forwards when a person falls asleep. The foramen magnum ossis occipitis, is parallel to the palate ; hence, in our erect posture, the eyes and mouth are directed forwards. The head, with the second vertebra of the neck, rotates in a horizontal direction on the tooth-like process of the second vertebra of the neck ; and the breadth of the articulating fur- face, and looseness of the synovial membrane, admit of con- siderable rotatory motion from right to left. The motions of the head are very limited ; this is compen- sated to a certain degree by the cervical vertebrae, which move along with the head.

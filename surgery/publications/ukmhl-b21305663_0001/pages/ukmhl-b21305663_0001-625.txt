A favourable opportunity occurred for examining bile, which Dr John Davy examined at my request. I have subjoined his account of it in his own words. “ Healthy Bile obtained from a person executed. “ This bile appeared, by transmitted light, of a fine golden yellow colour, darker and richer than the healthy bile of the ox ; and by reflected light it assumed the hue of burnt timber. It’was rather more viscid, and also of greater specific gravity, than the ox-bile. The former, water being as 100, was found to be as 104.25, and the latter 102.75. “ It had nothing peculiar in its general properties, or diffe- rent from those commonly observed. One hundred grains of it, slowly evaporated to dryness, afforded fifteen grains of solid residue, of a resinous appear- ance, and of a dark brown colour. “ This residuum, treated with alcohol, was completely dis- solved, with the exception of 1.5 grain, which had the pro- perties of albumen. “ The quantity examined was not sufficient for minuter analysis.” From the preceding results it may be concluded, that 100 parts of this human bile contain about 86.0 Water. 12.5 Resin of Bile. 1.5 Albumen. 100.0 o o 2

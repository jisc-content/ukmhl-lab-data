429 MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDE1L Scapulo-Hyoideus, or Omo-hyoideus. This muscle arises from the superior costa of the scapula, and passes obliquely upwards and forwards under the sterno- mastoideus, under which it becomes tendinous, and is fixed into the base of the os hyoides, at the side of the sterno-hy- oideus. By this muscle the os hyoides is pulled down to one side and when both muscles act, the os hyoides is drawn directly downwards. SECTION X. MUSCLES OF THE ARM. The muscles of the arm arise from the trunk of the body, or from the processes of the scapula. Sterno-humeralis, or Pectoralis Major. This muscle covers the front of the breast, and is the first muscle which comes into view, after having removed the skin, fat and, cellular substance, and the origins of the platysma myoides. It takes its rise from the sternal portion of the clavicle, and the cartilages of the 5th and 6th ribs, and is fixed by a flat twisted tendon, into the ridge which bounds the outer edge of the groove for the tendons of the long head of the scapulo-radialis muscle. This muscle is separated from the deltoid muscle by a good deal of cellular substance and fat, and generally by the cephalic vein. By this muscle, the humerus is brought forward, and the arm thrown across the breast, when it hangs by the side ; but, if the arm has been raised, this muscle draws it downwards, and at the same time forwards. Lumbo-Humeralis, or Latissimus Dorsi. This thin and broad muscle, which covers the greater share of the back-part of the trunk of the body, takes its rise from the os sacrum, crest of the os ilium, and spinous pro-

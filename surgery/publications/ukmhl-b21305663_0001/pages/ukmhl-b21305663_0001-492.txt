446 elements of anatomy. But in the inferior animals, the glutaei muscles are of very small size, and hence they can scarcely be said to have hips. The extensor muscles of the knee are also of singular strength in man, and are not inserted so low into the tibia as in the monkey tribe ; and hence he is capable of more fully extending his knee. These muscles also bring the thigh for- wards on the leg, which is essential to the mode in which men Avalk and run. Man is also distinguished from the inferior ani- mals by the greater size of the calves of his legs, the muscles of which counteract the tendency of the weight of the body to bend the leg in our erect position, and, in raising the heel bone, are powerful agents in progressive motion. In short, the disposition of the muscles of the inferior ex- tremities, shews, that man is intended for the erect position, and that he only is capable of maintaining his body in that position for a considerable time, without great fatigue. Ilio-Costalis, or Quadratus Lumborum. This muscle takes its origin from the lateral and posterior half of the spine of the os ilium, between the origins of the psoas inagnus, and transversalis abdominis : it is inserted into the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, into the posterior part of the last rib, and into the side of the last vertebrae of the back. By this muscle, the last rib is pulled down, as in difficult expiration; and when the muscles of both sides are at the same time thrown into action, the loins are bent. SECTION XVII. OF THE TENDINOUS APONEUROSIS OF THE INFERIOR EXTRE- MITY", AND MUSCLE PROPER TO IT. At present it is proposed to describe in very general terms the tendinous aponeurosis of the inferior extremity. The fascia of the thigh, which has been called fascia lata, is made up partly of tendinous, and partly of ligamentous fibres.

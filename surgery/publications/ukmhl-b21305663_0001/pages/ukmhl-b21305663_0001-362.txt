ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 316 deliquesce, though they rendered turmeric paper brown, it may be concluded that the quantity of alkali present was very small. The coal, after the separation of the common salt, was digested in dilute nitric acid. Ammonia afterwards added, oc- casioned a slight cloudiness, indicating a very minute propor- tion only of phosphate of lime. “ From the results of these experiments, 100 parts of sy- novia seem to contain— 98.3 water. .93 gelatine and mucilage. .53 albumen. .23 common salt. — traces of fixed alkali and phosphate of lime. 100.00” Of the Source of the Synovia. The synovia, as to its use, has been compared to oil. In machines made by human art a certain quantity of oil is ap- plied where it is necessary, but in the joints of the human body the greater the necessity for a supply of synovia, the great- er the quantity of it which is secreted. The organs which pour out synovia are exposed to agita- tion, but are defended from injury when the joint is moved, and in different joints in different ways. Thus, in the case of the inferior extremity, the capsular ligament is drawn out by the round cord, and the synovial apparatus is pressed in- wards by the head of the bone. In the knee joint the syno- vial apparatus is connected with the moveable patella, which in every flexion and extension of the joint is moved; and at the ankle joint the synovial apparatus is affected from being placed between two firm bones. The synovial apparatus may, however, be injured by external violence; thus, by a blow upon the trochanter major the head of the thigh-bone may be

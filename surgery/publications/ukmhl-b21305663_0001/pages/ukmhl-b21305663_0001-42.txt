XXXVI PREFACE. The Plates which illustrate the structure of the Ovaria, were copied from drawings made forty years ago,—a fact of which it seems necessary to make particular mention, as they bear some resemblance to those of Sir Everard Home. In describing the course of the Arteries and Veins, I have directed the attention of the reader chiefly to the larger branches, the course of which it is of great moment to understand, as they are liable to be wound- ed, and to become diseased; for the relief of which the aid of the surgeon is required. I have inserted, in their own words, Sir Astley Cooper’s mode of operating for the cure of Carotid Aneurism ;—the operation of Hedenus of Berlin for extirpating the Thyroid Gland;—Mr Coats’s method of taking up the Thyroidal Artery ;—the ob- servations of Professor Colles of Dublin, and of Mr Liston of this city, on taking up the Subclavian Artery:—the observations of Mr J. Hunter, Mr Abernethy, and Sir Astley Cooper on Iliac and Popliteal Aneurisms. To the description of the Veins of the Superior Extremities, are appended some remarks upon the operation of Venesection, and the consequences which sometimes flow from that operation ; and also re- specting the consequences of slight wounds of the fingers, which sometimes prove fatal. I have concluded this part of my Work, by an account of Dr Par- ry’s observations on the formation of new arteries, when a ligature has been put upon the trunk of an ar- tery, and by describing the distribution of the arteries and veins upon the face of a stump,—of which, as far as I know, no account has hitherto been published.

OF THE OS CUBOIDES. 289 ness of these ligaments causes sometimes an unnatural turn of the fore-part of the foot inwards *. . The os naviculare is wholly cartilaginous in a new-born infant. Of the Os Cuboides. The Os Cuboides is a very irregular cube, which, behind, is moulded into an oblong unequal concavity, adapted to the fore-part of the os calcis. There is a small semicircular smooth cavity on the inner side of this bone, where it is join- ed to the os naviculare; immediately before which, an oblong smooth plane is made by the os cuneiformÂ© externum. Be- low this, the bone is hollow and rough. On the internal side of the lower surface, a round protuberance and fossa are found, for the origin of the musculus adductor pollicis. On the external side of this same surface, there is a round knob, covered with cartilage; immediately before which, a smooth fossa may be observed, in which the tendon of the peronaeus longus passes obliquely across the foot; and on the knob, the thin flat cartilage proper to this muscle plays; in place of which sometimes a bone is found : More externally than the knob, there is a rough hollow, for the strong ligaments stretched betwixt this bone and the os calcis. Before, the surface of the os cuboides is flat, smooth, and slightly divided into two planes, for sustaining the os metatarsi of the little toe, and of the toe next to it. The form of the back-part of the os cuboides, and the li- gaments connecting the joint there with the os calcis, con- cur in allowing little motion in this part. If a weight bears on an arch, that arch is either supported at the sides, or these sides are joined together. It is in the latter way that this joint is secured. When this ligament is sprained or torn, it generally brings on a tedious or incurable lameness. The ossification of this bone is scarcely begun at birth. * The deformity in cases of club-foot is chiefly owing to the distortion of the os naviculare. VOI.. i. T

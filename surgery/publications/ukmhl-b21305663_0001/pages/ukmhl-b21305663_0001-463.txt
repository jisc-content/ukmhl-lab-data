MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 417 species of incarceration dependent on a narrowing of the in- ternal orifice of the canal.‚Äù A part of the muscles of the abdomen is sometimes awanting at the navel, of which I have seen several instances in children. It also sometimes happens, that there is a de- fect of the smaller tendinous columns which form the ingui- nal canal, so that when the bowels are protruded at the under abdominal aperture, the hernia is situated at the common place of a crural hernia. SECTION III. MUSCLES SITUATED UPON THE BACK-PART OF THE TRUNK OF THE BODY.

Albinus has divided the muscles of the back into four layers. 1st Layer. There are two muscles which cover the whole of the back, the dorso-acromialis, or trapezius, and the lumbo-hume- ralis, or latissimus dorsi. 2d Layer. NEW NAMES.

51 OF THE FORMATION OF RONE. loss of silica, or the exact quantity of carbonate of lime that was gained. To me it seems much more probable, that the bony matter which is about to be deposited is held in solution by an acid, probably by the phosphoric acid, which is abstracted from it by the absorbent vessels, or that the bony matter is mixed largely with the lymph. This opinion seems to be con- firmed by the appearance oi a bone soon aftei it has been formed, as I have seen in persons who have died while labour- ing under the disease necrosis. The new formed bone, which supplies the place of the old dead bone, is extremely soft and irregular on its surface; an appearance which the egg also assumes, when within the womb of the hen, or an elephant s tooth, while lodged below the gum. In consequence of the advancement of the bony process, the bone becomes smooth on its surface, owing to the filling up of the interstices. Of the Source of Bone. This subject has been much agitated by physiologists, and has given rise to much contrariety of opinion. According to some authors, the bone is derived from the vessels of the pe- riosteum ; and according to others, from the arteries proper to the substance of the bones. Mr Du Hamel, a strtnuous supporter of the first of the above hypotheses, supposed that the layers of the periosteum were gradually converted into bone, in the same manner as timber is formed by the hardening of the white substance be- tween the inner bark and the wood. He endeavoured to give weight to his favourite theory, by feeding animals with mad- der for a time, and then on ordinary food, by which the bones were rendered alternately white and red. That the vessels of the periosteum form bone is rendered probable from the effect of external violence, which is in some cases followed by the destruction and exfoliation of the exter- nal layers of the bone, and in others, by a new growth of bone, which includes the original bone which has been re- d 2

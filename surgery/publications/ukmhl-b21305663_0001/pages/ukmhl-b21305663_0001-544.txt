498 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. the sphenoid bone, behind the foramen ovale, and from the osseous part of the Eustachian tube and the internal pterygoid process : it then sends out a tendon, which revolves around the hook-like process of the internal pterygoid process; and is fixed into the middle of the velum palati, and semilunar edge of the os palati, by means of a broad membrane. This muscle expands the velum laterally, and also tends to depress it. Palato- Uvularis, or Azygos Uvula. This muscle is enclosed within the membrane of the Uvula. It arises from the back part of the palate bones, and termi- nates in the Uvula, which it draws upwards. Glosso-Palatinns, or Constrictor Isthmi Faucium. This muscle is contained within the anterior arch of the soft palate. It consists of a few thin muscular fibres, w hich a- rise from the side of the root of the tongue, and is fixed into the middle of the velum palati. This muscle shuts the open- ing into the fauces. Pharyngo-Palatinus, or Palato-Pharyngeus. This muscle is composed of a thin stratum of muscular fibres, which are covered by the membrane of the posterior fold of the soft palate. This muscle arises from the insertion of the circumflexus palati, and the root, of the uvula. This muscle is fixed into the middle constrictors of the pharynx, and into the upper and back part of the thyroid cartilage. By these muscular fibres, the velum and uvula are drawn downwards, by which the passage into the nostrils is shut du- ring deglutition ; and they also assist in propelling the food into the fauces.

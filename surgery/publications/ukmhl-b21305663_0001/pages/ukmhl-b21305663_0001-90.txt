ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. 44 CHAP. V. OF FCETAL BONES. Bones do not enter into the original composition of the human frame. Upon examining a very young foetus, we ob- serve that it is composed chiefly of a membranous or cartila- ginous substance, which has nearly the same form as the hone, and upon this basis a number of bloodvessels may be obser- ved after a successful injection of the bloodvessels, which are much enlarged where ossification commences. Upon examin- ing with attention what takes place in the earlier stages of ossification, we observe small grains, connected with the ar- teries of the part, deposited in an irregular manner : these are gradually united, so as to form fine fibres ; which fibres are disposed differently in different bones, and become more nu- merous, and being crossed by smaller fibres, form a sort of net-work. The fibres are more numerous and more closely compacted towards the middle of the bones : hence a centre or centres of ossification have been described. These appear- ances may be observed, not only in the healthy, but also in the diseased state of the bones; in the latter, they are more con- spicuous, as being carried on upon a larger scale, as in cases of hydrocephalus chronicus, exostoses, necroses, ossification of the dura mater, and also in the process of the re-union of frac- tured bones. After a time, the fibrous appearance is by no means obvious, the interstices between the fibres being in the progress of ossification filled up. The process of ossification is more rapid, .aud is sooner com- pleted in quadrupeds and birds, than in man ; whereas in other animals, as in the whale and alligator, it goes on during the whole of life. It merits, however, particular mention, that even the process of ossification docs not go on with equal

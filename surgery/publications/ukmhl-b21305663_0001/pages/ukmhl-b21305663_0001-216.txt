ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 170 by the spinous suture; by their sockets, to the teeLh by goni- phosis; by the internal edge of the palate-plate, to one another, by the longitudinal palate suture, on the upper and fore-part of which a furrow is left for receiving the cartilage which forms the partition of the nostrils ; between the fore- part of the nostrils and mouth, to each other, by the my- stachial suture ; sometimes they are connected to the ossa spongiosa inferiora, by a plain concretion of union of sub- stance. In each of the maxillary bones, of a newborn child, the ex- ternal orbitar process is hollow, with remarkable holes in it; there are five sockets for the teeth, of which the two posterior are very large, and, when divided by a second cross partition, make the number of sockets six *. The palate plate is cri- briform about the middle. The superior maxillary bone is much shorter in the foetus than in the adult, and the palatine process of it, instead of being arched, is nearly flat, and on a level with the alveolar surface. There is scarcely an appearance of the antrum maxillare; hence the remarkable change produced upon the face by the expansion of that sinus; the nose is raised, and is lengthened ; the cheek bones become prominent, and, by the addition of the teeth, the face becomes much longer. In some mammalia, there is a wedge-shaped bone, or two bones, which contain the incisor teeth, which has been called, therefore, the intermaxillary bone, or ossa incisiva. But as this or these bones are found in the elephant, ant-eater, and in some whales, that have not incisor teeth, the intermaxillary is the more appropriate name. Dr Camper and Blum ex bach found this bone in some, but not in all the simiae. Ossa Palati. These bones form the back-part of the palate, nostrils, or- bits, pterygoid fossae, and cover part of the maxillary, sphe- noidal, and ethmoidal sinuses. Each palate-bone may be di- โข Aibin.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. .500 fulcire I have sometimes seen the tongue adhering to the cheek, which had probably been the consequence of previous inflammation. In the greater number of quadrupeds the tongue is larger and narrower than in man; is long and flexible, and assists them in seizing their prey, as in the ant-eaters ; but in the cetacea it is fixed down to the jaw. The tongue has been divided by anatomists into three parts, viz. a base, body, and point; and into two surfaces, an upper and under. The tongue is connected by a doubling of the skin called Frecnum Lingua;; and its sides are fixed to the styloid processes* and to the lower jaw by ligament. The froenum lingua? is sometimes so short, that the child cannot suck well. There is a line which runs in a longitudinal direction along the tongue; and towards the root of this organ there is an oval-shaped depression, called, after Morgagni, Foramen Cacum Morgagni. The tongue is covered by a cuticle, which forms sheaths for its papillae, by corpus mucosum and cutis vera. The cu- ticle of the tongue, in consequence of fever, sometimes attains an unnatural thickness, and after a time comes off in thick flakes. The papillae of the tongue, on account of their size, have been arranged into three classes. The Papilla Maxima, or Lenticulares, which are perfora- ted in the middle, occupy the base of the tongue, and are small salivary glands. The Papillae Mediae, or Semi-lenticularcs, which are sup- ported on a small stalk, are scattered over the middle of the upper surface of the tongue. The Papillae Minima?, or Conicce, are found chiefly at and near to the point of the tongue. In t herbaceous animals, the tongue is covered by a thick cuticle, which forms a number of papillae, which are directed Vide Obs. Med. Chir. Fascic. p. 142.

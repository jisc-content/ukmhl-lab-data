MUSCLES OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. 449 able, this cushion of fat, according to Mr Barrow, is not formed until the first pregnancy. The glutaeus is one of the most powerful muscles by which the body is kept erect; and counteracts the effect of the weight of the body, which tends to make the ossa innominata move backwards on the thigh-bones. Ilio-Trochanterus major, or Glutceus Medius. This muscle, which lies under the former, excepting at its anterior part, where it is covered only by fascia, arises from the circumference and outer edge of the dorsum of the os ilium ; and its radiated fibres are collected and inserted into the up- per part of the trochanter. By the above, and the two following muscles, the thigh is rotated outwards. Ilio-Trochanterus minor, or Glutaeus Minimus. This muscle arises from the anterior and inferior part of the os ilium; the fibres of the muscle run in a radiated manner, and are inserted by a thin and broad tendon, into the anterior and superior part of the trochanter major. Sacro-Trochanterus, or Piriformis. This muscle arises from the inner side of the second, third, and fourth pieces of the os sacrum; passes out of the pelvis, above the upper sacro-sciatic ligament, and is fixed by a strong round tendon, into the top of the great trochanter. This muscle is covered by the glutteus maxim us, and me- dius muscles. Sub-Pubo-Trochanterus, or Obturator Internus. This muscle extends between the internal part of the mem- brane which fills up the foramen obturatorium, and the great trochanter. The inside of this muscle is covered by a portion of the levator ani; and its tendon passes in a groove between the tuberosity of the ischium and spinous process of that bone, and revolves upon the posterior edge of the ischium, between the two following muscles. vol. i. rf

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 482 of lime, and of 4 of carbonate of lime, of jelly 28; and the water of composition and loss, amounted to 10 *. This bony part differs from other bone in not being cellular. According to Bekzelius, the osseous substance of the teeth consists of, Phosphate of lime, 61.95 Fluate of lime, 2.10 Carbonate of lime, 5.50 Phosphate of magnesia, 1.05 Soda, with a little muriate of soda, 1.40 Gelatine, water, &c., 28.00 loot The bony part of the teeth is much more incorruptible than common bone. I have seen human teeth quite entire, which had lain in the ground for 500 years, whilst the other bones had crumbled down into dust. Teeth also are not affected by rickets; they are not, like the other bones, rendered soft by that disease. The teeth are amply furnished with bloodvessels, which may be filled with a colouring liquor, and, if divided, pour out blood, as the teeth are sawn across by the dentist. As a further proof of the vascularity of the teeth, Nodes sometimes form on them ; and the roots are sometimes joined together by Anchylosis. The teeth have also Lymphatic Vessels. Though the Lymphatic Vessels of the teeth cannot be de- monstrated, there are various facts which prove their exist- ence, viz. the absorption of the roots of the first set of teeth, the colour given to the osseous part of the teeth by madder being removed after discontinuing the use of it, and the swell- ing of the lymphatic glands from a carious tooth. This fact is still farther proved by the changes which the teeth undergo during the lifetime of the animal, which are very remarkable in the elephant. â€¢ Vide Fox on the Teeth. -f- Vide Nicholson's Journal, vol. xviii. p- 75.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 55 2 dilated or contracted portions, we soon discover a part of tlie canal which seems much contracted, as by a cord having been put around it, and which had left a purple mark : upon pres- sing this part, it feels heavy and hard. Strictures generally take place at that part of the canal which is naturally most contracted. The part above the stricture is much extended, often in- flamed, ulcerated, and sometimes eroded. Of Chylification, or of the changes which the Food undergoes within the Duodenum. The food within the intestines is changed into an excre- mentitious and useless part; and into a chylous or nutritive fluid; which latter is absorbed by the lacteal vessels. Though the duodenum at first sight be similar in structure to the other smaller intestines, yet there is reason to suppose, that the alimentary mass is longer detained in the duodenum than in the jesunum or ilium ; as it is much more capacious, more curved, and provided with a greater number of valvulae conniventes. The assimilation of the alimentary mass within the duode- num is promoted by the addition of the bile and 'pancreatic juice, by which acids, taken in along with our food, or gene- rated by a morbid state of the stomach, are blunted, and pro- bably neutralised. The effect of the acid matter upon the aliment, is thus counteracted ; for, when bile is mixed with any acid, the aci- dity takes off the bitterness of the bile, and the bitterness of the bile takes off the acidity, and may perhaps bring about the separation of the chyme into chyle and excrementitious matter. The bile is probably separated into two parts within the duodenum, viz. into the albuminous part, which flows into the blood along with the chyle, and into another part, which communicates its colour and bitterness to the excrement,-and which serves, at the same time, to stimulate the intestinal canal. On opening the smaller intestines, we meet with a mucous

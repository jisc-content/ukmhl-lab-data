438 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Ulno-Swper-Metacarpeus, or Extensor Carpi Ulnaris. This muscle arises from the external condyle of the os hu- meri, and from the middle of the ulna : its round tendon is inclosed in a sheath in a groove at the back-part of the carpal extremity of the ulna, and is at length fixed into the upper part of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. This muscle extends the wrist, and draws the hand towards the little finger. SECTION XIV. MUSCLES OF THE FINGERS AND THUMB. There are two flexor muscles common to the fingers, and only one extensor. There are two flexors, three extensors, an abductor, an adductor, and an opponens, proper to the thumb. There is an extensor, a flexor, and an adductor of the fore- finger ; and a flexor, an abductor, and an adductor, proper to the little finger. Besides these muscles, there are muscles between the bones of the fingers, called, from their situation, interossei, which move the fingers laterally. Muscles common to the Fingers. Epicondylo-Super-Unguialis, or Extensor Communis Dig â€¢itorum. This muscle, situated upon the posterior surface of the fore-arm, arises from the external condyle of the humerus: the fibres unite, and divide upon the back of the fore-arm into four tendons, which pass under the annular ligament of the wrist in a superficial groove of the radius, and are fixed into the posterior part of all the bones of the fingers. By this muscle the fingers are extended. This muscle covers the extensors of the thumb and fore finger, and also the supinator radii brevis.

392 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Muscles of the Pharynx. Tlie muscles proper to the pharynx are described at the same time as the pharynx. Muscles of the Glottis. In a future part of this work, these muscles will be described along with the cartilages of the larynx, with which they are connected. SECTION II. OF THE TENDINOUS APONEUROSES, AND MUSCLES OF THE PAKIETES OF THE ABDOMEN. / In the fore and lateral parts of the parietes of the abdomen, there are three distinct strata of muscles ; which being sub- servient nearly to the same purpose, I shall describe in the order in which they present upon dissection. Of the Superfcial Fascia. Upon removing, with care, the skin of the belly, a thin fascia, or rather membrane, presents itself', which has been said by some to take its rise only from the inferior part of the tendon of the external oblique muscle, and has been described by Camper. It rarely exhibits a fibrous appearance in the adult; and the fibres, when distinct, pass in a transverse di- rection with respect to the abdomen. These fibres do not re- semble tendinous fibres, being neither to the eye glistening, nor communicating to the touch the same dense feeling as tendon. This membrane is proportionally thicker in the foetus. This fascia, which has always appeared to me to con- sist chiefly of condensed cellular substance, covers the sper- matic cord and round ligament of the uterus, and also some of the inguinal glands of the upper and under cluster ; and may, in some subjects, at the upper part of the thigh, be di- vided into layers, between which some small lymphatic glands are placed. In a few cases, it may be readily traced for sin

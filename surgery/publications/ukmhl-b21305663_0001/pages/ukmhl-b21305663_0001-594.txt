548 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Anatomists are by no means agreed as to the structure of the cellular coat or cellular substance. I am disposed to deny the existence of cells in the cellular substance of any part of the body; and to say that these are artificially formed, by blowing air, or throwing an injection into this peculiar texture; and that during life, this is a soft slimy tenacious substance, the constituent parts of which are disjoined, by the air thrown into it. Villous Coat. The villous coat is connected by a loose band of cellular substance to the muscular coat. It is much more extensive than the other coats, and forms those doublings called Valvulce Conniventes, improperly ; for they do not perform, with accuracy, the office of valves. These doublings are placed transversely in the jejunum, but in the duodenum and ileum they are disposed longitudi- nally : in the ileum they become gradually very small, and almost disappear in the end of it. These valvulm conniventes very rarely extend through the whole circle of the intestine ; often they are joined by commu- nicating folds. These valves are broadest in the middle, and narrower at the extremities. In general they are about a line and a half broad. One edge of these valves is loose, but the other is fixed to the intestine. The valvulae conniventes of different animals vary consider- ably as to form, and in some are awanting. The villous coat i3 a mucous membrane, covered with villi, which vary in length in different animals: after filling the bloodvessels, by a good injection, these villi seem to be made up of a network of bloodvessels, nerves, and orifices of the mucous ducts and lacteal vessels. The coats of the larger intestines are nearly alike to those of the smaller intestines, excepting as to the ligamento-mus- cular bands, which take their origin from the appendix ver- miformis, and have been already noticed. The liquor of the intestines, called Liquor Entericus, is

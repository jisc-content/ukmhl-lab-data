560 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. diameter; in shape it is somewhat like the hoof of the ox, be- ing rounded above, and split into two great lobes, and con- cave below. The upper surface of the liver is not precisely convex; it is contiguous to the diaphragm, and is on the left side slightly impressed by the apex of the heart, to which it is op- posed. The upper and back part of the liver is thick and rounded, where it is fixed by the reflected peritonaeum to the dia- phragm ; and it becomes gradually thinner from right to left, and also towards its fore-part, which has been called its Edge, which, in the right lobe, is directed obliquely downwards, but in the left lobe is nearly horizontal. The inferior surface is not so extensive as the upper convex surface; it is irregularly concave, and inclines a little up- wards and backwards. The upper convex surface of the liver is divided into two great lobes of unequal size, by means of the falciform liga- ment1; and the under concave surface is divided into two parts by the fossa umbilicalis. The right lobe is generally much larger than the left; but there are many exceptions to this, even when the liver is sound ; and disease produces a great change not only in the colour, bulk and texture of the several parts of this organ, but also in the relative proportions of the several component parts. The concave surface of the liver, which rests on the stom- ach and intestines, is very irregular, and is compressed by the contiguous bowels. There, is a remarkable prominence on the under surface of the liver, which inclines downwards, and towards the right side, from its posterior thickened part. The figure of this projection is somewhat like that of the tongue, but it is con- siderably thicker towards its base than its apex. It has been called the third lobe, or Lobule of Sfigelios. This lo- bule rests on the vertebrae, between the vena cava and gul- let; and is placed behind the omentum hepatogastricum.

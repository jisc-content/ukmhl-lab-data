ON THE COLLOCATION OF MUSCLES. 361 w succeeded by relaxation, by which the muscle returns to its former state. Such being the nature of the muscles, it follows, that mo- tion can be produced only by the agency of antagonist mus- cles, of flexor and extensor muscles ; and where balancing of the body is required, the flexions and extensions are accom- modated to the centre of gravity, or vice versa. Such a disposition of the muscles is also conducive to the aspect and symmetry of the body : thus the mouth, for in- stance, is kept in the middle of the face, by the agency of the muscles of its opposite sides balancing each other, as is very evident when the equipoise is destroyed by a palsy of the muscles of one side of the face, for then the mouth is drawn to the opposite side. It is evident that the centre of gravity varies in the differ- ent attitudes of the body ; and hence a number of muscles must be thrown into action to maintain the equilibrium, or there are muscles which modify or limit the action of the flexor and extensor muscles. 3d, The muscles are so disposed as not to interfere with one another. 4th, The action of many muscles accords with their position and form. From the position and form of the muscles an estimate may be formed of their action ; the contraction of muscles be- ing towards their centre, the figure of the muscle is adjusted, and its form modified, so as to produce the necessary motion : thus the long muscles stretched between certain points must draw these towards each other when they contract; a hollow muscle, like the bladder of urine, discharges its contents; and a sphincter muscle, from the circular disposition of its fibres, and its position, is well adapted for a contracted state, sufficient for retention, but which may be overcome when it is necessary. 5th, Many of our movements are accomplished by the com- bined action of several muscles. The movements of many parts of our bodies are the re- sult of the combined action of several muscles; and frequent-

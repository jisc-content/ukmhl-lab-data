448 elements of anatomy. The use of this muscle is to stretch the fascia, and to as- sist in the abduction of the thigh. The tendinous fascia of the sole of the foot, which is very thick and strong, extends between the prominent and anterior pruts ot the os calcis, and to the heads of the metatarsal bones, to which it is fixed by its bifurcated extremities, be- tween which the tendons of the flexor muscles pass : hence is well suited to give protection to the muscles, bloodvessels, and nerves of the sole of the foot. SECTION NVIII. MUSCLES INSERTED INTO THE TROCHANTER MAJOR. The muscles inserted into the trochanter major, move the thigh-bone within the acetabulum, in such a manner as to turn the toes outw'ards, or in the contrary direction. Sacro- Fcmoralis, or Glutaus Maximus. This very thick and strong muscle, which lies under the skin, and constitutes the greater share of the hips, which are proportionally much larger in man than in the inferior ani- mals, takes its origin from the posterior edge of the os ilium, from the lateral surface of the os sacrum, and from the poste- rior part of the sacro-sciatic ligaments. The fibres of the mus- cle are collected into fasciculi, which proceed forwards and downwards, and terminate in a broad and flat tendon, which slides over the trochanter major, and is fixed into the posterior part of the linea aspera of the thigh-bone, below the great trochanter, and into the fascia lata of the thigh. By this muscle, the ball of the os femoris is rotated out- wards. The Hottentot women have a singular projection over the buttocks, which, according to Dr Somerville, consists chiefly of fat, of three or four inches in thickness, w hich is interposed between the skin and muscles; and what is very remarkable,

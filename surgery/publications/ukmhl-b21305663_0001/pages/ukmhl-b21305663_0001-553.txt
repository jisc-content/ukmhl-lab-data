OF THE SALIVA. 507 It had been impossible to reunite the upper and under parts of the gullet, and he continued to feed himself through a bent silver-tube. Hence it may be inferred, that the saliva is not essential to digestion. Besides, pressure made on the parotid gland, tends to lessen the quantity of saliva secreted, and ultimately to stop the secretion of saliva. This led Mr Desault, with the view of removing salivary fistulas, to compress the parotid gland, and, by continuing the pressure and increasing it, the parotid gland was entirely absorbed; none of the saliva passed into the duct, and the fistula was cured. Chemical Analysis of the Saliva. Saliva appears to be a solution, in a large quantity of wa- ter, of albumen, mucus, and certain saline substances, com- pounds of phosphoric and muriatic acids ; with soda, ammo- nia, and lime. The proportions are conjectured by Dr Bos- tock to be about eighty of water, and eight of coagulated al- bumen ; eleven of mucus, and one of saline compounds*. Bekzelius has published the following analysis of the sa- liva. Water, - - 992.9 A peculiar animal matter, - - 2.9 Mucus, - . 1.4 Alkaline muriates, - 1.7 Lactate of soda and animal matter, - 0.9 Pure soda, - 0.2 1000 Mr Biiande discovered, that when saliva is exposed to the galvanic fluid, even after having been first boiled in wa- ter, it gives an abundant coagulation, and a separation of al- kali round the negative pole, though neither acids nor any of the common agents shewed the presence of albumen. Hence this substance may form a part of an animal fluid, and yet be not discoverable by the common tests. „* Vide Murray’s Chemistry, third edition, vol. iv. p. 537.

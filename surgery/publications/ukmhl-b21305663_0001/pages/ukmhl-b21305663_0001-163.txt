In the greatest number of adults it is ossified, and Lipped with a cartilage ; in some one-half of it is cartilaginous, and in others it is all in a cartilaginous state. Several oblique liga- ments are fixed at one end to the cartilages of the ribs,-which connect the sternum firmly to those cartilages*. When the lower end is ossified, and is too much turned outwards, it causes an ulceration of the superincumbent soft part, or if it is turned inwards, it deranges the functions of the stomach -f\ The sternum is joined by cartilages to the seven upper ribs; and the unequal cavity on each side of its upper end is fitted â€¢for the ends of the clavicles. The sternum of the foetus is a mass of cartilage, upon which there are six or seven round pieces of bone ; the uppermost of these is the largest. In some full grown persons a small portion of the breast- bone is not ossified, leaving a cavity into which the point of the finger may be thrust. This bone gives origin and insertion to several muscles; sustains the mediastinum, defends the heart and lungs, at the forepart; and, lastly, by serving as a moveable fulcrum of the ribs, assists considerably in respiration. By the contraction of the intercostal muscles, the ribs must be pulled from the oblique position which their cartilages kept them in, nearer to right angles with the vertebrae and ster- num, because the first or uppermost rib is the most fixed; and the cartilages making a great resistance to raising the an- " Weitbreciit, Syndcsmolog. p. 121. + Rolfisg.

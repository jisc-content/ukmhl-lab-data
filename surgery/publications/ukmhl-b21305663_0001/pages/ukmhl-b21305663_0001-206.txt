ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. I(i0 The second and third are the lateral nasal, which are at each side of the nose, and almost parallel to the first suture. Each of the two lacrymal is almost semicircular, and is placed round the lacrymal groove. The sixth and seventh are the internal orbitar ; each of which is extended obliquely from the middle of the lower side of an orbit to the edge of its base. The two external orbitars are continued, each from the end of the internal orbitar, to the under and fore part of the cheek. The tenth is the mystachial, which reaches only from the lower part of the septum narium, to between the two middle dentes incisores. The longitudinal palate suture stretches from the middle of the foremost teeth through the middle of all the palate. The transverse palate one runs across the palate, nearer the back than the fore part of it. Each of the two palato-maxillary is at the back part of the side of each nostril. The fifteenth is the spinous, which is in the middle of the lower part of the nostrils. This may, perhaps, be rather thought a double schindylesis. The ossa spongiosa are connected to the side of each nos- tril, bv a membrane in young subjects, by a sort of hook, and in adults by a bony union. The indentations of the sutures of the face, (formerly cal- led harmonics), are not so conspicuous as-those of the upper part of the skull; there being less necessity for security against external injuries, or any internal protruding force. These sutures often disappear in old age. From the manner of the conjunction of these bones, they can have no motion, except in common with the cranium. Ossa Nasi. The Ossa Nasi so named from their situation at the root of the nose, are each of an irregular oblong square figure, be- ing broadest at their lower end, narrowest a little higher than

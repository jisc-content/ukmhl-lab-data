BUUS.E OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 445 bercle of the radius is incrusted with cartilage, lined with the membrane of the bursa, and within the bursa there is a pelo- ton of fat. There is a bursa between the tendon of the biceps and the ligament which is common to the radius and ulna. There is a bursa between the olecrafion ulnae and tendon of the triceps extensor cubiti. Bursa of the Inferior Part of the Fore-Arm and Hand. There is a large bursa behind the flexor longus pollicis man us, between it and the fore-part of the radius, and cap- sular ligament of the wrist. A bursa is placed behind the tendons of the flexor digito- rum profundus, on the fore-part of the capsular ligament of the wrist; and, in some subjects, this communicates with the very large bursa, proper to the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus. A bursa is placed between the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis and os trapezium. There is a bursa between a tendon common to the extensor carpi radialis brevis, and extensor digitorum communis. There is a very small bursa between the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and os pisiforme. SECTION XVI. MUSCLES OF THE PELVIS AXD INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. Ix a former part of this work, the peculiarities of the hu- man pelvis, and of the bones of the inferior extremities, which bear an immediate relation to the muscles connected with that part of the skeleton, were described. The largest glutaei muscles, which distinguish man from all the inferior animals, and by which the pelvis is extended on the thighs, and kept in that state in the erect position of the body, and which counter- act the natural tendency of the body to fall forwards, take their rise from the large and expanded wings of the pelvis.

XXXV PREFACE. been deduced from various original sources of infor- mation, which have lately fallen under my own notice. The state of the Lungs of the Foetus has also been described, and as inferences from that, some remarks by Carpuron and Hutchinson, on the natural causes of death after delivery. In treating of the Organs of Urine, I have enume- rated the observations of Berzelius, Majendie, Henry, Rose, Wilson Phillip, and Prout, who have shewn the relations of certain states of the urine, with certain symptoms of disease. The very ample account which has been given of the Organs of Urine and Generation, was the result of a careful examination of the bodies of three criminals. To my assistant Mr Mackenzie, who took very great pains in tracing the course of the muscular fibres of the bladder of urine, I am indebted chiefly for information on that head. As inferences from the descriptive part, remarks have been made on Phy- mosis, Paraphymosis, Castration, Amputation of the Penis; on introducing Instruments into the Urethra ; on the different methods of performing Lithotomy; on Puncturing the Bladder; and on the Dilatation of the Urethra, so as to extract stones from the blad- der. In treating of the Female Organs, I have intro- duced the remarks of Bcehmer and Sir Everard Home, upon the Structure of the Ovaria; the re- marks of Dr Granville upon the same subject; and those of Dr William Hunter and Tiede- mann, upon the Nerves of the Womb; and also re- marks on the displacement of that organ. I have also made mention of the peculiarities of the Female Organs of the Hottentot.

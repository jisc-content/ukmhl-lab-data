OF THE OSSA TEMPORUM. 141 top to bottom, a fissure is observable, into which part of the ligament that secures the articulation of the lower jaw with this bone is fixed. The fore part of the cavity being lined with the same car- tilage which covers the tubercle before it, receives the con- dyle of the jaw ; and in the back part, a small share of the parotid gland and fat is lodged. At the inside of the root of the styloid'apophyse, there is a thimble-like cavity, where the beginning of the internal ju- gular vein, or end of the lateral sinus, is lodged. As the sinuses of the two sides are frequently of unequal size, one of these cavities is as often larger than the other *. Around the external meatus auditorius, there are several small holes for the more firm adhesion of the external cartilage of the ear. There are several holes on the outside of each of these bones. The first is the orifice of a large funnel-like canal, which leads to the organ of healing;; therefore called meatus audi- torius extemus; the form and size of which are very various in different individuals; it is placed between the zygomatic and mastoid processes. The second gives passage to the portio dura of the seventh pair of nerves, and, from its situation between the mastoid and styloid processes, is called foramen stylo-mastoideum. Some way before, and to the inside of the styloid process, there is a canal for the internal carotid artery and the begin- ning of the intercostal nerve. It passes upwards and for- wards. Where this canal is about to make the turn forwards, one, or sometimes two, very small holes go off towards the tympanum ; in these Valsalva-}- affirms, the proper artery, or arteries, of that cavity are lodged. The orifice of the Eustachian tube, which runs outwards and backwards, in a horizontal direction, to the tympanum, may be observed on the anterior surface of this bone. • Hunauld, in Mem. de l’Acad. dea Sciences, 1730.

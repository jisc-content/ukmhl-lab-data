86 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. seum bequeathed to the University by my Father, and of those belonging to my colleague Dr Hamilton, who inform- ed me, that seven of those in his museum belonged to women on whom the Ccesarean operation had been performed. All the deformed pelves were unusually light and soft, with the exception of one; and the most deformed were the most remarkably so, which is sufficient evidence, that the compo- nent bones of the pelvis cannot, like those of the spine, take on an unnatural form, unless when diseased. The distortion is sometimes limited to the upper or under apertures, but generally it is common to both. The rickety pelvis yields under the weight of the body, by which the lumbar vertebrae and the upper part of the os sacrum are bent forwards, or to a side ; after which, the iliac portions of the ossa innominata are bent inwards: those parts of the pelvis opposed to the heads of the thigh bones are pressed upwards and inwards. Hence the symphysis pubis projects beyond the general sweep of the upper aper- ture to the distance of an inch and a half, or two inches: in the specimen most remarkable for deformity, the ace- tabula of the opposite sides had been pressed into immediate contact. The upper aperture of the pelvis had, in the greater num- ber of specimens, somewhat resembled an egg-plumb, laid transversely, and compressed in the middle of one side ; but in the more distorted specimens, the fore and back parts of the upper aperture, to which the pressure is more directly applied, were distant from each other only two inches, or one inch and a half, owing to the projection of the last lumbar vertebra and upper part of the os sacrum, but the distance between the opposite ossa ilia was not much diminished. The depth of the pelvis was also diminished ; for the sacrum had yielded under the weight of the body, and to such an extent, that the upper and under surfaces of it were not distant from each other above two or three inches. The lower end of the deformed sacrum, together with the ossa coccygis, project inwards upon the lower aperture of the pelvis, and diminish the distance between the fourth piece of the os sacrum and symphysis pubis. Owing, also, to the pressure

OF THE UIBS. Ill bv which the ribs are articulated to the bodies of the verte- bra?, gradually increases from the first to the fourth rib, and is diminished after that in each lower rib. The distance of their angles from the heads always increases as they descend to the ninth, on account of the greater breadth of the sacro-lumbalis muscle *. The cartilages of the true ribs become gradually longer as the ribs descend, and are-joined to the breast-bone ; so that being pressed constantly between two bones, they are thicker, harder, and more liable to ossify, than the cartilages of the other ribs. The cartilages of five inferior ribs of each side do not reach to the sternum ; and therefore, wanting the resistance at their fore part, they are pointed. The cartilages of these false ribs are shorter as the ribs descend. To all these five ribs the circular edge of the diaphragm is connected ; and its fibres, instead of being stretched immediately transversely, and so running perpendicular to the ribs are pressed so as to be often, especially in expiration, parallel to the plane in which the ribs lie: Nay, one may judge by the attachments which these fibres have so frequently to the sides of the thorax, a considerable way above where their extremities are inserted into the ribs, and by the situation of the viscera, always to be observed in a dead subject laid supine, that there is constantly a large concavity formed on each side by the diaphragm within these bastard ribs, in which the stomach, liver, spleen, &c. are contained. The cartilages connecting the ribs to the breast-bone have sometimes been separated from it; and sometimes, but more rarely, from the extremities of the ribs, by external violence. My Father discovered, that the cartilages between the ribs and the breast-bone, with the exception of the cartilage of the first rib, are not fixed to the sternum in the same manner as to the ribs ; for the rib which is hollowed receives the car- tilage, and is so firmly united to it, that, in the recent subject, they cannot be separated without lacerating the cartilage ; โข Wixslow, Exposition Anatomique ties Os Secs, ยง G45.

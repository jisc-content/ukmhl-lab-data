592 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY, 83 Adipocire. 12 Bile. 1 Brown matter. 4 Water. 100 No. 7.—The form of this concretion was an irregular po- lygon ; and it was about the size of a filbert. Its external surface had a marbled appearance, from zones and spots of black, on a white ground, but, in other respects, it was simi- lar to the preceding; internally it was composed of black and white layers, or of an admixture of black and white coloured matter; the former were very thin, not above a line thick ; and the latter, which greatly predominated, was slightly ra- diated. Its specific gravity vras found to be 1133; and 100 parts appeared to consist of 75 Adipocire. 15 Bile. 4 Brown matter. 6 Water. 100 No. 8.—These small calculi approached in form to the cube. Their colour was of a dull brown; they were of a greasy feel, and waxy lustre; were compact and brittle, and not at all of a laminated structure. All that wrere divided exhibited small black nuclei. They were of specific gravity 1050. 100 parts consisted of 70 Adipocire. 3 Brown matter. 27 Bile and Water. 100 No. 9-*—-This was the fragment of a calculus. Its exter- nal surface was rough, and of a dark brown colour: in- ternally it w’as of a white pearly appearance, and foliated tex- ture. It readily sunk in water. The quantity was too small

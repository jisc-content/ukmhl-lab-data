406 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMV. has an oblique direction, for it passes directly through the parictes of the abdomen. 13th, That as there is fat around the Under Abdominal, and also at the Crural Apertures, if there be an unusual quantity of it in such a situation, it may bear a strong resem- blance to a hernia; and should colic, constipation and vomit- ing, follow, the case may be supposed to be a strangulated hernia. 14th, That, on account of the connection of the crural arch with the neighbouring fasciae, when we wish to relax as far as possible the superficial fascia, and the inguinal canal, to take off the pressure and stricture upon the displaced intestine, it is necessary to raise the head and pelvis of the patient (who is supposed to be in bed) with pillows, to bend the thighs very considerably, and to throw the knee of the affected side over to the opposite side, leaving only sufficient space for the surgeon to introduce his hand. On attempting to reduce such hernias, the pressure should be made in the same direc- tion as the hernial tumour, that is, in a recent inguinal hernia, the pressure should be made in the direction of the anterior spinous process of the os ilium; and in a hernia of some du- ration, directly upwards, as the Upper and Under Parts of the Inguinal Canal are, in such a case, nearly opposite to each other. 15th, That unless the truss shall make pressure, not only upon the Under, but also upon the Upper Abdominal Aper- ture, the inguinal hernia will not be removed ; and that a truss which presses only upon the Under Aperture, instead of af- fording relief, exposes the patient to strangulation at the Up- per Abdominal Aperture, or between the Upper and Under Abdominal Apertures *. â€¢ In justice to my Father, I cannot forbear from describing a Truss for an Inguinal Hernia, which he directed to be made many years ago, and which se- veral of his patients have worn with much benefit. The cushion of the common truss is so small as to cover one of the Apertures only, and, from its thinness, when the circular is tightened, with the view of in- creasing the pressure on the Aperture, the pad is raised forwards from the A per-

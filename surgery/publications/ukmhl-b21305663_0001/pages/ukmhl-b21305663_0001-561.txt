SECTION II. OF THE HUMAN STOMACH. The bowels of the abdomen being very moveable, are liable to change of place, from the pressure of the atmospherical air, and from the condensation of the air included within the stomach and intestines; hence in the greater number of en- gravings, the bowels of the abdomen are represented too low down, and not situated as during life. Some years ago, a very favourable opportunity presented it- self to me for examining the bowels of the abdomen immediate- ly after death ; and, in subjects in the full vigour of health, the cause of whose death could have occasioned little injury to the organic structure. 1 therefore availed myself of so favour- able an opportunity, and soon afterwards published engravings of these parts; which had the additional recommendation of exhibiting what may be called the natural structure, and consequently of being a more exact type of nature than usual- ly occurs. Every part of the alimentary canal, in the higher orders of animals, is not equally capacious. The term Stomach or Sto- machs has been applied to the most capacious portion or por- tions of this tube; but, in insects, no such distinction is mark- ed, as to the different parts of the alimentary tube. Within the stomach, what authors have called Cliymosis, takes place, or that process by which dead animal or vegeta- ble matter is, to a certain extent, rendered fit for the nutrition of a living animal. No animal of the higher classes can exist, for a long time, without a stomach as an internal receptacle for its food *. * About 25 years ago, I thought I had discovered an exception to the above K k 2

PREFACE. XXV This mode of subdividing the subject is useful to more advanced Students; but not to the beginner, for whose use I profess to write. The young Student re- quires an Elementary Book,â€”which shall embrace all these departments of Anatomy, which shall give ge- neral, as well as particular views, and which shall sug- gest to him some of those inferences which are appli- cable to Physiology, and to the practice of Surgery. If he be a Student who studies Anatomy as a branch of Natural Philosophy, who wishes to get a view of the Animal Creation, which affords such striking illustra- tions of the wisdom and power of its Author, it is re- quisite that that grand plan upon which animals are constructed, and also those deviations which a peculiar economy renders indispensable, should be laid before him by an appeal to the Anatomy of the inferior ani- mals, and by comparing it with that of Man. What can be more uninteresting than purely Descriptive Anatomy, and what more apt to disgust, rather than to encourage, the young Student in the further prose- cution of that most important study ? If, on the other hand, the Student wishes to ac- quire such a knowledge of Anatomy, as is requisite for the Physician, the Surgeon, or the Accoucheur, it is of much moment to point out to him the intimate re- lation between those sister sciences, which have been reared upon the basis of Anatomy; and to shew that, to neglect Anatomy, is to neglect laying a solid founda- tion-stone, and is like building a house upon the sand. In each department, after having premised a few general observations, a more detailed account is given, interspersed with such observations upon the Anato- my of the Inferior Animals, as are calculated to throw light on the Structure or Functions of the human

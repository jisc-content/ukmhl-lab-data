OF THE SCAPULA. 243 a little transversely, or across each other; and thus the risk of dislocation is averted, which would have been still more frequent, if either of the bones had moved on the other per- pendicularly up and down, without any rotation. Sometimes a moveable ligamentous cartilage is found in this joint; in other cases, a cartilage is only interposed at the anterior half of it; and, in some old subjects, a sesamoid bone has been found here*. The scapula is connected to the head, os hyokles, vertebra, ribs, and arm-bone, by muscles, that have one end fastened to these bones, and the other to the scapula, by which it may be moved upwards, downwards, backwards, or for- wards. By the quick succession of these motions, its whole body is carried in a circle. But being also often moved, as upon an axis, perpendicular to its plane, its circumference turns in a circle, whose centre this axis is -f*. In these diffe- rent movements, the outer end of the clavicle and the arm are carried along with it. The glenoid cavity of this bone re- ceives the os humeri, which plays in it as a ball in a socket. The scapula serves as a fulcrum to the arm ; and, by alter- ing its position on different occasions, presents to the head of the os humeri a fit socket to move in, and thereby ex- extends the sphere of motion of the superior extremity, and increases the sphere of action of the muscles which rise from it, by altering their directions, in respect to the bone which they are to move. The scapula also serves to defend the back-part of the thorax. The base, acromion, coracoid process, and head of the scapula, are cartilaginous at birth; and the three first are joined as epiphyses; while the head, with the glenoid cavity, is not formed into a distinct separate bone.

546 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Of the Coats of the Smaller Intestines. The intestines have four coats, a Peritoneal, Muscular, Cellular, and Villous coat. It is still undetermined, whether the intestines have a cuti- cular lining or not. I have often looked for it with great care, both in the human body, and in the inferior animals. It is possible it may, on account of its extreme thinness, have elud- ed my research. Morbid anatomy presents a strong argu- ment in favour of the existence of such a cuticular lining. The different textures of the body are liable to peculiar orga- nic derangements. Warts have been enumerated amongst the organic derangements of the cuticle; and, in the camp dysentery, it is not uncommon to find a portion of the villous coat of the intestines covered with a great number of small brown warts. Peritoneal Coat. The outer coat is derived from the peritonaeum. Its ex- ternal surface is quite smooth, and lubricated, like other se- rous membranes, by a thin serous fluid. This coat possesses considerable toughness and elasticity, and serves to strengthen the intestines. Muscular Coat. The second coat is composed of muscular fibres, disposed in a longitudinal and circular manner. The former are very thin and pale, and visible only on the convex surface of the intestine; whereas the latter, or the cir- cular fibres, are much coarser, and more apparent, especially in the duodenum ; but they are not so obvious in the jejunum and ileum. Upon examining minutely each circular fibre,, it may be observed to be made up of several distinct segments of circles. The above description applies to the greater share of the intestinal canal, but in the intestinum rectum, or rather cur- vum, the stratum of longitudinal muscular fibres is very ob- vious, the fibres being thick and strong.

SECTION XXI. MUSCLES OF THE ANKLE OR TARSUS, AND OF THE META- TARSUS. The muscles which move the foot, may be divided into three classes; viz. 1. Those which bend the foot. 2. Those which extend the foot by the medium of the tendo Achillis, and are the principal agents in walking, running, dancing, &c. 3. Those which lift the foot to either side. The flexion of the foot with respect to the leg, or of the leg with respect to the foot, is accomplished by two muscles. Tibio-super-Tarseus, or Tibialis Anticus. This muscle lies under the tendinous fascia of the leg, on the fibular side of the spine of the tibia : it arises from the fore-part of the tibia, and from the interosseous ligament: its tendon passes below the annular ligament of the ankle- joint over the astragalus and os naviculare, and is fixed into the os cuneiforme internum and metatarsal bone of the great toe, by a tendon, the insertion of which is concealed by the abductor flexor brevis of the great toe. Tibio-sub-Tarseus, or Tibialis Posticus. This muscle, which is covered at its lower part by the flexor longus digitorum pedis, and by the flexor longus polli- cis pedis, takes its origin from the posterior surface of the ti- bia, fibula, and interosseous ligament; and its fibres are dis- posed oblicjuely in respect to a middle tendon, which passes

420 elements of anatomy. and sacro-lumbalis on the same side as the lower shoulder, are large and prominent, but those on the opposite side are less distinct than usual; and, instead of being convex, are ra- ther somewhat depressed. The muscles of the back are very indistinct in women who have worn stays for some time. Transversalis Colli. This muscle lies on the inner side of the longissimus dorsi: it arises from the transverse processes of the six uppermost dorsal vertebrae, and is fixed into all the transverse processes of the vertebrae of the neck, except the first and last: it pulls the neck backwards and sidewise. Cervicalis descendens. This muscle forms a part of the sacro-spinalis, and is fixed to the transverse processes of the 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebrae, by three distinct tendons. It assists in turning the neck obliquely backward. Spinalis Dorsi. This muscle is placed between the spine and longissimus dorsi, from which it cannot be divided without cutting some of the muscular fibres. It arises from the spinous processes of the two upper lumbar, and three lower dorsal vertebrae, and is fixed by tendons into the spinous processes of the 2d, 3d, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th dorsal vertebrae. This muscle is also an extensor, and serves to fix the verte- brae to each other. Trarnsverso-Spinalis Colli or Semi-Spinalis Colli. This muscle, which arises from the transverse processes of the seven superior dorsal vertebrae, and is connected to the spinous processes of the 2d, 3d, 4th and 5th cervical vertebrae, extends the neck backwards, and pulls it to a side. Transverso-Spinalis Dorsi, or Semi-Spinalis Dorsi. This muscle is placed nearer to the spine than the lower part of the preceding muscle.

OF THE CRURAL SHEATH. 899 nearly a right angle with the body, the internal edge of the crural arch is thrown into a state of relaxation ; which posi- tion is favourable, not only to the displacement of the bowels* but also to the replacing the bowels when protruded. A con- tinued tendinous membrane lines the internal parts for the in- ternal or'posterior margin of the crural arch is intimately inter- woven with the tendinous fascia which covers the iliacus inter- nus and psoas magnus muscles, which is connected to the crista of the ilium, to the linea ilio-pectinea and ligament of the pubes; also with that fascia, or ratner membrane, which covers the transverse muscles, as far as that part of the thigh where the anterior iliac artery and vein emerge from the pelvis: Thus, the crural arch is firmly bound down, and the bowels can be protruded only through the crural aperture. Of the Crural Sheath. A part of the iliac fascia passes behind the crural vessels, and is firmly united to the pubal part of the fascia lata, form- ing the posterior part of the crural sheath ; and the crural vessels are covered anteriorly by the fascia transversalis, cru- ral arch, and cellular substance. Thus, the beginning of the crural sheadi is formed, and the above fasciae unite at the sides, and form the lateral portions of the sheath. The anterior iliac artery and vein are closely enveloped by the same kind of cellular sheath as the other arteries and veins of the body ; which sheath is firmly fixed to the inner edge of the crural arch by short cellular threads; and between the artery and vein there is a distinct division. Of the Crural Aperture. On the side of the anterior iliac vein, next the pubes, there is an aperture called Crural, somewhat of an oval figure, and considerably larger in the female than in the male, which is generally filled by a cribriform membrane, through which the lymphatics of the inferior extremities enter the pelvis, and sometimes, though very rarely, by a membrane, which has somewhat of a ligamentous nature, and sometimes by lympha-

LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBHJE. 327 There is also an internal lateral ligament extending between the posterior maxillary foramen of the under-jaw, and the pe- trous portion of the temporal bone. Within this joint, there is an inter-articular cartilage, which is thinner in the centre than in the circumference; and to the edge of this the capsular ligament is fixed. The skull is fixed to the cervical vertebrae, by a general capsular ligament, which surrounds the condyles. There is a perpendicular ligament extending between the occipital bone, and upper part of the tooth-like process of the second cervical vertebra. There are also two ligaments, one from each side of the tooth- iike process, which have been named lateral ligaments, and which are inserted into the occipital bone before the condyles. There is also a circular ligament arising from the edge of the foramen spinale, which is inserted into the edge of the foramen magnum. Ligaments of the Vertebra. The tendons between the spinous and transverse processes â€¢of the vertebrae, serve the purpose of ligaments, and have been named from their situations. A strong ligament, with fibres which follow a longitudinal direction, runs along the fore-parts of the vertebrae. This ligament becomes broader the nearer it approaches the os sacrum, and serves to bind together and to defend the vertebrae. The above ligament is formed by a number of shorter in- tervertebral ligamentous fibres. The theca vertebralis is also lined by a ligament; it ex- tends from the foramen magnum ossis occipitis, to the os sa- crum. There is an elastic yellow ligament passing between the spi- nous processes of the neck, which corresponding ligament is remarkably strong in the elephant, and in some birds, and tends by its elasticity to save muscular power. There are ligaments which are peculiar to the atlas, and to the last lumbar vertebra.

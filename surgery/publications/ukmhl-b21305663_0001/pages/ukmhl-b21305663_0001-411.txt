365 OF THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES. It merits mention, also, that the loss of power arising from the position of the muscles, and manner in which their ten- dons are fixed into the bones, is in a degree counterbalanced by the multiplication of the fibres of the muscles, by the increas- ed diameter of the extremities of the bones, and by the in- troduction of moveable bones, as the patella and sesamoid bones, which alter the direction of the muscles, and increase their power. The strength of muscles is also much lessened by the in- fluence of passions of the mind, as that of fear, which un- nerves the strongest arm. Of Oblique Muscles. There are many important advantages gained by the oblique course of the fibres of the muscles, which are fully explained in the subjoined pages on that subject, which I have ex- tracted from my Fatherâ€™s Essay on the Oblique Muscles f. Of the Varied Direction of the Fibres of our Muscles, and of the Effect of this upon our Motions. I. In many of our muscles, the fleshy fibres, instead of run- ning in straight lines, or in lines nearly such, between their origins and insertions, are placed in oblique directions. Before I attempt to explain the effects of the direction of the fleshy fibres, I shall describe the varieties of this in the different muscles of the human body. 1. In some muscles, as in the recti of the abdomen, the sar- torius, the gracilis, &c. the fibres are directed, from the ori- gins of the muscles to their insertions, in nearly parallel lines; and these may be called straight muscles. 2. In others, the muscle is of a triangular shape, and its fibres resemble the spokes of a wheel, or the sticks of a spread fan ; and such muscles may be called radiated. The fibres, in some of them diverge from the origin or fixed point, as is the case in the levator palpebrm supcrioris; and in others, as Edin. Phil. Trans, vol. iii.

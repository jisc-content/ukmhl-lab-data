ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 10‘2 In the nasal bones there are few cells ; they are firm and solid. They are joined above to the frontal bone, by the middle oi the transverse suture; behind, to the maxillary bones, by the lateral nasal sutures ; below, to the cartilages of the nose; before, to one another, by the anterior nasal suture; internal- ly, to the septum narium. These bones serve to cover and defend the root of the nose. In an infant, the nasal bones are proportionally shorter and thinner at their upper part, than in an adult, and porous on the internal surface. Fractures of the ossa nasi are not so frequent as might have been expected from their exposed situation. Generally both bones are broken; there are, however, instances in which the fracture has been limited to one of them. A fracture of one or both of the bones of the nose is ge- nerally accompanied by a fracture of the nasal plate of the ethmoidal bone; and consequently, by considerable bleeding, inflammation and swelling of the softer parts of the nose : and I have seen instances in which the crista galli had been beaten upwards ihto the substance of the brain. Though the broken pieces of these bones are not apt to be disunited by the action of muscles, they are apt to be disunited by fal- ling inwards, which has led to a proposal of putting into the nostrils dossils of lint, besmeared with hog’s-lard, which, how- ever, are but of little use. Ossa Unguis. The Ossa Unguis, or lacrymalia, are so named, from their resemblance in figure and magnitude to the nail ot the finger, and because the tears pass upon them into the nose. Their external surface is composed of two smooth concavi- ties and a middle ridge. The depression behind forms a small share of the orbit, and the one before is a deep perpen- dicular canal, or fossa, larger above than below, containing part of the lacrymal sac and duct. This part ought to be

132 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The two tables of the frontal bone are disunited at the fore and under part of that bone, and the intervening space or spaces have been called the Frontal Sinuses. The situation of these frontal sinuses is much more marked in some than in other skulls, and generally it is more ap- parent in the forehead of the male ; and, according to com- mon observation, tbe size of the frontal sinuses bears a ratio to the age of the individual,—a position which is however not confirmed by the skulls in my possession, as the frontal sinuses are equally capacious in several skulls containing all the teeth, as in others where the teeth and alveolar processes are totally awanting. In some European skulls in my museum, the risings in the frontal bone over the frontal sinuses, bear a very exact re- semblance to a couple of chemical retorts, the larger or bulb- ous parts of which are distant from each other about an eighth of an inch, and with their smaller extremities directed out- wards, and in contrary directions: but, in a few instances, there is no intervening flat space externally between the si- nuses. There is also the utmost variety as to the size of the fron- tal sinuses in different nations. In the Negro and Carib skulls, they are small and flat; but, on the other hand, they are remarkably large in the skull of a Frenchman, who was only twenty-three years of age; in three skulls of natives of New South Wales; in two skulls that were brought from Van Dieman’s Land, and in a skull found in the Catacombs at Paris. The frontal sinuses are also very conspicuous in the skull of a Norwegian in my possession, owing Hto the sudden manner in which the frontal bone immediately over the sinuses in- clines backwards. But it is not always possible to judge of the extent of the sinuses, by an examination of the outer sur- face of the skull; for in some specimens, I found the depth to be much greater than in others, so that when the sinus vas opened, it extended across the upper part of the orbit, and on each side of the ethmoid bone, and reached as far back as the sphenoid bone.

PREFACE. XXV111 dern improvements in Anatomy, Physiology, and Sur- gery, contained in many very expensive books, in Transactions of Learned Societies, and in some Pe- riodical Journals, to which few Students have access. Descriptions in language, however carefully drawn up, being inadequate to convey distinct impressions on many points of anatomy, it seemed necessary to il- lustrate the text by several Engravings. I have not given, excepting in one instance, en- gravings representing relative situation; for in an oc- tavo book, such representations must necessarily have been so diminutive as to have conveyed little informa- tion as to the subjects depicted. Having stated so much regarding the general scope of my work, it may not be improper to subjoin a brief sketch of its several component parts, and of those ad- ditions or improvements most worthy of the attention of the reader. Part I. is dedicated to general observations re- specting the animal frame, and to the examination of its component, solid and fluid parts. On the construction of the skeleton much has been added of my own, and also from the Lectures of Sir E. Home and of Cuvier ; and on the proportions of its several component parts, from Leonardo da Vinci, Scemmering, and Sir Anthony Carlyle. Dr John Davy was so polite as to repeat many of his experiments on the chemical analysis of the bones, to add to the valuable table, of which I pub- lished the original in my Outlines. A part of the description of the particular bones has been derived from my Grandfatherâ€™s Osteology; which, though published nearly 100 years ago, still

The Maxillo-Labialis Inferior, or the Depressor Anguli Oris. This flat and triangular shaped muscle, which is very va- rious in point of size, in different individuals, arises from the side of the under jaw; crosses the lower part of the De- pressor Labii Inferioris, and, becoming narrower as it ascends, unites in the corner of the mouth with the Zygomatic and Le- vator Anguli Oris. It depresses the corner of the mouth, as in crying. The Mento-Labialis, or Depressor Labii Inferioris. This muscle arises from the anterior, but chiefly from the lateral, part of the under jaw. The fibres of this muscle pass obliquely upwards and in- wards, till it joins its fellow in the middle of the lip; and is fixed by a broad plate of muscular fibres into the under lip. This muscle opens the mouth, by depressing the under lip. Levator Menti, or Levator Labii Inferioris, Arises from the alveolar processes of the incisor and canine teeth of the lower jaw, and terminates in the under lip and skin of the chin. The use of this muscle is to raise the under lip when it has been depressed; and it also corrugates the chin, and turns outwards the lip. Depressor Labii Superioris et Alee Nasi. This small muscle arises from the alveolar processes of the incisor and canine teeth of the upper jaw; and it is fixed into the upper lip and root of the wing of the nose. This muscle draws the upper lip downwards. Bucco-Labialis, or Buccinator. This thin and quadrangular portion of flesh covers the mu- VOL. i. b b

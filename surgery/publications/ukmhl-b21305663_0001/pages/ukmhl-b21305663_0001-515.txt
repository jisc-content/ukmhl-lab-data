469 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. . CHAP, t GENERAL OBSERVATIONS UPON THE STRUCTURE AND FUNC- TIONS OF THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION. B\ Digestion, is understood that process by which the food received into the system undergoes the alteration neces- sary for repairing the waste., and sustaining the strength of the animal, during the exercise of its several functions. To support the strength of the body, animals are provided with digestive organs ; and are at the same time stimulated, by the sensations of hunger and thirst, to take in the proper supply of aliment. The food is separated into its useful and useless parts with- in the stomach and intestines; and the nutritious part, called Chyle, is absorbed by small vessels, which, from the colour of the fluid they contain, have been called Lacteal. It is the office of these vessels to convey the lacteal fluid to be mixed with the blood; and during the passage of the blood through the lungs, the chyle and blood are intimately incor- porated with each other; or at the lungs, the process of di- gestion is completed. In considering the nature of digestion, it is necessary to ex- amine, 1. The preparation which the food undergoes before it enters the stomach. . 2. The changes it undergoes in the stomach and intestines. 3. The separation of the nutritious and excrementitious parts; and the effect of the addition of the bile and pancreatic liquor to the alimentary mass. 4. The mode of conveyance of the nutrition or chyle into the blood. 5. 1 he changes which it undergoes after its mixture with the general circulating fluid.

67 OF Tim VERTEBRA. Of the Peculiarities of the Cervical Vertebra. First Vertebra or Atlas. The first, which, from its use of supporting the head, has the name of Atlas *, has no body ; but, instead of it, there is a bony arch : In the convex fore-part of which, is a small rising, for the insertion of the musculi longi colli; and, on each side of this protuberance, a small cavity may be observed, where the recti intend minores take their rise. The upper and lower parts of the arch are rough and un- equal, where the ligaments that connect this vertebra to the os occipitis, and to the second vertebra, are fixed. The back part of the arch is concave, smooth, and covered with a carti- lage, in a recent subject, to receive the tooth-like process of the second vertebra. On each side of the spinal canal, there is a small rough sinuosity, to which the ligaments going to the sides of the tooth-like process of the following vertebra are fixed ; and on each side, a small rough protuberance and de- pression is observable, for the transverse ligament, which se- cures the tooth-like process in the sinuosity. Instead of the spinal process, there is a large bony arch, lest the muscles which pass over this vertebra at that place should be hurt in extending the head. On the back and upper part of this arch there are two de- pressions for the origin of the recti postici minores ; and at the lower part are two other sinuosities, into which the liga- ments which connect this bone to the following one are fixed. The superior oblique processes of the atlas are large, ob- long, hollow, and more horizontal than in any other vertebra, â€¢and are nicely fitted to the condyloid processes of the os oc- cipitis. Under the external edge of each of these oblique processes, there is the fossa, or deep open channel, in which the verte- bral arteries make the circular turn, as they are about to en- ter the great foramen of the occipital bone, and where the E 2

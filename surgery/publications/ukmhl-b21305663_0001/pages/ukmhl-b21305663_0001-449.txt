ABDOMINAL MUSCLES.â€”INFERENCES. 403 be not ruptured, it forms the hernial sac, as it must be push- ed forwards before the bowels which have been displaced. 4th, As the parietes of the abdomen do not give the same degree of support to their contents where the spermatic cord, round ligament of the uterus, and the crural bloodvessels, pass outwards, the bowels are protruded at such places, and the frequency of the protrusion bears a ratio to the size and direc- tion of the aperture in the parietes of the abdomen. From the greater size of the inguinal canal of the male, men are more frequently afflicted by inguinal herniae ; and this disease is more dangerous to women, there being, on account of the smaller diameter of the inguinal canal, a greater risk of strangulation. 5th, That the spermatic cord and round ligament of the uterus, which are imbedded within the inguinal canal, cannot be compressed during the action of the abdominal muscles, owing chiefly to the peculiar manner in which the under tendi- nous column of the external oblique muscle is folded beneath the spermatic cord, and fixed to the linea ilio-pectinea. 6th, That the oblique course of the spermatic cord and round ligament of the adult, proves a great barrier to the pro- trusion of the contents of the abdomen and pelvis, as it serves in some measure the office of a valve, but as the upper aper- ture is immediately opposite to the under aperture in an in- fant, infants are much more exposed to the hernia at the groin than adults. 7th, As the space of about an inch intervenes between the upper and under abdominal apertures, the intestines may not always pass through the under inguinal aperture, but may be arrested in their course downwards between the upper and under apertures ; and in these circumstances, the tumour is not external to the parietes of the abdomen, and but of small size, the inguinal canal not admitting of much extension. 8th, That the phrase Stricture at the Under Abdominal Aperture, which has been employed even by the most cele- brated surgeons, may convey an incorrect idea of the cause of the strangulation in cases of herniae; for it implies, that the spasmodic contraction of the tendinous bands of the exter- nal oblique muscles occasions the strangulation. c c 2

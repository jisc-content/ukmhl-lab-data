OF THE OS CTJNEIFORME. On the outside of this cavity is another smooth, narrow, ob- ong groove, for receiving the upper end of the os unciforme ; on the outside of which, a small round convexity is found, for its connexion with the os cuneiforme. Between the great convexity above, and the first deep inferior cavity, there is a rough fossa, to which the circular ligament of the joint of the wrist is fixed. Of the Os Cuneiforme. The Os CuneiformÂ® is broader above, and towards the back of the hand, than it is below and forwards. The supe- rior slightly convex surface is included in the joint of the wrist, being opposed to the lower end of the ulna. Below this the cuneiform bone has a rough fossa, wherein the liga- ment of the articulation of the wrist is fixed. On the internal side of this bone, where it is contiguous to the os lunare, it is smooth and slightly concave. Its lower surface, where it is contiguous to the os unci- forme, is oblong, and concave. Near to the middle of its anterior surface a circular plane appears, for the attachment of the os pisiforme. Of the Os Pisiforme. The Os Pisiforme is almost spherical, except one cir- cular plane, or slightly hollow surface, which is covered with cartilage, from which its whole rough body projects into the palm; having the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and a ligament from the styloid process of the ulna, fixed to its upper part ; and the transverse ligament of the wrist, to its internal side : ligaments, extended to the unciforme bone, and to the os metacarpi of the little finger, are attached to its lower part: the abductor minimi digiti has its origin from its fore-part; and, at the internal side of it, a small de- pression is formed, for the passage of the ulnar nerve. Of the Os Trapezium. The Os Trapezium has four unequal sides and angles in its voi,. i. K

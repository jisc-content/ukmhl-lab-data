ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 20 we should not have had in standing erect, if the bearing of all the bones to each other had been perpendicular; but this is more than compensated by the advantages above men- tioned. 9th, The disposition of the bones, and their form, have a reference to the function of the part with which they are con- nected. Hence the Brain and Spinal Marrow, which are very important organs, of a delicate fabric, and are injured by pressure, are contained within a bony case.—The form of the teeth and jaws, indicates the kind of food on which the ani- mal subsists.—The senses of smell, hearing, tasting, and see- ing, are much improved by the peculiar form of the bones.— The Ribs protect the organs they inclose; and their oblique position in respect to the spine, has a reference to the enlarge- ment of the chest, during inspiration; for when the ribs are brought to a right angle with the spine, the breast-bone is pushed forwards, and the distance between the fore and back part of the chest is increased.—The Cartilages connecting the ribs to thg breast-bone, being twisted during inspiration, by their elastic reaction, tend to pull down the ribs; and the breadth of the ribs protects the contents of the chest, for there is no move space between the ribs than is sufficient for lodging the muscles which raise them.—The Pelvis is of such a shape as to contain and defend many important parts, and is so formed before, that the adjacent muscles act upon the hollow bowels included within it. \0th, Broad bones are placed where defence is necessary, or where considerable space is required for the attachment of powerful muscles ;—long bones where extensive motion is performed ;—and short bones, where it is requisite to unite a certain degree of firmness with mobility. Lastly, in some animals the skeleton forms a part of the or- gans of apprehension, as in the Lobster, Crab, &c.

OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS. 503 wife compared them to those of an eel in a similar condition, quite in the way that Ovid has compared them to the motions of the tail of a mutilated snake. “ To these observations made upon animals, I may add here a similar one made upon the human tongue itself, the knowledge of which I owe to my excellent friend and much respected colleague, Reimar SECTION VI. OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS. These are very numerous, and have been divided into two •classes, viz. into the large and small. The larger salivary glands are, the parotid, the submaxillary, and sublingual glands; and are so placed as to be compressed during man- ducation. The parotid gland occupies the space between the meatus auditorius externus, mastoid process, and the angle of the lower jaw; and, stretching across the face, in part covers the masseter muscle, becoming much thinner in its substance; and it sends down a process which is in contact with the in- ferior maxillary gland. The form of this gland is oval; and somewhat flattened before and behind, and lengthened out from above downwards. The parotid gland is covered by the •skin, and by some fibres of the platysma myoides, and by a white membrane, which envelops the substance of the gland ; and the external carotid artery passes through the s'ubstance of the gland, dividing, within it, into three branches; hence the danger of cutting out a portion of this gland. The pa- rotid gland is firmly attached to the neighbouring parts; it is fixed above to the capsular ligament of the under jaw, and to the ascending branch of the under jaw. Behind, we find the mastoid process; 'and the sterno-cleido- mastoid muscle, which covers the posterior part of the gland; a litle deeper, the digastric muscle ; and, under it, the exter- nal carotid artery. This gland, in the adult, is of a white colour, inclining to • Edin. Phil. Journ. vol. viii. p. 263.

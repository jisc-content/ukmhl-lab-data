OF THE LIGAMENTS AND BURSAS MUCOSAS. 313 COMPARISON BETWEEN THE STRUCTURE OF THE CAPSULA& LIGAMENTS OF THE JOINTS AND BURS.E, AND OF THE AP- PARATUS BY WHICH THE SYNOVIA OF THE JOINT IS SE- CRETED. Before proceeding to describe the particular ligaments, it seems necessary to institute a comparison between the struc- ture of the capsular ligaments of the joints and bursae muco- sae, and to describe the synovial apparatus, and also the na- ture of that fluid. There is a striking resemblance between the structure of the capsular ligaments and bursae. 1. The internal membrane of the ligaments of the joints, like that of the bursae, is thin and dense. 2. It is connected to the external ligaments by the common cellular substance. 3. Between it and the bones, layers of cartilage, or the arti- cular cartilages, are interposed. 4. At the sides of the joint, where it is not subjected to violent pressure and friction, the adipose substance is connect- ed with the cellular membrane. 5. Within the cavities of the joints we observe masses of fat projecting, covered with similar bloodvessels, and with similar fimbriae or fringes hanging from the edges. 6. In the knee we may observe the upper part of such a mass of fat, forming what has been called the mucilaginous gland of the joint; and the under part of it projecting into the bursa, behind the ligament which ties the patella to the tibia. 7. The liquor which lubricates the bursae has the same co- lour, consistence, and properties, as that of the joints ; and both, as I have found by experiment, are affected in the same manner by heat, mineral acids, and ardent spirits. Immediately after an ox was killed, I opened the joints and large bursae of the legs, and collected the liquors they contained. These were similar to each other in colour, smell,

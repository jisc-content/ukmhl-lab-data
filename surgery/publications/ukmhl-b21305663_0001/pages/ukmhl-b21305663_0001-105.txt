OF THE VERTEBRiE. 59 By means of these substances, the body is put as it were upon a series of springs, which tend to lessen or avert the bad effects of violent shocks. The bodies of the uppermost vertebrae are smaller and more solid; but the inferior are larger and more spongy, and the cartilages between them are thick, and the surrounding ligaments strong, in proportion to the largeness of the vertebrae, and to the quantity of motion they perform ; thus the greater weight is supported on the broadest base, whereas there is a greater degree of movement, towards the middle of our body. Processes.â€”From each side of the body of each vertebrae, a bony bridge is produced backwards, and to a side ; from the posterior end of which, a slanting process rises, and ano- ther descends. The smooth, and what is generally the flat- est side of each of these four processes, which are called the oblique (Articulatorii minimi), is covered with a smooth carti- lage ; and the two lower ones of each vertebrae are fitted to, and articulated with, the two upper or ascending oblique pro- cesses of the vertebrae below, having their articular ligaments fixed into the rough line round their edges. From between the oblique processes of each side, the verte- brae is stretched out laterally, into a process that is named Transverse. From the back part of the roots of the two oblique, and of the transverse processes of each side, a broad oblique bony plate is extended backwards; and where these meet, the spi- nous process of the vertebrae takes it rise, which projects back- wards. The substance of the processes is considerably stronger and firmer, and has a thicker external plate, than the bodies of the vertebrae. Of the Vertebral Canal. The vertebrae, when united, form a smooth uninterrupted canal for the spinal chord, which has been called the Spinal or Vertebral Canal. The component pieces of this canal are

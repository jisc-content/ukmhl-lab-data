398 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. long the brim of the pelvis, over the surface of the iliacus internus muscle; and, upon reaching the upper abdominal aperture, the vas deferens is added. The spermatic cord, thus formed, then passes obliquely downwards and forwards, along the lower part of the internal oblique and transverse mus- cles of the abdomen in its course, receiving from the internal oblique the cremaster muscle; and then, at the under abdomi- nal aperture, it suddenly forms an angle, which covers the in- sertion of the outer tendinous column of the external oblique muscles into the pubes, and then passes directly into the scro- tum. This peculiar course of the spermatic cord has been very faithfully represented by Vesalius, in the wooden plates af- fixed to his book, and also by Albinus. It was reserved for Sir Astley Cooper, to detect and describe the upper ab- dominal aperture, which may be perceived by introducing the finger into the under abdominal aperture, and, by pushing it upwards in the direction of the anterior spinous process of the ilium, the borders of the upper aparture may then be perceived about an inch nearer to the anterior spinous process of the os ilium than the under aperture, the borders of which are in part formed by the internal oblique and transverse muscles, and by the fascia transversalis. The inguinal canal of the adult follows an oblique course, and about an inch intervenes between the upper and under apertures of that canal. The upper part of this inguinal ca- nal, called upper abdominal internal aperture, is formed by the transverse and internal oblique muscles, and the fascia transversalis ; and the external or lozver abdominal aperture, is formed by the disunion of the tendons of the external ob- lique muscle. In the fcetus, the spermatic cord passes directly through the parietes of the abdomen. The internal or posterior part of the crural arch is always distinct. It is marked by a white line in the tendon, which extends from the anterior spinous process ot the os ilium to the linea ilio-pectinea, and feels like a tense cord when the limb is extended; but, when the thigh and leg are raised to

OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS. 219 is much variety in the form of the head, as well as in the complexion and features. The general characters are the following :—The complexion is of a reddish-brown or copper- colour. In the form of the head of the aboriginal inhabitants there is much variety ; and, in many instances, it is altered by art, as has been already observed. The face is flat and broad, but not so much so as in the Mongolian Class; the cheek-bones are high, the nose is prominent, the mouth is large, the eyes are brown, and lodged deeply in their sockets. I have two casts of American Indians ; and, in these, the forehead cannot be said to be much depressed, (I have seen it much more so in the skulls of the natives of this country, and in one particularly, which was found in digging out the foundation for our new Library, and which had be- longed to a person who had existed 400 years ago) ; but, in both casts, the forehead is considerably narrower than in the greater number of European skulls ; the face is broad across the cheek-bones ; the other bones of the face are large; also the cavity for the nose, and the sockets for the eye. The measurements are as follows:—From the root of the nose to the most prominent part of the os occipitis, the dis- tance is inches in both casts; and in both, the back-part of the head had been evidently compressed. The breadth from the most prominent part of the one parietal bone to that of the other, is equal to 5fth inches in one of the casts, and in the other, to 5f ths of an inch. Dr Richardson informed me, that, during his travels, along with Captain Franklin, through the northern parts of America, he had met with three distinct tribes of Indians, v/ho spoke different languages ; all of these somewhat resem- bled each other; the countenances of the men were more different than those of the women, and some of the former had aquiline noses. The form of their heads was somewhat like that of the Eskimaux; the forehead was remarkably narrow, but not low, nor was there any appearance as if pres- sure had been applied to flatten it; indeed, he assured me, that no such custom prevailed amongst these northern In-

32 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. where bone is growing, the bloodvessels of this membrane are very numerous. The veins corresponding with these arteries may sometimes be seen in subjects that die full of blood. This membrane has also its nerves. In the healthy state, it possesses but little sensibility, but -when under the influence of inflammation, as in deep seated paronychia, or when stretched by nodes growing from the subjacent bones, the patient suffers excruciating pain, which is often relieved by dividing it freely. Lymphatic vessels are also proper to the periosteum; by disease it attains, in some cases, an unnatural thickness, and, in process of time, regains its natural thinness, which can be the result only of the action of the lymphatic vessels. The periosteum is subservient to several very important uses. lsZ, To assist in the formation of bones. 2cZ, To support the vessels in their passage to the bones. 3d, To strengthen the conjunction of the bones with their epiphyses, ligaments and cartilages, which are easily sepa- rated in young creatures, when this membrane is taken away. 4th, To afford convenient origin and insertion to several muscles, which are fixed to this membrane. 5th, By means of the periosteum, the muscles, when they contract, or are stretched, move and slide easily upon the bones; whereby the effect of friction is averted. The intimate Structure of Bones. Bones are composed of a great many plates *, which are obvious, by very long boiling, and in bones that have been long exposed to the weather, and also in some of the diseases of bones;â€”and each of the layers is made up of fibres united by smaller fibrils ; which being irregularly disposed and in- terwoven with the other large fibres, make a reticular work *h The plates are said j to be firmly joined to each other by * Squamae, bracteae, laminae. + Malpigh.

142 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. On .the external side of the bony part of this canal, and at the top of the chink in the cavity that receives the condyle of the lower jaw, the small nerve which is reflected from the lingual branch of the fifth pair, is situated. Another hole is common to the temporal and occipital bones; it gives passage to a vein from the external teguments to the lateral sinus : But, in some subjects, a branch of the occipital artery passes through this hole, which is spent on the back part of the dura mater; in others, I have seen two or three such holes : But they are oftener wanting than found. The internal surface of the ossa temporum is unequal; the upper circular edge of the squamous part having numerous small ridges and furrows for its conjunction with the parietal bones ; and the rest of it being irregularly marked by the con- volutions of the middle part of the brain, and by furrows made by the branches of the arteries of the dura mater. From the under part of this internal surface, a large trans- verse hard craggy protuberance, the pars petrosa, runs ho- rizontally inwards and forwards, with a sharp edge above, and two flat sides, one facing obliquely forwards and out- wards, and the other as much backwards and inwards. To the ridge between these two sides, the large lateral process of the dura mater is fixed. Notwithstanding the great hardness of this part of the tem- poral bone, it has sometimes been broken in consequence of a fall on the head, and such injuries very often prove fatal; the fracture extends across the base of the skull. This fracture may sometimes be distinguished by the extreme urgency of the symptoms, and the considerable discharge of blood from the ears. Sometimes a small sesamoid bone is found between the narrow extremity of this petrous process, and the sphenoid bone *â€¢ * Riolan, Comment, de Ossib. cap. 32.

535 OF THE JEJUNUM AND ILEUM. In the convex side of this curve, the thick extremity of the larger pancreas and the little pancreas are lodged ; the superior mesenteric artery and vein coming through the notch between the larger and lesser pancreas, hang loose before the gut here, and the ductus communis cholidochus, after passing behind the gut a little higher, unites commonly with the pancreatic duct, very little above the lowest part of the curve ; and, af- ter passing obliquely through the coats of the gut, the two docts open by one common orifice in the posterior part of the duodenum. After the curve above described, the duodenum is involved in the root of the mesentery, and mounts oblique- ly towards the left side; it rises forwards, and ends in the jejunum. Of the Jejunum and Ileum. The Jejunum and Ileum constitute the greater share of the intestinal tube, and describe many turns, which fill the greater part of the umbilical and hypogastric regions, and also fall down into the cavity of the pelvis. As the different portions of the intestinal tube are fixed to the body by a long mesentery, they are readily pushed out of their usual place, when any of the bowels of the abdomen or pelvis have attained an unnatural bulk; or when much com- pressed by the diaphragm, they are often forced into a hernial sac ; and more especially the ileum, which, from having the longest mesentery, is, therefore, the most moveable portion of the smaller intestines. The peritonaeum, the bond of union between the several bowels of the abdomen, and the medium by which they are fixed to the body, is occasionally much elongated ; hence the liver, spleen, and caput caecum coli, which are commonly fixed down to a certain place, have sometimes got into a her- nial tumour. The peritonaeum even admits of a transposition of the bowels; hence the colon of the left side has passed into a her- nia at the right groin, or that of the right side has got into a hernia of the left side. The elongation of the peritonaeum is still more remarkable;

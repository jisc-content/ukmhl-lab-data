The foramina for the transmission of the hy- poglossal nerves, seem uniformly larger in the black than in the white race of mankind, which would indicate the existence of a proportionally large nerve. The cranium of the Bosch- man, viewed vertically, is nearly equal to the well formed Eu- * The description taken from Bbumenbacii. -|- The description taken chiefly from a Hottentot cranium in the possession of Dr Monuo; and partly from a cast of the Hottentot Venus, in the Museum of the University.

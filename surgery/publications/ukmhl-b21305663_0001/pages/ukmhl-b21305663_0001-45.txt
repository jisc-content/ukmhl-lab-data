XXXIX PREFACE. different animals, and upon the use ot the Papillse > and also the observations of Blumenbach upon the Palate, as being the seat of the sense of taste. I have also directed the attention of the reader to the means of stopping bleeding from the tongue; to the safest method of removing portions of that organ, when in a cancerous state; to the cutting of the Fras- num Liuguse; and to Ranula. Several observations are introduced, when treating of the Sense of Touch, upon the acuteness of this sense and of that of Smell, in the blind ; and upon - the colour of the skin of the inhabitants of different parts of the globe. In describing the course of the particular nerves, various observations relative to the uses and to the dis- eases of particular nerves are introduced. Many of the observations of Mr Swan, Mr C. Bell, Mr Wallace, Dr Hennen, Larry, and other au- thors, are noticed. In describing the Sympathetic Nerve, I have given the various opinions of Bock, Lobstein, and others on that head. The experiments of Lobstein on that remarkable nerve, and also several made by myself, have also been mentioned. The attention of the reader has been directed, in an especial manner, to the Anatomy of the Spinal Cord, at various periods of life ; and to the discoveries of Mr C. Bell, as to the nerves connected with it; to which are added the results of the observations of Dr Wilson Philip, on the Spinal Cord, upon the Heart, and other organs. Part VII. of the Elements is devoted to the de- scription of the Lymphatic or Absorbent System.

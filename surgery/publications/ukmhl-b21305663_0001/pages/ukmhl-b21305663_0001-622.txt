There are on the internal surface of the gall-bladder a number of follicles, especially near to its neck ; these secrete a mucous fluid, to defend the inner membrane from the acri- mony of the bile. The neck of the gall-bladder, as also the duct connected with it, called cystic, describes a tortuous course ; and, upon opening the latter, there are 16 or 18 transverse folds of a se- milunar shape, which probably act like valves, and retain the bile for1 a longer time within the organ, and also a few smaller folds in the common duct. Sir E. Home, in support of his opinion, that the contents of the lower intestines are converted into fat, by means of bile, has observed :—“ A child was born at the full time, and lived for several months, but never appeared to increase in size ; although it fed heartily, and had regular stools. The food appeared perfectly digested. There was no bile in the stools, and the skin was of a dark yellowish brown co- lour. I saw the child while alive, and was struck with its want of growth, and its having no fat under the skin, which made it appear larger than new-born children generally are. Upon examining the body after death, the only malformation met with was, that there was no gall-bladder, and no duct leading from the liver into the duodenum. “ From what happened in this case, a supply of fat seems necessary for growth; for the child was by no means wasted in its muscles, which it must have been, had the constitution not been supplied with nourishment SECTION II. OF THE LIVER OF THE FffiTUS. The liver of the foetus is proportionally much larger than that of the adult, and it is proportionally larger in the very young embryo, than in the foetus of nine months, so that it occupies not only the hypochondriac, but also a part of the • Sir E.

29 CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE RONES. III.—Continued. 100 Parts consist of Animal Matter. £ CtJ « Pars petrosa of the temporal bone of a whale. 27-4 72.6 Pars petrosa of the temporal bone of an elephant, 30.0 70.0 The perpendicular lamella' of the vertebra of the I large animal found on the shore of the Island r 44.5 55.5 of Stronsa *, The internal cellular lamellar part of the same, 1 52 47-9 penetrated by small foramina, • • J The fibrous part of the texture, having the ap-1 pearance of willow, forming the cavity of the r 60.0 40.0 same vertebra, ' “ Observations.—The loss which the different bones sus- tained by calcination, is considered as the proportion of ani- mal matter entering into their composition. This method of forming the estimate, though not perfectly accurate, is yet certainly near the truth, and apparently well adapted for com- parative purposes. “ The results contained in the different tables vary so much that they scarcely admit of any general conclusions being drawn from them. ” Between the diseased bones there is the greatest diffe- rence of the proportions of the constituent parts. Some of the bones marked rickety, contain more, and some less, earth,, than the same hemes in their healthy state.—The latter, it may be conjectured, belonged to the disease in its early stage; and the former to a stage of convalescence or recovery. Ihe results of the 1st Table shew, that the proportions of earth and of animal matter vary in different healthy bones of the same person, and in the similar bones of different per- sons ; that in old age, the phosphate of lime apparently in- creases in quantity in the occipital, and diminishes in the jaw V idc Description of this Animal, Memoirs of the Werneiian Natural His- tory Society, vo’. i. 1

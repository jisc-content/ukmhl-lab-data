The in- sertion of the muscle which raises the eyeball, and which has therefore been called Levator Oculi, and the Obliquus Infe- rior Oculi, are also imperfectly seen. Occipito-Frontalis Muscle. The occipito-frontalis muscle consists of two distinct parts, an anterior and posterior, which are united by a thin tendi- nous membrane. This membrane covers each side of the skull, as low down as the attollens aurem, to which it is fixed, and also to the zygoma, and it covers a part of the aponeurosis of the temporal muscle. The muscular stratum in front takes its rise from the superciliary ridge of the frontal bone, and that behind, from the transverse ridge of the os occipitis. A small portion of the anterior part of this muscle is fixed into the internal angular process of this bone, and into the root of the ossa nasi. This muscle corrugates the skin of the head, throws the forehead into wrinkles, and raises the eye- brows. The muscles proper to the ears, nose, and eye-lids, are described at the same time as the organs to which they are af- fixed. Muscles which move the Lower Jaw, and which are subser- vient to the Mastication of the Food. The under jaw is elevated and moved laterally by the Tem- poro-Maxillaris inferior, the Jugo-Maxillaris, and the Ptery- goid muscles. The power of these muscles is very great, even in the hu- man body, of which many striking examples are to be found in the works of Vesalius and Haller. In carnivorous ani- mals, these muscles are of a much greater thickness and strength. Temporo-Maxillaris Inferior, or Temporal Muscle. This muscle is covered by the tendinous aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis muscle, by the attollens aurem, and by the superficial temporal artery, veins and nerves. The Temporal Muscle takes its origin from its Aponeurosis, and from the Temporal Fossa, formed by the Os Frontis,

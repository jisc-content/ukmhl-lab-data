From having had various opportunities of study- ing nature in her truest colours, by a careful- ex- animation of the healthy human subject a few hours only after violent death, I have endeavoured to con- vey to the mind of my reader a correct idea of the co- lour of the internal parts of the living body. This kind of knowledge may prove essentially useful to the surgeon when he is required to determine, in cases of fracture of the skull where the brain has been expo- sed, or iu cases where a portion of the intestines has been exposed, whether these be inflamed or not; and in various other accidents and operations of Surgery, this knowledge must also be useful. The examination of the body, while still warm, may furnish data for determining, whether in the living body there be any watery fluid within the ventricles of the brain,—between the capsule and bo- dy of the crystalline lens,—and within the pericar- dium, and may be useful also to the Student of Medi- cal Jurisprudence. rn this work care has been taken to introduce, those observations upon the minute structure of several or- gans which elude our unassisted sight, and are disco- verable only by the use of the microscope. In this department I have received considerable assistance from that distinguished philosopher Dr Brewster, and from the observations of Mr Bauer. These volumes will be found to contain much va- luable and original information, which I have derived from the manuscripts of my Grandfather and Father, and from my medical colleagues and other friends; and I have endeavoured to include all the most mo-

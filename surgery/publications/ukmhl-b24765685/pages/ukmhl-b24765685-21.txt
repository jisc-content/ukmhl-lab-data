( 7 ) Diagnosis.—1, from other surgical fevers ; 2, from ague ; 3, from rheumatism ; 4, from hectic. Prognosis, Treatment. 1—Local anodynes. 2—Early opening and thorough drainage. 3—? Amputation. 4—Stimulants. Hospital Gangrene. Symptoms.—Local and constitutional. Causes. 1—Overcrowding. 2—Want of ventilation. 3.—Bad hygiene generally. 4—Contagion. 5—Unhealthy state of wound. Treatment. 1—Preventive. 2—Destroy sloughing surface. 3— Iodoform, Bromine, Iodine. 4—Restrain haemorrhage. 5—Nourish and support. 6—Opium. 7—Tonics. Preventive treatment of Septic disease. 1. Hygienic. 1—Space. 2—Ventilation. 3—Conservancy. 4—Cleanliness. 5—Disinfection. 6—Isolation. II. Constitutional.—Examine condition of organs and correct remediable constitutional disturbances. III. Local.—Prevent putrefactive fermentation in wound. Doctrines on which Listerism is founded. 1.—That putrefactive fermentation is due to particulate organisms (bacteria—germs.) 2. That the atmosphere is always loaded with these and every object with which the air comes in contact covered with them. 3. That unless inoculated with germs, putrescible fluids do not undergo putrefaction. 4. That these germs are capable of being rendered inert by certain agents (germicides), 5. That impure air and other objects can thus be rendered pure. 6. That by the use of certain appliances the process of putre- factive fermentation can be excluded from wounds and abscesses, 7. That, when this is accomplished, repair takes place physio- logically, and pathological and septic processes are averted.

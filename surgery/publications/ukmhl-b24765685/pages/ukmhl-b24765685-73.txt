Special forms of gangrene. 1. Hospital gangrene. 2. Bed sore. 3. Gangrena Senilis. Amputation in Gangrene. Amputate at once— 1. When mortification is inevitable and dependent on local causes ; the constitution being good, (e. g. smash, lacerated artery, ligature of artery, traumatic aneurism, &c.) 2. When mortification due to local causes has occurred, the constitution being gound and risk of constitutional infection exists.

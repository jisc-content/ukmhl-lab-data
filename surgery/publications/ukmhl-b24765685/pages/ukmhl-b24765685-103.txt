( 11 ) III. —Seat of constriction. 1—Neck of sac. 2—Thickened tissue outside of neck. 3—Ring. 4—Horn* glass con- traction. 5—Bands or aperture. IV. —Consequences of strangulation. 1—Swelling and change of colour and consistence of contents. 2—Effusion into sac. 3—Congestion of sac. 4—Inflammation of contents, sac and coverings. 5—Gangrene of contents, sac and coverings. 6—Sloughing 'of contents, sac and coverings. 7—Peritonitis. V. Symptoms. Local, (a)—Increased size; (b)—Increased tension ; (c)—Irreducibility ; (d)—Pain ; (e)—Absence of impulse. 2 Constitutional, (a)—Constipation ; (b)—Vomiting (c)— Restlessness ; (d)—If peritonitis, hard, small, quick pulse, dry tongue, fever, &c. (e) If gangrene, cessation of pain, hiccup, clammy skin, cold sweats, prostration, &c. VI Diagnosis, From—1—obstructed irreducible hernia. 2—in- flammed irreducible hernia. YII Prognosis depends on degree of tension and constriction, age of hernia and duration of strangulation. YII I Treatment. Principles. 1—Reduction of hernia. 2— Division of constriction. 1. The taxis—(a) Method of application ; (b) Auxiliaries—i. relaxation by position ; ii. inversion ; Hi. chloroform ; tv. ice ; v. warm bath, opium, &c. 2. Herniotomy—(a) Without opening sac—(b) With opening sac—(c) risks ; i. wounding artery or intestine; ii. inflam- mation ; (d) Treatment of contents when—i. congested ; ii. inflamed ; Hi. gangrenous ; iv. adherent. (e) Radical cure. 3. Persistent strangulation after reduction by taxis—Bryant’s four varieties ; (a) Reduction en bloc; (J)Thrusting between layers of abdominal wall ; (c) Rupture of sac; (d) Reduction of neck. III. ANEURISM. Definition. A tumour containing blood communicating with the interior of an artery.

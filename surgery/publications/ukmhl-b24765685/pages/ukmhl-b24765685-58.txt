THE PROCESS OF REPAIR. Repair presupposes injury or disease causing solution of conti- nuity. Haemorrhage a constant feature of the former. Violence causing injury may be direct or indirect. Wound may or may not be exposed to causes of putrefaction. There may or may not be death of tissue. . Classification of Injuries. /.—Simple solution of continuity. (Incised and punctured wounds inflicted by keen-edged weapons.) 1. Not exposed to septic influences. 2, Exposed to septic influences. II.—Solution of continuity with laceration. (Injuries inflicted by blunt instruments including gunshot wounds, and by indirect violence.) 1. Not exposed to septic influences. (1) Bruise ; (2)—- Rupture of soft parts ; (3) Simple fracture ; (4)— Simple dislocation. 2. Exposed to septic influences. (1)—Lacerated wounds of all kinds ; (2) Rupture of soft parts ; (3) Compound fracture ; (4) Compound dislocation. HI.—-Solution of continuity with loss of substance. (Incised and lacerated wounds in which a portion of the body has been removed.) 1. Not exposed to septic influences. 2. Exposed to septic influences. IV.—Solution of continuity consequent on disease. (Lesions caused by inflammation, suppuration, ulceration, gangrene, &c. 1. Not exposed to septic influences. 2. Exposed to septic influences. Classification of modes of repair—(Paget’s.) 1—Immediate union. 2—Healing by scabbing. 3-vUnion/bv pHman 4— Repair by granulation. General Considerations. 1—Inuammatiod hot nec£ repair. 2—Some tissues capable of restoration, others not so. 3—-Essential element of repair—granulation cells. 4—Phenomena of repair.—(1) Dilatation of blood-vessels j (2)—Effusion of

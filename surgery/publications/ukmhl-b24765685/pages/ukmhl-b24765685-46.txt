( 20 ) Situation.—Cylindrical on raucous surfaces,—-nose, rectum, uterus; racemose in racemose glands, mamma, parotid, &c. Age.—Polypus in children, racemose in young adults. Sex.—Women most liable to racemose adenomata. Natural history.—Grow slowly ; do not infect locally or generally. Diseases.—Cystic developments—from absence of ducts. Degenerations.—Fatty, mucous. Inconveniences, —Deformity, size. Carcinomata. General characters. 1—Developed from epiblast and hypoblast. 2— Consist of epithelial proliferations in meshes of fibrous stroma. 3— Infiltrate surrounding tissues. 4—Infect lymphatic glands and viscera. 5—Elements short lived and prone to degeneration. 6— Cachexia accompanies. 7—Apt to prove fatal. 8—Sometimes hereditary. Varieties. 1—Epithelioma ; 2—Scirrlius ; 3—Encephaloid ; 4— Cylindroma ; 5—Colloid. Structure, fyc.—Cylinders and cavities full of epithelial cells contained in a vascular fibrous stroma infiltrated with small round cells. .Relative amount of cells and stroma differs in several varieties. In colloid cells undergo mucous degeneration, bursting and giving rise to colloid cavities.. ■NHL Situation.—Generally skin, mucous mer glands ; secondarily, lymphatic glands, lungs, liver and other viscera. Special seats. Epithelioma.—Lips, tongue, mouth, eye- lids, penis, vagina, anus, and integument. Scirrlius.—Mamma, oesophagus, pylorus, sigmoid flexure, rectum, penis, skin. Ence- phaloid.—Testes and mamma. Cylindroma.—Digestive tube. Colloid.—Stomach, omentum, peritoneum and rectum. Age.—Advanced life. Sex.—Females more liable. Natural history. 1—Very vascular, 2—Infiltrate surrounding tissues. 3—Infect locally and generally. 4—Cell elements short lived. Origin. Theories, (a) (Thiersch and Waldeyer) from epithelium ; (h) (Koster) from endothelium of lymphatics ; (c) (Classen) from wandering leucocytes. Question of constitu- tional or local origin.

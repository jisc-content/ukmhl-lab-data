(e) If gangrene, cessation of pain, hiccup, clammy skin, cold sweats, prostration, &c. VI Diagnosis, From—1—obstructed irreducible hernia. 2—in- flammed irreducible hernia. YII Prognosis depends on degree of tension and constriction, age of hernia and duration of strangulation. YII I Treatment. Principles. 1—Reduction of hernia. 2— Division of constriction. 1. The taxis—(a) Method of application ; (b) Auxiliaries—i. relaxation by position ; ii. inversion ; Hi. chloroform ; tv. ice ; v. warm bath, opium, &c. 2. Herniotomy—(a) Without opening sac—(b) With opening sac—(c) risks ; i. wounding artery or intestine; ii. inflam- mation ; (d) Treatment of contents when—i. congested ; ii. inflamed ; Hi. gangrenous ; iv. adherent. (e) Radical cure. 3. Persistent strangulation after reduction by taxis—Bryant’s four varieties ; (a) Reduction en bloc; (J)Thrusting between layers of abdominal wall ; (c) Rupture of sac; (d) Reduction of neck. III. ANEURISM. Definition. A tumour containing blood communicating with the interior of an artery.( 12 ) Varieties. 1—Traumatic (varicose aneurism and anenrismal varix ). 2—Non-traumatic. (a)—Cylindrical, (b)—Fu- siform. (c)—Sacculated, (d)—Dissecting. True and false aneurism—circmscribed and diffused. Causes. 1—Diseases of arterial coats (atheroma). 2.—Violence. Pathological changes. 1—Inflammatory thickening of adventitia and surrounding tissues. 2—Coagulation of contained blood. 3—Gradual increase in size. Effects on neighbouring parts. 1—Interference with distal circulation. 2—Disturbance of innervation. 3—Absorp- tion of bone, &c. Terminations. 1—Diffusion. 2—Sloughing. 8—Opening on surface. 4—Opening into adjoining cavities and tubes. 5— Gangrene of limb. 6—Spontaneous cure. Modes of spontaneous cure. 1—Inflammation. 2—By sloughing 3— By coagulation of contents. 5—By plugging. 6—By compression of artery. Symptoms. 1—Swelling. 2—Fluctuation. 3—Pulsation (dis- tensile). 4—Effect of proximal compression. 5—Bruit. 6— Symptoms depending on pressure, &c. 7—Symptoms depending on interference with distal circulation. Diagnosis. 1—From tumours ; (a) pulsating ; (b) non-pulsat- ing. 2—From other fluid swellings. Prognosis. For the most part unfavourable. Treatment. Principles. 1—Diminish blood pressure. 2—Delay or abolish circulation through tumour. 3—Promote coagulability of blood. Methods 1—Medical treatment. 2—Compression. 3—Flexion. 4— Esmarch’s bandage. 4—Ligation of artery. 5—Mani- pulation. 6—Injection of ergotine, &c. 7—Galvanic punc- ture. 8—Setons. 9—Laying open sac. 10—Amputation of limb.\ V -

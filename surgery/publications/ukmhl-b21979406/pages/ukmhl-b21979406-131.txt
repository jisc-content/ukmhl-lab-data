It gives great support, and clings with such tenacity that it does not readily become loose, or come down while the patient walks. Let us imagine that the right hand or loot has been already covered in, as formerly described, and that the lew spiral turns usually made at the wrist or ankle have been completed. In place then ot making a reverse at once, the spiral is continued to the posterior aspect of the limb.

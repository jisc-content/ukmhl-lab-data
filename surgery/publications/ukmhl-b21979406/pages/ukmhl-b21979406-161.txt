Materials.—posterior splint with a foot-piece—a Macintyre—will suit; Domet bandages; a piece of diachylon-plaster, large enough to cover the anterior and lateral aspect of the thigh, and cut away in a horse-shoe form so as to fit the patellar region (to the horns of the shoe extension-tapes should be fixed); weight and pulley; wire cradle. Treatment.—Bandage the foot and leg, apply the plaster, and carry the bandage up over it, excluding the knee and extension-tapes. Lay the limb extended on the posterior splint, and incorporate both with a bandage. Swing the limb on the cradle, raising the foot. -Fracture of Patella treated by elastic extension on the inclined plane. and put on the weight and pulley. Should the joint be very tense, careful aspirations may prove beneficial. An ice-bag, or elastic pressure exercised through the medium of a mass of cotton-wool, will also aid in preventing effusion; but, as a rule, this is not required when the case is seen early. th™;,a^LrsTo;ren^;^;rlse^^1. ^'^^ -^-^^^^S se^u^ef wiiht'^Tr'^ ^ff"'^~^y ^l^'iic Tubing.-l^-, place of using the weight and pulley, some surgeons attach the two extremities of a

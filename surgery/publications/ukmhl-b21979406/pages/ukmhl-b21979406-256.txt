A soft rubber catheter may be transfixed with a safety-pm, to the ends of which fixing threads may be attached, while to a gum-elastic catheter loops of wire or silk may be made fast for a similar purpose. These fixing threads must in turn be themselves made fast, and many ways of so doing have been advocated. Sir Henry Thomson advises that they should be looped round the penis, and finally tied to a bundle of pubic hairs on each side. This is easily done. Others fix them to the penis with sticking plaster. A more usual method may be described as follows (Fig. 186):— Fig. i86.—Tying in a Catheter. To a waist-band passing between the trochanters and iliac crests are fixed in front two thigh loops ; and to these opposite the middle Of the scrotu/n are firmly knotted the threads which are fixed to the catheter. Unless the catheter threads are knotted to the thigh loops well back, the instrument will slide forwards out of the penis. CHAPTER XXVI. TRUSSES AND ARTIFICIAL LIMBS. Contents.—A.

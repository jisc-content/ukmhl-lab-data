JOINT-FIXATION AND FIXED APPARATUS. 193 the arm to the side—the hand being placed on the opposite breast. When additional steadiness is required, a shoulder-cap of paste- Fig. 161.—Esmarch's stirrup- Spliut. 162.—Volkman's anterior wooden Splint. board or poroplastic felt must be fitted to the shoulder, and bandaged in position. It must be shaped as shown in the diagram (Fig. 92). (S) The Elbow-joint.—When absolute rest is required, the hand and fingers should be fixed as well as the elbow, for not only is the whole elbow-joint more or less involved in pronation and supination, but since the fle.xors and extensors of the fingers arise near the elbow-joint and pass across it, their contraction must involve some stimulation of the parts near the joint, as well as excite it by movement. A recttmgidar splint is the form most usually chosen. It may be of wood, of which a set of different sizes may be kept ready with advantage. Many, however, prefer to cut the splints, as wanted, from paste-board or poroplastic felt. The following is a simple method of doing this :— Cut out a square of paper, with the sides equal to the distance from the acromion process to the point of the elbow (Fig. 163).

ANTISEPTICS AND WOUND-TREATMENT. 2$ Fig. 5.—Irrigation of Wound. fresh pad put over all. If the discharge be in quantity, a new dressing is required. Genei-al Remarks.—With absorbable drains and stitches, all may be left untouched for an indefinite length of time should a favourable course be pursued. When ordinary tubes and sutures have to be removed, the tubes may be taken out in 24 hours, the deep stitches on the third, and superficial on the seventh days. A sliglit rise of temperature generally takes place on the second or third evening in any case, but there is no occasion to dress unless something has gone wrong with the wound, as is evidenced by the rise being over 100° F., by quickening of the pulse, or by local pain or disturbance, without other known cause. Moist dressings may be used in septic cases, and where there is a copious discharge. They consist of ordinary dressings applied moist and covered with guttapercha or mackintosh and should be changed daily. Attempts to carry out a thoroughly a-septic surgeiy, that is, tlie ideal treatment, where one would operate in an a-septic room with a-septic surroundings and dressings, have not as yet taken a practical form. Sterile water prepared by repeated boiling should, however, always be available, since it is the best agent with which to wash out the peritoneal cavity. In its place, warmed boric lotion may be used, Sterilization ol instruments presents no difficulty, vide p. 26S.

ANTISEPTICS AND WOUND-TREATMENT. 28 knee, however, could thus be immersed. The leg would require to be flexed at the thigh, with the knee raised. In Vienna, bad cases ot burn to the trunk have been treated by continuous immersion of the whole body. Irrigation with antiseptic lotions may be employed where the bath is not available. The method of carrying it out is indicated in the illustration (Fig. 5). Instead of syphon tubes, two or three threads of worsted are generally enough. (3) Punctured Wounds, {i.e. those in which the depth of the wound is out of proportion to its other dimensions), owe their danger to risk of hemorrhage, in the first place, and to sepsis and confine- ment of discharge, in the second. Should there be reason, from the appearance and condition of the patient, from the state of the parts, and from the probable direction of the wound, to fear hteraorrhage, the surgeon should try temporarily to control the circulation in the part, and after enlarging the wound to find and secure the injured vessel. In an inaccessible region such as the chest, rest, quiet, cold, and internal styptics, are alone available. When rise of temperature, pain, and other signs of inflammation render the advent of sepsis probable, free incisions are indicated. In ordinary cases, punctured wounds maybe treated like compound fractures—i.e., with the view of rendering and keeping them a-septic. (4) When tendons are divided they are drawn up by tonic mus- cular contraction so that the ends become widely separated. They should, however, be united by catgut sutures. When there is any difficulty in finding the drawn-up ends they will be readily brought into view by bandaging from above downwards. (5) Nerve Injuries.—When a nerve is completely divided, the muscles supplied beyond the point of section remain powerless until union takes place. The expected sensory disturbance may be complete, or it may be only partial, or even non-existent, because

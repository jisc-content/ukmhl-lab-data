A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. 99 bf cones, with bases or apices opposed, with here and there perhaps a short cyhnder. In the lower limb, for example, we may trace a pone as we pass from the toes to the heel, another from the heel to Fig. 40.—Machine for Rolling Bandages. the ankle; at the ankle, we may meet with a short cylinder, which is continued upwards as a cone gradually expanding at the calf of the leg; and so on. Rules for Bandaging.—General rules to guide one in bandaging may be laid down as follows:— (1) Fix the bandage. (2) Bandage from below upwards, and from within outwards, over the front of the limb. (3) Use equable pressure throughout. (4) Let each succeeding turn overlap two-thirds of its predecessor. (5) Keep all the margins parallel, and let the crossings and reverses be in one line, and rather towards the outer aspect of the limb. (6) End by fixing the bandage securely. Typical Cases—(a.) How to Bandage the Foot.—Let us exemplify this by covering in the left leg. Stand in front of the patient, who extends his foot. Grasping the roller in the right hand, lay the tail against the ball of the great toe. The bandage must now be carried in a loop around the ankle, and back again to the point from which it started (Fig. 41, A). Therefore, let the head roll on the dorsum of the foot to the outer malleolus, behind the ankle to the inner malleolus, across the dorsum and the first turn to the ball of the little toe, and beneath the sole to the great toe, thus making a double loop, or figure-of-eight, and fixing the end. We now proceed to cover in the limb by taking a complete turn over the dorsum of the foot at the roots of the toes, ascending on the inside with a gentle spiral. We cannot, however, continue this simple spiral, otherwise the bandage would stray and portions of the foot would remain uncovered. The spiral is not suitable for cones, and in order to atone, as it were, for

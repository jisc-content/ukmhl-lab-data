A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. filled, and afterwards to sweep away accumulations within them.* It is carried out either with the flat of the hand or with the edges of the spread-out forefinger and thumb, followed up with the palm of the hand. Muscles and groups of muscles are to be so treated as well as the subcutaneous textures. (2) Friction, "kneading" [Petrissage), or rubbing proper, consists in firm pressure moved over special spots. It is specially apphcable to inflammatory thickenings, in and round joints and tendon sheaths, and in the substance of muscle. It may be done with the finger- tips or knuckles: but the pulp of the thumb will be found specially useful. The operator tries to dispel the thickening, as if by his own efforts, although he knows that probably the chief benefit will result Irom ihe after-vital changes which he sets up. ... Time Necessary.—The time to be occupied at each sitting is a matter of opinion. Dr. Grant, writing after a visit to von Mosengeil's Clinique, believes that in Britain the period is generally too much prolonged. His view is " That when once the muscles have been fairly and completely emptied of venous blood, lyrnph, and waste products, and when once an active afflux of arterial blood has been established, nothing more can be done for the time. In general massage, "every muscle should be subjected to /rw successive processes of cffleuraoe-p^irissage-cffleiirage," and thi.s should be done by rapid movements in from 10 to 15 minutes. In local massa<Te about the same time may be occupied, except where inflammatory thickenings have to be got rid of, when a somewhat lono-er time may be taken. Once a day is generally sufhcient. The Commoner Surgical Conditions in vfhich Massage is applicable, are:— , ^ . r (1) Sti/TJoints, resulting from prolonged fixation for any reason, or followin"'simple inflammation in and round the jomt. _ (Caution.—r/i« stifness folio-wing ''strumous cirthrttis ts generally in old, and always in recent cases, best left alone, lest the %rioinal mischief should be re-excited.) r - a In these cases, the massage is applied to get rid of mflammatoiy thickenings, and to stimulate the growth and activity of muse es which have been atrophied from disuse. To massage must be added hot and cold-douching over the joint and muscles, progressively increased passive and active movements, and faradisation. (2) Inflammatory Thickenings in any accessible part-.;.round urethral strictures, in callous ulcers, m the testis after orchitis, &c (c!) Rheumatic Contractures and Thickenings, where similar apph- cations are made upon the afi-ected muscles and fun over them^ (4) Recent Effusions, to promote absorption of blood serum by effleurage. Some also advise the promotion of absorption of synovial distention in the same way. Massa-e is certainly of value also as an adjunct to other means in the tr atmei^ot recent sprains. In fractures, too, especial y where ihere is much effusion, it may be used to promote absorption and hasten repair. ^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^ _ ^,3^_

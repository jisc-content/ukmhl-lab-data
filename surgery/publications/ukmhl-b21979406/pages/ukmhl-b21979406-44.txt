A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. 25a Lacerated wounds which are difficult to purify, should be treated by immersion m a warm bath of boracic lotion, or corrosive sublimate I to 4,000). In this they may be left lor three or four days, the lotion being changed from time to time. Where this method is inapphcable, a constant irrigation may be maintained with similar lotions, as in Fig. 5 (see further under Lacerated ivounds, p -^y) ^ Wounds which are septic are generally accompanied by pain, lever, inflammation, and unpleasant odour. Strapping.—Strapping is sometimes employed in lieu of stitching or is put on when the wound shows a tendency to gape after the removal of sutures. Much neater and more serviceable, however, is the use of collodion with unprepared gauze. A strip of gauze should be laid over the wound, and one end of it secured to the skin by painting on the col- lodion with a brush. When this dries, traction may be exercised, and the skin pulled towards its opposing flap, which is pushed forwards with the fingers, and the other extremity secured in like manner to the skin. The whole extent of the incision may also be fortified by painting with collodion. Kocher com- ijines bismuth with it, and this forms an efficient species of non-irritating plaster. A doubled fold of gauze may thus be affixed to each side of the wound, and when secured, the two may be brought together by lacing, as in Fig. 6. Strapping under an antiseptic dress- ing, after having been cut to the requisite size, should be washed in carbolic lotion (i to 20). To this is then added an equal quantity of boiling water, and the plaster is now ready for application. Fig. 6.—Closure oi Wound with laced plaster and collodion strap- ping.

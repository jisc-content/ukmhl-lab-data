Various Forms of Splints.—In ordinary fractures, lateral splints of wood or pasteboard are used. They should be shaped to fit the limb (for pasteboard, see Chap. XX.) If of wood they may be cut short at the level of the in- step ; the otiter should have a foot-piece; if made of pasteboard, both had better be provided also with a sole plate. Wooden spUnts should be per- forated at the malleoli, to avoid pressure. The foot piece of the external splint should be well padded to- Fig. 116.—Application of Lateral Splints—Limb wards the toes. After flexed and laid on its outer side. setting the fracture, the splints are buckled or bandaged on, and the limb, laid on its outer side, is secured by slip-knots to a pillow (Fig. 116). In this way pointing of the toes is readily prevented, but eversion of the foot cannot be so readily counteracted. If, however, two lateral splints of wood or pasteboard, each with a foot-piece, be fitted on, and the leg be now suspended from a Salter's cradle (Fig. 117), one can easily see if eversion is thoroughly corrected or not. In cases where back- ward displacement of the heel does not readily yield with the ordinary box-splint, the swinging position may also be taken advantage of. Splints for Potfs Frac- ture.—Special splints are sometimes used in the treatment of Pott's frac- ture and allied conditions, although as a rule such injuries are equally amen- able to the box-splint, {a.) Dupuytren's splint is applied so as to counteract eversion and fix the foot. Although originally plain, as now often modified, it is a long splint in miniature (P"ig. 11S, A), and is applied with the aid of a bandage, slip-knot, and towel. Fold the towel, lay it against the inner aspect of the splint, and fold up the Fig. 117.—Limb slung in Salter's Cradle.

The rectum must be emptied before the operation, and after the patient has been antesthetised, the larger end of the lever must be carefully introduced into the rectum, and passed upwards until it reaches the posterior part of the brim of the pelvis. If the handle be then held firmly up against the pubic arch as a fulcrum, the rectal portion will be pressed down upon the common iliac artery. From the left-sided position of the rectum, the left vessels are generally easily reached-; not so, however, in many cases, those on the right. In fact, unless the rectum be specially capacious, or placed rather more than normally in the middle of the pelvis, there would be a risk of injuring the gut in trying to compress the right vessels.

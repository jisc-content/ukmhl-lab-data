59 SHOCK AND WOUND-FEVER. and reinjected into the veins instead of being lost. Several very desperate cases have been successfully treated in this way, but the greatest care must be taken that the blood is fresh, and not already contaminated with septic organisms. William Hunter believes, as a result of experiment, that phosphate of soda solution hastens the destruction of coloured blood-corpuscles in the liver, and, therefore, that the corpuscles injected along with it are not likely to be of any service, especially as he holds that, in any case, all foreign corpuscles are more or less rapidly destroyed after transfusion of blood. When whipped blood is used, the process is similar, except that Wtiipping with fine twigs, and subsequent straining through muslin, IS used instead of stirring with phosphate of soda solution. The process removes the fibrin, the latter prevents it from There is good ground, however, for believing that neither the phosphate of soda method, nor that with defibrinated blood should he used in preference to the injection of sunple saline solution. Alter careful investigation and experiment on this subject, William Hunter sums up thus :-" Any advantages that transfusion ol red corpuscles may have over simple saline injections are counter- balanced by the dangers attending the simultaneous injection of the white. In the case of defibrinated blood the latter so pre- ponderate that transfusion of defibrinated blood is an operation

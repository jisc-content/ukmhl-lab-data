226 THE URINE. Under the microscope, the crystals are seen to be relatively large, prismatic with bevelled ends, and having forms modified from this by the bevelling of the various sides and angles (Fig. 180, b). Associated with the triple phosphate, there is generally a deposit of amorphous phosphate of lime, although it is often present alone, where fixed alkali produces the alkalinity. To the naked eye it forms a light flocculent deposit, paler than the supernatant urine, and often forming a film on the surface. It is increased by heat and dissolved in acids. In rare cases this substance is deposited in a crystalline form—stellar phosphate—and then, when in any quantity, is considered as usually associated with grave disorder in any part of the body [Roberts). Rare forms of inorganic deposits are cystine, in hexagonal plates (Fig. t8i, A), which forms occasionally the substance of a calculus; xanthine, a substance very like uric acid in its crystals and composition, also in rare cases forming a calculus; and leucin and tyrosin, bodies whose presence is associated with phosphorus poisoning and yellow atrophy of the liver. n.

The light flocculent deposit found in healthy urine consists of epithelial scales shed probably from all parts of the urinary tract, and held together by the mucus ; in women, flattened scales from the vagina will probably be added. In men, especially after gonorrhcea, the epithelial deposit from the urethra and prostate

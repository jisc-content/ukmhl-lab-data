On the other hand, the stitches of apposition which should be free from tension may be left in longer. In any case, an area of redness round any stitch calls for its removal. A method which combines the advantages of the deep and super- ficial suture, and which somewhat resembles the old quilled suture, is largely employed at Bern. The margins of the wound are rendered tense by a couple of sharp hooks inserted into the extremities ol the wound. The surgeon, using a straight needle and fine silk, passes the deep sutures through the entire thickness of the skin a quarter of an inch from its edge. Pieces of red rubber tubing serve to protect

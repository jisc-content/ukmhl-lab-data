A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. (3) on an extemporised stretcher. The great secret in handling a fractured limb is to keep up extension upon it, until the splints be applied. [a.) Extemporary Splints, it is needless to say, may be of any material that will give the necessary stiffness. For shorter splints, a mass of folded paper of any kind does very well, or a folded coat, sacking, or other stout cloth. Nothing is better than the straw envelopes used for packing bottles. Pieces of fire-wood, old wooden or pasteboard boxes broken up, walking-sticks, and umbrellas, are also generally available. A capital splint may be made by knotting together pieces of wood, wisps of hay or straw, or bundles of twigs. This is used in the army, and makes a splint which closely imitates Gooch's, adapting itself easily to the limb (Fig. 129). For binding the Fig. 129.—Extemporised Splint made from Twigs knotted together. splint in position, handkerchiefs, cravats, twine, or rope, may be used. It will be found an additional security (especially in fracture of the thigh, or where the patient has to be carried a long distance) to utilise the sound limb by fixing it to the injured one after the splints have been applied. Three bands are generally enough—one at the ankle, another at the knee, and the third round the thigh. In addition, a board may be fastened below the legs, to make all secure (Fig. 130). A long splint may be extemporised from a Fig. 130.—Steadying the Lower Limb. broom-stick, or any other piece of wood or metal which is about the right length. (/;.)

A patient thus injured may be carried (i) in the arms; (2) on a blanket;

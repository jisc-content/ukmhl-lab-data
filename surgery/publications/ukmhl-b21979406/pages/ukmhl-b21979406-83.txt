SHOCK AND WOUND-FEVER. 62 Finally, the urine itself may become infected Irom a dirty instru- ment, and from this a true catheter-fever, septic in character, due to absorption, may follow. Where other means have been ineffectual, general and local remedies are required. We may attack the fever by specifics such as quinine, antipyrin, and the like, or act on the skin and circulation, and so cause lowering of the temperature. The most energetic mode of cooling the patient is by means of Leiter's iced-water coil (Fig. 29). Fig. 29.—Leiter's Iced-water Coil. This method is also applicable as a local antiphlogistic in inflamma- tion of joints, &c. When there is rise of temperature with a scanty secretion of urine (as, for example, after abdominal operations), the hot " pack " is indicated. This is readily carried out by rolling the patient in a blanket, after placing around him hot bottles enveloped with moist warm flannel or stockings. Inflammations, which threaten to form abscess, often yield to antiseptic poultices. These are made by enveloping the part in boric lint, soaked in carbolic lotion, and covered with mackintosh or guttapercha. Local blood-letting is often serviceable. Blood-letting by leeches, or otherwise, is not often employed now, but may be useful in acute inflammations. (i) By Leechea.—Leeches are to be applied as follows :—The part ot the skm selected is washed and, il hairy, shaved ; it is then dabbed over with milk. The leech or leeches are then taken from the box in which they are usually sent up, and allowed to swim for a few minutes in a basin of clean water. Each, before being applied, should next be al owed to crawl over a clean towel for a few minutes. It is then to be taken up m a wine-glass, or test-tube, which, when inverted, is placed 5

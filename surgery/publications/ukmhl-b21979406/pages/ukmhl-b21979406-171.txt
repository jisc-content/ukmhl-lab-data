ON FRACTURES. 149 [a.) Fracture of the Nasal Bones results from great violence. The frat^ments must be raised from within by a probe, and the septum restored if need be with dressing forceps, as nasal plugs do no good. The patient must be cautioned not to finger the parts, nor to blow his nose violently for a week. If retention is difficult, it is better to give an anesthetic, and skewer the elevated broken bridge with a stout steel pin. (/;.) Fracture of the Upper Jaw.—When the upper jaw is broken, the alveolar margin is usually interfered with, and loose teeth require attention. None should be removed unless they are broken, or their alveoli hopelessly destroyed. Otherwise, they should be replaced, the bone modelled into shape, and the lower jaw bound to the upper by means of a split bandage (Fig. 121); the opposing teeth act as splints. The patient is enjoined absolute quiet, and fed with slops by means of a tube carried from the mouth behind the last molar, or through a dental gap, or from the nose. As a general rule, injuries of the face implicating the malar bone and jaw are severe and complicated with laceration of the soft parts, but are generally hopeful. Every fragment should be retained and sutured, coagula removed, the parts purified, dusted with iodoform, and treated as special circumstances require. (c.) Fracture of the Lower Jaw.—When a patient has sustained a violent blow on the lower jaw, and he is bleeding from the gums with loosening of teeth, 0 Fig. lai.—A, Four-tailed Bandage for Fracture of the Jaws; X, Aperture for the Chin.

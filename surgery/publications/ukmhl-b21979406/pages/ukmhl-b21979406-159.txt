The surgeon next secures one handkerchief to the foot (Fig. 105), and passes the other round the perinceum, so Fig. 107.—Extension by Weight and Pulley. that the two ends may be through the holes in the top of the splint. He next secures the foot to the end of the splint, and now- pushing it downwards, firmly with his hand, thus makes extension at the foot, while he maintains counter-extension from the perineum by tying the top handkerchief (Fig. 108). Obviously before long Fig. 108.—The Long Splint, showing how it must be pushed down in order to obtain extension before securing the perinseal band at the upper end. the tension relaxes as the handkerchiefs give. The perinjeum is apt to suffer and become excoriated: hence, although good results have been obtained with the long splint and perinseal band, the weight and pulley method is far superior. Where with the tilted position of the bed, the patient is uncomfortable, an attempt may be made, by means of a pelvic or thoracic girdle fixing the patient to the bed, to secure counter-extension. Union may be looked for at the end of ten or twelve weeks. Should the patient's constitution resent this treatment, he must be got out of bed into a chair, and only fibrous union be expected. (2) Fractures of the Shaft of the Femur are also treated with the long splint and extension. They require as well lateral local splints of well-padded Gooch or pasteboard, secured with slip-knots. These splints must not encroach on the patella or

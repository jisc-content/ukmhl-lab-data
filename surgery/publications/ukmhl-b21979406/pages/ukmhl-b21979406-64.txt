After this the left hand lets go its own end and grasps the other one, and so on as before i,ither method is equally good. When working in a cavity, the use of the forefingers as pulleys to make the strain transverse, and so prevent the knot from bein^ pulled oft the vessel (Fig. 21, d], is especially important. " The ligature should be a foot long, to pei-mit of tliis firm grasp. It is not necessary to tie the smaller vessels on the face of an easily accessible wound with the same care as a main vessel, or a smaller one in a cavity. Joseph Bell employs a long ligatm-e, which he holds in lais left hand, and uses repeatedly, saving both time and ligature. The ends do not change hands, and the shorter one in the right hand is passed round the other (alternately over and under), and is always grasped again by the same hand. In practice the method answers well. In drawing on the first twist, the hands should be crossed,* and the thumb ot the right hand used like the forefinger to guide the thread. This in an open wound is no objection. The single long end remains coiled up in the left hand, or twisted round the left little finger. * Even if the hands be not crossed the first time, the knot will be drawn pro- perly the second time.

A promment feature, most useful in diagnosi^ is affoS Fig. loi.—(rt) Gordon's Splints for Colles* Fracture, (b) When applied the short prominent ridge supports the upper radial fragment. Fig. I02.—Setting a Colles' Fracture by the examination and comparison of the styloid processes of the bones of the forearm on each side. When this fracture has taken place, the styloids are on the same level, whereas, in the normal limb, that of the radius is always much more prolonged downwards. In the absence of this symptom and of all typical displacement, it is advisable to treat as Colles' fracture the cases where marked tenderness on pressure exists, distinctly localised, just above the wrist, and associated with a history of a fall on the palm. Treatment.—The great essential of treatment is careful and accurate setting. Following this, early passive motion is equally necessary. Special splints present no advantages. Reduction should be carried out at once, and with thoroughness, giving an ansesthetic, if needful. By using powerful extension and counter- extension, and flexing the wrist over the knee in cases of great difficulty, the fragment is restored to its normal position. It shows no great tendency to become again displaced. Padded Gooch splints are then applied. The dorsal reaches to the knuckles, the anterior to the palmar flexure (see Fig. 98). The bandage may include the fingers for the first week. After this date, daily passive motion of the fingers should be carried out, and every third day the splints may be removed, the fracture fixed, and the wrist gently moved. At the end of three weeks, remove all the splints.

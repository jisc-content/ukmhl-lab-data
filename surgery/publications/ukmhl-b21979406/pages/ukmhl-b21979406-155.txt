ON FRACTURES. 133 (7) Fractures of the Metacarpals are associated with displace- ment due to a drooping of the head of the bone. By placing a small pad of wool in the palm of the hand, to prevent the finger- nails from irritating, and bandaging the closed fist over this, fixation is ensured, and union results in three weeks. When the first or fifth meta- carpal has given way, it is, perhaps, better to secure the extended hand and fore-arm to Fig. 103.—Anterior Gooch-splint used by some in CoUes' Fracture. It is cut away in front of the lower fragment of the radius, and only reaches the middle of the palm. This an anterior padded Gooch-splint. method may also be used in all cases. Fractures of the Phalanges are treated by binding the injured finger and its fellows, in the extended position, to a splint, which is prolonged up the forearm. CHAPTER XV. ON FRACTURES—Cwz/z««5^.

Prolonged recumbency can only be earned out on a suitable mattress such as has been already described (p. 120) ; it should be firm, even, and unyielding Prevention of Bed-Sores—Tht formation of bed-sores must be carefully prevented. They occur wherever pressure is kept up over bony prominences, such as the sacrum, heel, region of the buttocks, and popliteal space. Moisture is their chief causation-be it due to unne, sweat, discharge, or lotions. In old and weakly patients, extreme watchfulness can alone combat bed-sores. The patient must be kept absolutely dry. The skin exposed to pressure may be

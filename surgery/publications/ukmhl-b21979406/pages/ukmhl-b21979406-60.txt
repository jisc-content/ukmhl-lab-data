41 A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. being crossed above the great trochanter. To prevent it slipping down the thigh, two supporting bands should draw it upwards at the inside-one in front, and one behind. These may be secured round the trunk or held by assistants (Fig. 13). A large pad and an elastic bandage may also be used to compress the external iliac trig. 14).

Most surgeons, however, prefer the security afforded by mechanical means. (/'.) Close to the Shoulder-Joint.—Many operations can be planned, so as to allow the main vessel to be exposed and grasped before it is divided. In other cases, the third part of the subclavian may be com- pressed against the first rib by a firm pad pressed downwards from above the clavicle by an assistant (Fig. 15). For this pur- pose, an india-rubber tipped compressor has been devised, but the handle of a door-key or other similar instrument, well padded, acts nearly as well. When the greatest security is desired, Mr. Syme's plan should be followed. In a case of axillai7 aneurism, the skin above the clavicle ivas incised, and the cellular tissue separated to allow an assistant's fingers to reach the artery itself, and hold it against the first rib. Sometimes the axillary artery can be controlled by elastic tubing (Figs. 16, 17). In the neck, the cominon carotid may be temporarily compressed against the cervical vertebras, by inserting the fingers beneath the sterno-mastoid and pressing directly backwards. The "carotid" tubercle—i.e., the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, is Fig. TS.—Compression of Subclavian with Com- pressor.

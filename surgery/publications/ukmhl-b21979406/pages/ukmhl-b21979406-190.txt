A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. i68 Objects aimed at in Massage.—These effects of massage are applied— 1. To stimulate the circulation locally or generally; increase metabolism, and encourage nutrition, whether in special groups of muscles, or in the body as a whole. Also to equalise the circulation, and draw blood away from congested areas (e.g., shampooing to induce sleep). Eccles* has shewn that superficial centripetal rubbing increases the pulse rate, probably by returning the blood more rapidly ; while deep muscular shampooing slows the pulse, probably by dilating the vessels in the muscles. 2. To promote absorption of recent or old-standing inflammatory products, and to remove recent effusions of chronic thickenings and adhesions. These latter may be in and around joints, muscles, glands, or nerves, producing corresponding results. 3. By exciting molecular changes to remove certain neuralgias, e.g., some forms of sciatica, and myalgias of the recent rheumatic or lumbago type. 4. Owing to its influence in stimulating the circulation and increasing metabolism, it forms part of the treatment of advanced hysterical emaciation, and has been advocated in narcotic poisoning, and for those apparently drowned. Although an almost endless number of methods of manipulation have been advocated, the chief ones only need be described here. The Movements employed.—The simplest subdivision of the movements is that adopted by Schreiber, who classifies them as "stabile" and "labile." Under the first he includes pressing, tapping (or beating), hacking, pinching, and concussing; under the second, stroking, rubbing, and kneading. (a.) Stabile Movements.—(i) " Pressing" may be done with the * Practitioner, 1887, vol. i.

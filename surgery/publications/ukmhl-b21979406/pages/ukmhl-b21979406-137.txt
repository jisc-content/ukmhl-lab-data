ON BANDAGING. "5 in Y'\<y%. 73 and 74, the elbow and wrist suspended. The loose end may be tucked up, and for neatness, secured with a satety- pin ; but on no account should the pin bear any weight—that is all borne by the longer ends of the handkerchief, which should be tied in a reef-knot. Fig. 79 shows the sling adapted to retain dressings on the head. In a similar way, we may cover in the hand or foot. With one handkerchief rolled as a cravat, and applied so as to give a fixed point, a second may sei-ve to secure a dressing, as in Figs. 77 b Figs. 72 and 73.—Triangular Handkerchief supporting the Elbow, a and b. and 78, where the shoulder and hip are seen covered in. Such examples may suffice. (9) The Square Handkerchief.—K good head-dressing may be formed from a square handkerchief {40 in. square), folded across 4 mches beyond its middle line, and laid over the head, as represented on the left side of Fig. 80. The two outer comers, that is, those of the smaller portion of the napkin, are first carried beneath the inner corners, and tied under the chin. The edge of the inner and larger portion IS then turned up over the forehead, and its corners are secured at the nape of the neck. A four-tailed handkerchief (Fie. Si), and one with six tails, have also been used for a similar purpose. ^10) Suspensory Bandage.-i:his refers to the suspension of the testicles, and may be called for in orchitis and epididymitis, variocele, or when the skin of the scrotum is ulcerated or eczematous.

ON FRACTURES. 135 to a conclusion. Impaction should not be released in old people. An altered position of the trochanters is readily ascertained by the method of Bryant, Morris, or shortly as follows :— Lay the normal line in the same position as its fellow. See that the pelvis is straight. When there is any pelvic obliquity, the lines drawn from / one anterior spme to the other, and from the umbili- cus to the sym- physis pubis, do not intersect at right angles. In- dicate the anterior superior spine and tip of the trochan- ter major on each side with ink; then take a couple of strips of stout sheet-lead, as recommended by Chiene, and lay them across the body, joining the above points. If the tro- chanters occupy the same level on each side, the strips will be parallel. Should they have undergone any change, the direction will be at once obvious, and a conclusion may be drawn as to the nature of the injury. Treatment and prognosis depend largely on the age and strength of the individual. In the case of old people, where the fracture is Fig. 104.—Method of ascertaining level of great trochanters and degree of pelvic obliquity.

43 A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. During the progress of an operation, the mouths of bleeding vessels can be secured ^ as they are divided, or just before it, if the vessels can be seen, and the surgeon may proceed with his work, leaving, per- haps, ten or twelve pairs of forceps hanging on to the sur- face of the wound. In a few minutes he may return to the for- ceps, and find, after tying the larger ves- sels, that the squeez- ing of the smaller ones has completely closed them. Tying of Arteries. —In tying the arter- ies, the forceps should be drawn by an assis- tant, obliquely away from the person who ties, as soon as the ligature has been passed round the ar- tery (Fig. 2i). As the first knot is being tightened, the handle of the forceps should be lowered more and more on the side a- way from the knot, to lessen the risk of including their points. On the knot side, the operator's forefingers ensure that the thread passes well over the forceps. When the thread, thus guided on to the soft parts alone, is being firmly drawn, the forceps must be slipped off, so as to ^'S- 21.—Tying the Reef-Knot, first method. allow of additional tightening. The second knot may then be made.

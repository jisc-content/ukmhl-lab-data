Finally the circular bandage (Fig. 83) binds the elbow to the side, and all is fi.xed by pins. The axillary pad acts as a fulcrum, and thus the shoulder is carried outwards, supported, and steadied; while the sling serves to remedy the downward and forward displacement. The pad is, however, seldom necessary, and as it may be overdone, is liable to cause oedema from pressure. {!>.) Sayre's Method—by Plaster Sh-ips.—This plan, in which the chief factor is support exercised on the elbow, has certain advantages. Materials.—Two strips of strong adhesive plaster, 2% inches broad; boracic lint, or antiseptic wool. Treatment.—'itt the fracture. Fix a loop of the plaster (adhesive side out) around the middle third of the humerus by stitching, and carry it backwards around the trunk (Fig. 84). This serves to pull the shoulder backwards, and is said to give a fixed point lor the second strip. Interpose lint or wadding between the chest and limb, wherever they are in contact. Lay the second strip of plaster against the sound shoulder, and carry it obliquely across the back to the elbow, where a slit should be made to receive the olecranon, and then ascend over the forearm to the starting-point.

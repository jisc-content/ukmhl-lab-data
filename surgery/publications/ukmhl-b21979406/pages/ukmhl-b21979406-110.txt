The inner tube should now be inserted, and the patient put back to bed. After - treatment.— If all has gone well, the condition is now in marked contrast to the previous distress. The breathing becomes so gentle and easy that it is barely perceptible, and quiet sleep comes on. The future of the case depends largely on careful nursing. There should be two nurses to relieve each other. The patient cannot, without danger, be left for a moment alone. Expec- toration must be fav- oured, and this is to some extent promoted by keeping the atmos- phere of the room moist. For this purpose a species of tent may be rigged up around the patient by means of blankets over clothes- screens, and the steam from a couple of bronchitis-kettles carried into it. Towels wrung out of warm carbolic lotion may also be hung up in the room. Uniform temperature of 70° F. should be preserved, and all draughts avoided. Over the mouth of the tracheotomy tube a double fold of fine gauze, wrung out of warm water, should be laid in order to filter the air, and clots or mucus when ejected should be at once dexterously brushed away by the nurse.

zoo A SURGICAL HANDBOOK "^•^t. . . . Windows, scollops, or openings of any kind, do not weaken a splint; and it is better to make them opposite bony prommences, breasts, and other compressed parts, as well as op- posite abscesses, wounds, and compound fractures." This general description will suffice, aided by illustrations after F. Jordan, to explain the application of his method to the spine (lower dorsal, and lumbar regions). - The other applications of the same method have been introduced at the same time to prevent the need for repetition afterwards (Figs. i66, 167, and 168). He further states that while he prefers to apply his spinal splint while the patient is recumbent, the method is equally applicable when the patient is suspended vertically, and is more easy to carry out than Sayre's. Mr. Walker, of Peterborough, invented a similar method, but since it is more complicated, we do. not describe it. (e.) Davy's Method.—Mr. Davy advocates the application of the Sayre plast-cr bandage while the patient is slung prone in a hammock Fig. 168.—Furneaux Jordan's laminated Fig. 169.—Sayre's Jury-mast Fig. 170.—Jury- Plaster Splint for (after Sayre). mast applied the thigh and pel- {after Sayre).

The hammock, as broad as the patient's chest from axilla to axilla, is fastened in front to a stout wooden rod, from whose pro- jecting ends the supporting stays are made fast. The other fend of the hammock, extending beyond the feet, is gathered into a knot, and fixed to a rope with a pulley.

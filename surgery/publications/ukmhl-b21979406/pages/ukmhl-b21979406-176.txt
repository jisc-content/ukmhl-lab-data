A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. It sometimes happens that the radius alone is displaced, and its head IS to be found lying in front of or behind the external condyle. In such a case, the surgeon extends the fore-arm, supinating in the T -"^ J.™' pronating in the second, to get the parts in apposition. It IS difficult to retain; hence, a special pad should be bound over Fig. 127.—Reduction of Backward Dislocation of Elbow over the Knee. its head, and the elbow kept at rest for a longer period than in other dislocations. (4) Dislocation at the Wrist-joint is easily recognised, and as easily reduced. When the phalanges are displaced, there is some little difficulty in getting a grip of the small distal extremity. The toy known as the "Siamese link" gives one a good purchase, or somewhat similar methods may be improvised. (5) Dislocation of the Thumb is often very stubborn. By forcing the metacai-pal well into the centre of the hand, fitting on the Siamese link, making extension in the direction of displacement, and then suddenly and forcibly flexing in the opposite direction, the ligaments and tendons may be so stretched that the reduction takes place. (6) Dislocation of the Lower Jaw.—The recognition of this is simple in the extreme. The patient cannot close his mouth or articulate ; the glenoid articulation is found to be empty ; but the condyle may be felt at the eminentia articularis; the masseter and temporal muscles are tense. The condition may occur on one or both sides. For reduction, the patient sits on a low stool facing the surgeon, who lays his thumb on the last molars of the dislocated jaw, and places his fingers firmly beneath the patient's chin. He then forcibly pushes downwards and backwards witii his tliunibs, upwards and forwards with his fingers ; and as he feels the jaw move, dexterously withdraws his thumbs as reduction is effected.

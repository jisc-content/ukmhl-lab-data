ON BANDAGING. figure-of-eight used to confine dressings or to retain a rupture. There are two forms, the "ascending" and the "descending." To form the first loop of the ascending spica (Fig. 46), lay the tail over the external abdominal ring of the ruptured side, and carry the roller upwards and outwards around the pelvis, midway between the great tro- chanter and the crest of the ilium back to the starting-point, where it crosses the tail. To form the second loop carry the bandage over the outer aspect of the thigh round into the perinssum, and back to the starting-point again. In this way a series of crossings are produced, each higher than the preceding one, with which we may exert pressure all along the line of the inguinal canal. Beneath Fig. 46.—Spica of the Groin each crossing a small flat compress of —Ascending Form. Hnt may be laid SO as to afford sufficient pressure. (5) In Femoral Hernia. — T/ie descending spica is preferred in cases of femoral hernia (Fig. 47). Lay the tail over the saphenous opening, and carry the roller over the symphysis and round the pelvis at the same level as before. As the first loop is completed, the laand- age is next passed downwards into the perinasum and outwards round the thigh back to the starting-point; thus the second loop is finished, and the succeedmg turns iollow in the same manner, each lower than the preceding one. It will be observed that, as regards the successive crossings, the line of support in each case agrees with the

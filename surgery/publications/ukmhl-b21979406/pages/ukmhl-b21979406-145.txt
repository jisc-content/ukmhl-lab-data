12Z ON FRACTURES. Treaiment.—Restore and retain the outer fragment. If the patient be confined to bed with a pillow between his shoulders, the weight of the limb no longer causes downward displacement, and the forward and inward distortion is remedied by the gravitation of the shoulders backwards, counterbalancing and exhausting the muscular action. Although satisfactory results may be obtained in this way, few people care to submit to such restriction and confine- ment, so that generally the patient is not treated in bed. Authori- ties differ as to the measures to be adopted for obtaining satisfactory union. The necessary indications are fulfilled by the following plans, which may be used and modified as circumstances indicate. Fracture of the left clavicle at the junction of its inner and middle thirds.

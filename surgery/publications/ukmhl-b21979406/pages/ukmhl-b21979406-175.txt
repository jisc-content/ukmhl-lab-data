DISLOCATIONS, SPRAINS, AND BRUISES. 153 fixes the shoulder-girdle with one foot, and raises the arm above the patient's head. Second or ''Manipulation" Method of ICocAer.—The so-called "manipulation" method of Kocher is performed by flexing the forearm to a right angle, and then pulling the hand outwards so as to rotate the whole humerus. As this is done, the tip of the elbow may advance a little in front of the chest (Fig. 125). This movement must be carried out with great patience, and should occupy at least five minutes. The surgeon then rapidly elevates the humerus, and rotates it inwards, and circumducts it over the front of the chest (Fig. 126). As he brings it to the side, reduction takes place. ^1 ii Fig. 125.—Kocher's Method—Second Part, Raising the Arm, Internal Rotation and Circumduction. In every case where this is difiScult, chloroform may be given. Subsequent Treatment.—Rest the joint by means of supporting the elbow in a sling, and binding the limb to the side. Begin gentle passive motion at the end of ten days. (3) Dislocations of the Elbow are most readily diagnosed by finding the condyles of the humerus, noting the relation of the head of the radius to the end of the olecranon condyles, carefully ex- plormg the bend of the elbow, and noting to what extent move- ment is interfered with. In the common backward displacement of both bones, the cup-shaped head of the radius is readily detected postenor to the condyle, and the bend of the elbow is filled up with the projected extremity of the humerus. By extension and rapid flexion, reduction takes place ; moreover, this is not attended with crepitus, nor yet with redisplacement when support is withdrawn, as IS so well-marked in cases where the humerus is broken. After eveiy reduction the surgeon must fully flex the limb, in order to satisfy himself that all is right. Treatment is then similar to that for fracture into the elbow-joint (see Fig. 96).

THE URINE. 222 guished from albumen until a few drops of nitric acid are added, when the phosphates will be dissolved, and albumen, if present, coagulated. (/i) Nitric Acid.—" Nitric acid is an extremely delicate test for albumen, and is the test to use first in all cases except when the urine is turbid from urates. The best manner of applying it is to fill a test-tube to the depth of about an inch; then, inclining the tube, to pour in strong nitric acid in such a manner that it may trickle down along the side of the tube to the bottom, and form a stratum some quarter of an inch thick below the urine. Added in this manner, there is scarcely any mingling of the two fluids, and if albumen be present, three strata or layers will be observed—one perfectly colourless, of nitric acid at the bottom; immediately above this an opalescent zone of coagulated albumen; and at the top the unaltered urine. If there be only a trace of albumen, twenty or thirty minutes elapse before the opalescent zone becomes visible." Cautions!—" In concentrated urines, and especially in febrile urines, the addition of the acid is apt to precipitate the amorphous urates, and thus to occasion a turbidity which might be mistaken for albumen." " Albumen begins to coagulate immediately above the stratum of acid, and the turbidity spreads upwards ; but the urates first appear at or near the surface of the urine, and the opacity spreads downwards. Heat also readily resolves the doubt; for urates speedily disappear when the urine is warmed, but turbidity from albumen is not affected by heat." Nitric acid may increase the opalescence commonly present in the urine of patients who are taking cubebs and copaiba. When excess of urea is present in the urine, nitric acid produces a cr>-stallme deposit of nitrate of urea after the fluids have been some time in contact. Too small a quantity of nitric acid will fail to coagulate the albumen: a large quantity, if mixed with the urine, will re-dissolve it. (b.) Sugar—(a) Moore's Test [Boiling with Liquor Potasses).— Add to the suspected urine an equal quantity of liquor potassjE, and boil m a test-tube. If sugar (more than gr. per ounce) be present, the mixture will be darkened and afterwards turned of a reddish-brown colour. This is an easy though rough method, but is open to fallacy in high-coloured and in albuminous urines, and where the liquor potassK becomes vitiated by the presence of lead from the glass bottles, as in these cases a darkening, independent of sugar, (P) By the Reduction of Oxide of Copper [with Fehlino's According to Roberts, this is the best method of detecting sugar in urine.

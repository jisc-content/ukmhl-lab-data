When fracture is diagnosed or well marked, and the fragments readily retained, a split hand- kerchief (as in Fig. 123) may be applied over a guttapercha or pasteboard chin-cap (Fig. 122). After-treatment is similar to that in fracture of the upper jaw. In more difficult cases, the use of interdental vulcanite splints, with aperture for feeding, can be adapted ■with the aid of the dentist. Immediate wiring of the fragments (not adjacent teeth) has been advocated, and carried out with much success. Use of Antiseptics.—Ix^ all fractures of the facial bones where mucous cavities are involved, marked benefit attends the use of antiseptic washes. Warm water, having Condy's fluid or chlorate of potash added to it, may be used with a syphon, and frequent irrigation in this fashion gives the patient much comfort and prevents fcetor. A continuous purulent discharge denotes a local necrosis of bone, which requires removal as soon as it is loose. CHAPTER XVII. DISLOCATIONS, SPRAINS, AND BRUISES.

Dislocations—Diagnosis.—It is obvious that the methods adopted to discover the existence of fracture are equally serviceable in the case of dislocation. As fractures are characterised by preternatural mobility at a part of a bone which is normally rigid, so disloca- tions show preternatural fixation of a movable joint, along with an abnormal relation of certain associated bony structures. Naturally, the exceptions to this generahsation are many; and—more especially when we deal with impacted iractures in the vicinity of joints—there is sometimes a degree of doubt, only to be cleared away by careful observation. General Treatment.—The behaviour of dislocations after reduction varies much. Where the adjacent bone-surfaces embrace each other closely, or are held in apposition by strong muscles or ligaments which remain intact, the tendency to redisplacement is not well marked; whereas, if the opposing surfaces be small and shallow, and the uniting ligaments be greatly destroyed, the slightest motion will bring about the dislocation afresh. This is well seen if

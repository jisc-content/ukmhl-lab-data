241a PLASTER- CASTING. be an elastic cast of what is wanted. When placed upon its plaster of Paris backing, it will preserve the shape which it had while in the mould. (5) To Paint the Cast as required.—\Jse water-colours when a dry surface is to be imitated, oil-colours when the surface has to appear moist. The water-colour may require several coats. Finally, arrange an edging of black velveteen or other material to hide the iiregular margins and give a finish. —The advantages of this method of casting are its likeness m appearance and texture to flesh, and the great number of copies which may be taken from the same first mould. The disadvantages are, the possibility that it will not keep really good for more than eight or ten years, and the greater time required to make a cast in this than in plaster of Paris. Price.—The cost of the materials amounts to about is. 6d. per lb. of the mixture. Clay which remains always moist and ready for use may be made by mi.xing powdered pipe-clay with glycerine instead of with water. It should be kept in a damp place.

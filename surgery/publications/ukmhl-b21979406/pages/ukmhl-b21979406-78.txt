This, known as Hicks' method w^s ntroduced by J. M. Cotterill into Edinburgh, where it has blen largely and successfully used. c c u nas oeen abS'll/ nozzle is being tied into the vein of the recipient as fs nnniiS . °^ S'^" P'^'^P"^^ venesection. A bandage is applied to the upper arm to restrict the venous return. The skin pver_ the median basilic is cleansed and purified, and an obhque incision IS made through it into the vein. The blood which flows is caught and rapidly stirred in a vessel containing the warm phosphate of soda solution, of which the quantity required has been fixed belorehand._ To prevent the mixture from cooHng, the vessel containing it should be kept floating in a basin of hot water. A glass syringe holding 8 to lo ounces should be made ready by purilymg It with corrosive or other antiseptic lotion, and then washing It out with hot boiled water. Apiece of india-rubber tubing similarly cleansed, S or 6 inches long, should be used to connect It with the nozzle in the vein. While still hot, the syringe should be wrapped in a hot towel, and filled with the blood mixture. The blood of the receiver having been allowed to flow back so as to displace air in the glass nozzle, the latter should be attached by the india-rubber tubing to the syringe. Air in the syringe may either be displaced, or it may be kept from entering the veins by injecting with the handle-part of the syringe raised, and the injection stopped before the air is expelled. The syringe may be refilled as often as required (Fig. 28). John Duncan, in cases of injury, has modified the process of transfusion by remfusing the blood, which escapes from the patient's own hmb when the bruised and lorn tissues are divided. This, in bad cases, is caught, and mixed with the phosphate of soda solution,

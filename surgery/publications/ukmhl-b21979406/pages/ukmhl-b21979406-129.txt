108 ON BANDAGING. flat throughout. A series of figure-of-eight turns, horizonlal and oblique in direction, as shown in Figs. 54a and 54/^, are employed. It will be noted that the vertical turns loop in front of and behind the respective ears. Should the shape of the skull prevent the application of such a bandage, or if it be desirable to cover in the whole scalp, the capeline bandage or double-headed roller may be used as follows:— To Cover in the whole Fasten two rollers together as shown in Fig. 55. Let one be rather longer than the other. The larger roll should always circle round the head, the smaller should after the first turn travel backwards and forwards. The horizontal turns serve to fix the vertical, which form a divergent spica. Stand behind the patient with the larger roller in the left hand, the smaller in the right. Lay the bandage against the root of the nose, and carry the rollers horizontally directly backwards. Change hands at the occiput, and let the horizontal turn cover in the vertical one, which should now be carried forwards right over the nose, at the root of which it is fixed by the circling horizontal turn. The vertical turn is now carried back again to the occiput, slightly to one side of the middle line, and is once more fixed posteriorly by the horizontal turn —and so on. Care must be taken not to diverge too rapidly, and to come well down to the glabella in front and below the occiput behind at every turn. In this way, a most firm and secure bandage is obtained, which defies every attempt to take it down. It is, however, somewhat heating, and the superimposed circling turns are rather constricting, and apt to induce headache. Gauze bandages do not give rise to this objection.

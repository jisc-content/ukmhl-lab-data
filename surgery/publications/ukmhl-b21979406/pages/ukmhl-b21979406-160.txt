(f.) Fracture of the Femur in Children.—It is notevforthy, as stated before, that in children fractures of the femur are more frequently met with than fractures of the leg- bones; they are usually more or less transverse. Children are not easily kept quiet or dry, and therefore treatment is complicated by two con- ditions, unrest and mois- ture. We meet these difficulties by using the double long splint, or vertical extension (Figs. 109 and no). The Fig. 109,-Double Long Splint. double long splint is, moreover, well suited for restless adults and in cases of ununited fracture. It may be used with or without exten- sion. (3) Fractures of the Patella are in most respects comparable with fractures of the ole- cranon. In transverse fractures, there is marked separation of the frag- ments. The upper one is specially displaced by the action of the power- ful quadriceps extensor, and in addition by the filling of the synovial pores of the joint with exudations and blood- clot.

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE II—Continued. ganglion which is sometimes encountered in front of the artery. 5, 5, Borders of the fibrous sheath which separates the artery A from the nerve N, and from the vein V. A', The circum- flex artery of the ilium. A", The epigastric artery. A'", V, Artery and vein of the integu- ments. Fig. 11. The Femoral Artery above.—1, 1, 1, Contour of the wound. 2, 2, The first layer of the aponeurosis. 3, The border of the sartorius muscle. 4, The second layer of the aponeu- rosis, or the arterial sheath. A, The femoral artery, accompanied on its outside by the crural nerve N, on its inside by the vein of the same name V, and crossed by the saphena nerve N', and the internal saphena rein V enveloped in fat. Fig. 12. Tite femoral Artery below.—1, 1, 1, Contour of the wound. 2, The aponeurosis. 3, The sartorius pushed back to the outside. 4, The deep-seated aponeurosis, furnishing a sheath to the artery A, the femoral vein V, and the crural nerve N, on its inner side. A', The great anastomosing artery, which proceeds to ramify itself into the tendon of the adductor mag- nus muscle. Fig. 13.

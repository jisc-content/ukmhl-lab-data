PLATE XIX. INSTRUMENTS FOR LITHOTOMY. Fig. 1. A sound with an ebony handle, dilated in its curved portion, and having a button-like extremity, also with a wide [deep] groove upon it, like that of Dupuytren. Fig. 2. The lithotome which Cheselden employed in the beginning. Fig. 3. Pessary for the deviation of the neck of the womb. Fig. 4. Desormeaux's bilboquet pessary. Fig. 5. M. Tanchou's funnel-shaped pessary. Fig. 6. The elytroidal pessary. Fig. 7. Foubert's angulated knife for his lateral method. Fig. 8. The lithotome of F. Come, as modified by M. Charriere. The handle of this has nei- ther facettes (pans) nor numbers. We vary the degree to which its blade is opened, by advan- cing or drawing back the button which slides along the root of its bascule or movable piece, on the side of the instrument. Fig. 9. The double lithotome of Dupuytren, the opening of the blades of which may be gradu- ated and regulated in the same manner as in the last, and which lithotome has in various respects received important and ingenious modifications from the same cutler. Fig. 10. M. Roux's gorget, scarcely differing from that of Scarpa. Figs. 11 and 12. A male and female dilator, as formerly used in the great operation. Fig. 13. M. Charriere's tenacula, (tenettes.) They are so constructed that in opening them to the greatest extent possible, they never make but a slight separation between the branches of their handle in the wound. Fig. 14. Guerin's sound, a, its vesical and grooved portion, almost straight, a', the portion which, being united at/, to the corresponding upright branch, 6, terminates in the head, c. d, a trochar which passes through the head, c, and at the perineum, falls at e, on the groove a, of the sound. Fig. 15. Pessary in figure of 8. Fig. 16. The bondon or bung pessary. Fig. 17. The gimblet pessary. Fig. 18. The funnel pessary (see fig. 5) seen at its lower end.

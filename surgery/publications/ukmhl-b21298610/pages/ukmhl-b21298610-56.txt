PLATE XII. I. STAPHYLORAPHY. Fig. 1. The lips of the division a, «, have been excised, (avivees.) The three threads or sutures have been introduced. Their extremities 6, b, hang out of the mouth, and their nooses are a little depressed towards the pharynx. Nothing more is to be done than to knot them, and thus close up the fissure. Fig. 2. Angular scissors of M. Roux for commencing the excision of the fissure. Fig. 3. Blunt-pointed bistoury, suitable for continuing from below upwards the incision begun near the uvula with the scissors. Fig. 4. The needle-holder preferred by M. Roux. Its branches a, «, open in drawing upon the ring &, by means of the stem c, which traverses the handle,/, and by means of the button d. On the contrary, the branches are compressed together, and solidly hold the needle e, when we act upon this instrument in an opposite direction. Fig. 5. The same needle by itself Fig. 6. A needle used by M. Alcock at London in 1822. Fig. 7. Needle of M. Ebel. Fig. 8. Needle of M. Graefe, seen on its edge. Fig. 9. The same, seen on its face. Fig. 10. Another needle of the same author. Fig. 11, The needle-holding forceps of M. Sotteau. Fig. 12. Needle and needle-holder of M. Schwerdt, bent at an angle like the preceding. It is in other respects so constructed, that by pressing on the lateral stem 6, its point a is opened, by means of the flexion of the spring c, which is thus brought near to the handle d. Fig. 13. New needle-holder of M. Bourgougnon. • Fig. 14. Forceps of Graefe or Ebel. Fig. 15. Uranotome of Dieffenbach. Fig. 16. Knot-tightener of Graefe. While with one hand we draw upon tlie noose a, by its two branches 6, 6, the instrument, held by its handle, is pushed forwards with the other hand. Fig. 17. The same instrument seen on its side. Fig. 18. Needle and needle-holder of M. Doniges, curved, pierced, mounted on a handle, and strongly bent at an angle upon its handle. Fig. 19. Principal needle-holder of M. Bourgougnon. Fig. 20. A knot-tightener, whose gutter (or groove) 6, changes into a canal at its two extre- mities a, a. Fig. 21. The knot-tightener of Desault, with its head a bent to an angle, and its plate h cleft. Fig. 22. Another knot-tightener, which receives the ligature by its orifice a, and fixes it by means of its winch b. Fig. 23. Polypus-forceps of M. Charriere. They are slender, elastic, and also exceedingly strong from their peculiar tempering, and crossed in such manner as to occupy but very little space in the opening of the nostrils. Fig. 24. The chaplet knot-tightener of M. Mayor, a, A noose of thread passed into the piece 6, and through the small balls c, c, the two branches rf, d^ of which thread, reunited in the cylinder e, are fixed upon the winch / g. II. POLYPI.

PLATE XV. Figs. 4 and 5. Canulas for the trachea. (See Plate XIII.) THE OPERATIONS FOR HERNIA. Fig. 1. Inguinal Hernia.—Tlie right side.—(See Vol. III.)—The skin and subjacent tissues, o, a, which have been freely incised, are strongly pushed aside by the hands h, h, of the assistant, who draws aside, in the same manner, the sac b, b. With his left hand / the surgeon glides Pott's bistoury e under the upper and outer angle of the ring, in order to incise upwards and outwards. The forefinger c of the right hand d, which supports the back of the instrument, is at the same time made to depress the intestines g, g. On the left side it would be the right hand which would conduct the bistoury, and the left forefinger which would push back the intestines. Fig. 2. Crural Hernia.— The right side.—(See Vol. III.)—The hernial envelopes a, a, having been divided in the direction of the fold of the groin, are drawn to the inner side by the hand h of an assistant, who depresses, in a contrary direction, the intestines g with his other hand i. The cutting edge b of the bistoury c, held in the right hand d, in a direction almost horizontal, is placed upon the concave border of Gimbernat's ligament, which border it incises from without inwards, and slightly from above downwards. The forefinger e of the hand / pushes the intes- tines aside, and accommodates itself to the action of the instrument. Fig. 3. The enterotome of Delpech.

PLATE XYIII. LITHOTRITY.â€”DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. INSTRUMENTS OF DUCAMP. Fig. 5. The apparatus open, a, a, The graduated gum-elastic conductor. Its vesical extremity is provided with a platina socket 6, and its other end is fixed in a silver tube c. The cuvette e of the caustic-holder, pushed out of its conductor by the head of the forceps d. Represents the instrument shut up. The porte-caustic of Ducamp, w^hich is still preferred by M. Pasquier, is of metal only near the ring and near the cuvette. A gum-elastic bougie constitutes its middle portion. In fig. 8, we see the exploring bougie a, provided at b with moulding wax, fixed on the portion of the instrument not graduated. Fig. 1. The blunt-pointed stylette working in a catheter of gum-elastic, and designed for measuring the length of the contraction of the urethra, as had been already proposed by M. Bell and M. Van Welsnaer, for penetrating into the bladder in difficult cases. This stylette has been eulogized by M. Segalas, INSTRUMENTS OF M. LALLEMAND. Fig. 13. A portion of the porte-caustic sound isolated. Fig. 12. The instrument complete and open, a, a, The sheath, made of platina and provided with its running ring, b, The button, which may be removed at pleasure, and which allows of our pushing out or drawing in the button-cuvette d of the porte-nitrate. c, a small ball armed with a pressure-screw to graduate the movements of the central stem. Figs. 19 and 21. The articulated mandrin of M. Tanchou, for straightening out the urethra and depressing the prostate. In fig. 21, it is seen on its side, while in fig. 19 we have its dorsal or concave face. Fig. 14. A conical, dilated, emplastic bougie. Fig. 15. A gum-elastic conical bougie, which is not dilated. Figs. 18 and 20. Forceps for extracting small calculi from the urethra, or even from the blad- der. We push it in shut up, as in fig. 20, by means of the ring, a. When it is open [as in fig. 18] and we wish to shut it up, all we have to do is, to draw back its root, 6, into the canula, c, c. Fig. 16. The forceps-head (seen edgewise) of the same part, seen [obliquely] at d, fig. 5. Fig. 17. The antero-posterior porte-caustic of M. Leroy. Fig. 2. The curved scarificator with one blade only, otherwise called the simple uretrotome of M. Ricord. Fig. 10. M. Tanchou's conical dilated scarificator, with three or four cutting blades. Fig. 11. M. Stafford's scarificator, with a lancet-shaped head and point. Fig. 3. The lentil-head explorer or bridle-cutter of M. Leroy. Fig. 4. M. Barre's instrument for cauterizing from before backwards. Fig. 7. A porte-caustic isolated from its sound, fig. 17. Fig. 6. M. Leroy's button-headed stylette, made of twisted silver wire. Fig. 9. An articulated scoop armed with a stylette, having a head to fix and extract calculi from the urethra, according to the process laid down by M. Bonnet, of Lyons.

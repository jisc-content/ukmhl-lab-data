PLATE X. Figs. 29, 30. Needle of M. Gerdy, for the depression of the cataract. FISTULA LACHRYMALIS. Fig. 1. This figure represents the first stage of the operation. The surgeon, with his right hand, c, withdraws the bistoury e from the wound g, while with his left hand, rf, he inserts the canula by means of the stylet/ An assistant, stationed behind, steadies the external palpe- bral angle h with his left hand 6, and with his right hand a supports the forehead of the patient. The whole process should be conducted in such manner that the canula shall penetrate in pro- portion as the bistoury is being withdrawn in the same direction in which it entered, and that it should also glide rather upon the back or posterior part of the blade of the bistoury than upon its anterior portion.

Lecat's sound, which is introduced through the nose, and the beak of which, having an eye, receives the thread in the ocular angle, in order to draw from above downwards the di- lating meche, into the nasal canal. Fig. 21. The canula of Foubert, such as it has been preserved in the cabinets of the Faculty. There exists in the museum of the School of Medicine a golden one, which has a bourrelet on its upper part, and has much more resemblance than the preceding to that of Dupuytren. Fig. 22. Another canula of the same kind, but straight and much smaller. Fig. 23. The perforator of M. Montain. Fig. 24. A canula of the natural size, with a bourrelet or rim at its upper part. Fig. 25.

PART IV. CHAPTER I. OF CHANCRE. I HAVE been hitherto speaking of the effects of this poison when ap- plied to a secreting surface, and without a cuticle; of the intention of Nature in producing these effects; and of all the consequences, both real and supposed. I now mean to explain its effects when applied to a surface that is covered with a common cuticle, as the common skin of the body, which on such a surface will be found to be very different from those I have been describing. But I may be allowed here to remark, that the penis, the common seat of a chancre, is, like every part of the body, liable to diseases of the ulcerative kind, and from some circum- stances, rather more so than other parts, for if attention is not paid to cleanliness, we have often excoriations, or superficial ulcers, from that cause; also, like almost every other part that has been injured, these parts, when once they have suffered from the venereal disease, are very liable to ulcerate anew. Since then this part is not exempted from the common diseases of the body, and as every disease in this part is sus- pected to be venereal, great attention is to be paid in forming our judge- ment of ulcers here. Venereal ulcers commonly have one character, which however is not entirely peculiar to them, for many sores that have no disposition to heal (which is the case with a chancre,) have so far the same character. A chancre has commonly a thickened base, and although in some the common inflammation spreads much further, yet the specific is confined to this base. The future or consequent ulcers are commonly easily di- stinguished from the original, or venereal, which will be described here- after. It is an invariable effect, that when any part of an animal is irritated to a certain degree, it inflames and forms matter, the intention of which is to remove the irritating cause. This process is easily effected when it is on a surface whose nature is to secrete, but when on a surface

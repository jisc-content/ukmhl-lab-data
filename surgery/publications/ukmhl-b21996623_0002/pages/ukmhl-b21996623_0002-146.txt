It is probable that he would have so ascertained the laws which re- gulate the peculiar action of the venereal virus, as to have left no room for confounding its effects with dis- eases from other causes. It is probable that he would have explained the apparent contradictions in the effect of remedies, and, by appropriating each to its peculiar class of affections, have rendered the system of treat- ment no longer dubious and empirical, but clear and intelligible. It is certain that he would have opened the way for subsequent discoveries to an extent which cannot be calculated, and that, not only in the disease under consideration, but also in other maladies which have hitherto been little studied by pathologists, espe- cially in eruptions and other diseases of the skin. That such a task as this was well adapted to the powers of John Hunter cannot be questioned. The descriptions he has given in the work before us are suf- ficient of themselves to establish his reputation. In accuracy and distinctness they have never been sur- passed, and they remain at the end of half a century the standard definitions to which all subsequent writers have referred. But the plan here sketched out would have been toilsome and long. It would have required the labour of a life. The fruit which it promised was

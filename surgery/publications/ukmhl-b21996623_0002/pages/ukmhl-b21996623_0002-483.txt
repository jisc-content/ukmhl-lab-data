OF THE LUES VENEREA. 465 Oils, rubbed on a dry part, stick to it and prevent anything that is watery from coining in contact with it; and, as the venereal poison is mixed with a watery fluid, it is not allowed to touch the part. Everything which has a power of mixing with the venereal matter, and removing it from the part to which it is applied, may prove a pre- vention. Caustic alkali is the best for this purpose : it unites with the matter, forming a soap, and is then easily washed off. It is possible this union with the alkali may destroy the poison : the alkali must be much diluted, or it will excoriate. Lime-water would make a good wash. If both these methods were put in practice there would be still more security. Corrosive sublimate in water, about a grain or two to eight ounces, has been known to prevent the catching of the disease.

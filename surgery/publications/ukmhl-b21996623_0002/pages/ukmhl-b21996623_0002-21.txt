OF THE HUMAN TEETH 3 bent a little forward; is rounded, or convex, from the fore to the back part; and likewise a little rounded from one end to the other, or from right to left. Its external end is turned u little forward, and its inter- nal a little backward ; so that the axes of the two condyles are neither in the same straight line, nor parallel to each other; but the axis of each condyle, if continued backwards, would meet, and form an angle of about one hundred and forty-six degrees; and lines drawn from the symphysis of the chin to the middle of the condyle would intersect their longest axis at nearly right angles *. There are, however, some ex- ceptions, for in a lower jaw of which I have a drawing, the angle formed by the supposed continuation of the two axes, instead of being an angle of one hundred and forty-six degrees, is of one hundred and ten only. The lower jaw serves for a base to support the teeth in the alveolar process during their action on those of the upper jaw in mas tication, and to give origin to some muscles that belong to other parts. Of the Alveolar Processes. The alveolar processes are composed of two thin bony plates, one external! and the other internal J. These two plates are at a greater distance from each other at their posterior ends, than at the anterior, or middle part of the jaw. They are united together by thin bony parti- tions going across, which divide the processes at the anterior part into just as many distinct sockets as there are teeth ยง ; but at the posterior part, where the teeth have more than one root or fang, there are di- stinct cells or sockets for every rooty. These transverse partitions are more protuberant than the alveolar plates, and thus add laterally to the depth of the cells, particularly at the anterior part of the jaw. At each partition the external plate of the alveolar process is depressed, so as to form 'a fluting If round the cells or cavities for the roots of the teeth. This is observable in the whole length of the alveolar process of the upper jaw, and in the fore part particularly of the lower jaw. The alveolar processes of each jaw form about one half of a circular, or rather of an elliptical**, figure ; and at the fore part in the lower jaw they are perpendicular, but project inwards at the posterior part, and describe a smaller circle than the body of the bone upon which they standf-f, as we shall observe more particularly hereafter, when we come to treat of the jaws of old people. * PI.

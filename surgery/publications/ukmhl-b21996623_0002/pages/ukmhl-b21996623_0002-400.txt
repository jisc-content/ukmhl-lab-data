382 OF TIIE LUES VENEREA. It is most likely that contamination takes place about the beginning of the local complaints, especially when that is a chancre ; for there is in most cases less chance of its happening afterwards, because the pa- tient commonly flies to medicine, which generally becomes a prevention of contamination. For if it could take place through the whole time of the cure, we should have the parts contaminated at different periods, coming into action at different times, each according to its stated time, although in similar parts both in their nature and other circumstances; but as these similar parts do not vary much in the time of coming into action, it is reasonable to suppose that they were contaminated at or near the same time, and therefore that no contamination takes place in the time of the cure, although we may suppose that the power of ab- sorption is equally strong then as at any other time. In cases of contamination from a gonorrhoea, where no mercury has been taken, we might expect this irregularity in similar structures; but as contamination so seldom takes place in this way, we have not a chance of great variety from such; however, it would be worth while to ascer- tain the matter, which from a great many cases might be done. Without being very exact in ascertaining the different proportions in those who have the lues venerea originating from the three several modes above described, I think we may venture to say, from general practice or experience, that where one contracts it from the first cause, that is, where no local effects have been produced, a hundred have it from the second, or gonorrhoea; and where one has it from the second, a hun- dred have it from the third, or chancre; and perhaps not one in five hundred who have connexion with venereal women have it in the first way, and not one in a hundred have it from the second; while not one in a hundred would escape it from the third, if the means of prevention were not made use of in the common method of cure of the chancre. ยง.l. Of the Nature of the Sores or Ulcers proceeding from the Lues Venerea. In consequence of the blood being contaminated with real venereal pus, it might naturally be supposed that the local effects arising there- from would be the same with the original which produced them ; but from observation and experiment I have reason to believe that this is not so. In considering this subject, we may first observe that local effects, from the constitution, are all of one species, that is, ulcers, let the sur- face upon which the}7 appear be what it will, whether the throat 01 common skin, which is not the case in the local application of the mat-

322 OF CHANCRE. §. 1. Of the Phimosis and. Paraphimosis. These diseases arise from a thickening of the cellular membrane of the prepuce, in consequence of an irritation capable of producing con- nereal infection is essentially induration passing afterwards into ulceration In the earliest stage of the existence of a chancre this sequence is least discermb e, here be! g frequently at that period superficial and incipient ulceraUon with very little apparen thickening. But in the progress of the disorder the two stages become >n general very clearly distinguishable. If the sore be watched, it will be found that the tlncken- ngVecomes daily more distinct and extensive, till the ulcer assumes the true venereal appearance of a sore situated on an indurated base.

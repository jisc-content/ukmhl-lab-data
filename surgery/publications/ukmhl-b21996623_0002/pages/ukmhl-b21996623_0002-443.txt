425 OF THE LUES VENEREA. chancre have entirely disappeared, in general the patient may look upon himself as cured of them; but this is not the case in the lues venerea. A lues venerea is the effects of the poison having circulated in the blood till it has irritated parts so as to give them a venereal disposition, which parts sooner or later assume the venereal action, acqording to the order of their susceptibility. When the venereal matter is circulating I have supposed that certain parts are irritated by it, and that a vast number of other parts escape, as is evidently the case with the chancre; for in the case of a chancre the whole glans, prepuce, and skin of the penis ha^e had the matter applied to them, yet only one or more points are contaminated or irri- tated by it, all the others escaping; and we often see in the lues vene- rea, that when the parts contaminated assume the action, it is confined to them without affecting other parts, although the disease be allowed to go on for a considerable time without any attempt to a cure; and also, if these parts are imperfectly cured, the disease returns only in them; therefore these effects, although arising from the constitution, are in themselves entirely local, similar to the gonorrhoea and chancre, and like them may be cured locally; and the person may still continue to have the lues venerea, although not in these, yet in other parts, be- cause there may be many other parts in the same body that are under the venereal disposition, although they may not yet have assumed the venereal action. To cure the local and visible effects of the disease we must attack it through that medium by which it was communicated, that is, the blood ; without, however, considering the blood itself as dis- eased, or containing the poison, but as the vehicle of our medicine which will be carried by it to every part of the body where the poisoD was carried, and in its course it will act upon the diseased solids. This practice must be continued some time after all symptoms have disap- peared ; for the venereal action may to appearance be stopped, and symptoms disappear, and yet all return again, the venereal action not being completely destroyed. If the medicine were also a cure for the disposition in the parts second in order, and could prevent their coming into action, it would be necessary to continue it somewhat longer on their account; but this is not the case, for the visible effects, symptoms, or appearances in the first order of parts, give way to the treatment, while the parts that have only acquired the disposition, and are still in- active, afterwards assume the action and continue the disease. This deceives the surgeon, and leaves the groundwork for a second set of local effects in the parts second in order; but I have asserted that what will cure an action will not cure a disposition ; if so, we should push our medicine no further than the cure of the visible effects of the poison,

Whatever errors, however, may have crept into this work from the causes already alluded to, it forms the basis of all that has since been done to improve the knowledge of this branch of practice, and still more remarkably has it proved the foundation of all that is now known on the physiology of the teeth. It must, on the other hand, be conceded to his immediate follower Dr. Blake, that if he received from Hunter the hints from which his own discoveries were deduced, he has so clearly elucidated what in the former was obscure, so judiciously supplied what was deficient, and so sa- tisfactorily harmonized what appeared to be incompa- tible or inconsistent, that he well deserves the praise of having contributed more to the right understanding of the subject than any other writer that has ever treated on it either before or since ; and his inaugural dissertation (the work, it must be remembered, of a pupil,) contains opinions and statements on the struc- ture, the formation, the growth, and the relations of these organs, which most subsequent writers have done well to copy, and all experimental physiologists have only been able to confirm.

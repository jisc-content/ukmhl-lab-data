PART II. CHAPTER I. OF GONORRHOEA. When an irritating matter of any kind is applied to a secreting surface, it increases that secretion, and changes it from its natural state (what- ever that be) to some other. This, in the present disease, is pus. When this takes place in the urethra, it is called a gonorrhoea; and as it arises from the matter being applied to a non-cuticular surface, which naturally secretes some fluid, it is of no consequence in what part of the body this surface is; for if in the anus, it will produce a similar discharge there, and a similar effect on the inside of the mouth, nose, eyes, and ears. It is conceived by some that gonorrhoeas may take place without the above-mentioned immediate cause, that is, that they may arise from the constitution; if so, they must be similar to what is sup- posed to be a venereal ophthalmia. But, from the analogy of other ve- nereal affections proceeding from the constitution, I very much suspect the existence of either the one or the other; for when the poison is thrown upon the mouth, throat, or nose, it produces ulcers, and not an increased secretion like a gonorrhoea. But we never find an ulcer on the inside of the eyelids in those ophthalmia?; and gonorrhoeas in the urethra are too frequent to proceed from such a cause. Till about the year 1753, it was generally supposed that the matter from the urethra in a gonorrhoea arose from an ulcer or ulcers in that passage; but from observation it was then proved that this was not the case. It may not be improper to give here a short history of the discovery that matter may be formed by inflammation without ulceration. In the winter, 1749, a child was brought into the room used for dissection in Covent Garden; on opening of whose thorax a large quantity of pus was found loose in the cavity, with the surface of the lungs and the pleura furred over with a more solid substance, similar to coagulable lymph. On removing this from those surfaces, they were found entire.

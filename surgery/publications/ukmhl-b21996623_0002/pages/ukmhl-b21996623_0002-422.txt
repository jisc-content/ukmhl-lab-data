OF THE LUES VENEREA. 404 If this mode of accounting for these circumstances be just, it proves two things ; first, a former assertion, that this disease, in the form of lues venerea, has not the power of contaminating parts not already under its influence, even in the same constitution; secondly, that the venereal poison is not circulating in the blood all the time the disease is going on in the constitution; so that most probably the poison only irritates when just absorbed, and is soon expelled or thrown out in some of the secre- tions. The above account of the lues venerea may be reduced to the follow- ing heads: First, that most parts, if not all, that are affected in the lues venerea, are affected with the venereal irritation at the same time. Secondly, the parts exposed to cold are the first that admit the vene- real action; then the deeper-seated parts, according to their susceptibility for such action. Thirdly, the venereal disposition, when once formed in a part, must necessarily go on to form the venereal action. Fourthly, that all parts of the body, under such disposition, do not run into action equally fast, some requiring six or eight weeks, others as many months. Fifthly, in the parts, that come first into action, the disease goes on increasing without wearing itself out, while those that are second in time follow the same course. Sixthly, mercury hinders a disposition from forming, or, in other words, prevents contamination. Seventhly, mercury does not destroy a disposition already formed. Eighthly, mercury hinders the action from taking place, although the disposition be formed. Ninthly, mercury cures the action. These principles being established, the facts respecting the cure are easily accounted for.

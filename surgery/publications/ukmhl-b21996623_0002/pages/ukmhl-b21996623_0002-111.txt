This occasions so much uneasiness to the patient, that it becomes necessary to relieve the gum, if possible, by dividing it freely in several places, that it may shrink and leave this surface of the tooth wholly uncovered. If this does not answer, which is sometimes the case, it is advisable to draw the tooth. Sometimes, although but seldom, an inconvenience arises from the dentes sapientise being in the upper jaw and not in the lower; these teeth pressing upon the anterior part of the root of the coronoid pro- cess when the mouth is shut; for the coronoid processes are further forwards in such cases than when the lower jaw also has its dentes sapientiae ; in short, the exact correspondence between the two jaws is not kept up. In such cases, I know of no other remedy but the extraction of the tooth. Of Supernumerary Teeth. When there are supernumerary teeth*, it will in general be proper to have them drawn, for they are commonly either troublesome, or dis- figure the mouth. CHAPTER VIII. OF THE UNDER JAW. It is not uncommon to find the lower jaw projecting too far forwards, so that its fore teeth pass before those of the upper jaw when the mouth is shutf; which is attended with inconvenience, and disfigures the face. This deformity can be greatly mended in young people. The teeth in the lower jaw can be gradually pushed back, in those whose teeth are not close, while those in the upper can be gently brought forward; which is by much the easiest operation. These two effects are produced by the same mechanical powers.

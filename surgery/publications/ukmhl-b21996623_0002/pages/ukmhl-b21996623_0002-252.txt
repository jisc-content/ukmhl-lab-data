234 SUPPOSED CONSEQUENCES OF GONORRHOEA. ancl of the powers and composition of his bougies, as to create disgust. However, this absurdity has been much more effectual in introducing the bougie into universal use than all the real knowledge of that time, directed by good sense, could have been. Such extravagant recom- mendations of particular remedies are not at all times without their use. Inoculation would have still been practised with caution had it not been for the enthusiasm of the Suttons. Preparations of lead would not have been so universally applied if they had not been recommended by Gou- lard in the most extravagant terms; nor would the hemlock have come into such general use if its true merits only had been held forth. Im- provements are often over-rated, but they come to their true value at last. Sutton has told us, that the cold regimen, in extreme, is infi- nitely better than the old method; but from general practice we have learned that moderation is best, which is all we yet know. When Daran published his observations on the bougie, every surgeon set to work to discover the composition, and each conceived that he had found it out, from the bougies he had made producing the effects de- scribed by Daran. It never occurred to them that any extraneous body, of the same shape and consistence, would do the same thing. ยง. 2. Of the Treatment of the Permanent Stricture. The cure of the permanent stricture is, I believe, to be accomplished only by local applications. Mercury has been given, upon the erro- neous supposition of its being venereal, but without success. 'Phe cure is either a dilatation of the contracted part, or a destruction of it by ulceration, or escharotics. The dilatation is performed by the bougie, and this is seldom or never more than a temporary cure; for although the passage may be dilated sufficiently for the urine to pass, yet there is always the original tendency to contraction, which generally recurs sooner or later*. The ulcerative process is also effected by a bougie, and the destruction by escharotics is by means of caustics. It often โข In cases of stricture, when a patient applies for relief, it may often be proper to in- quire into the history of the case previous to the passing of a bougie, especially to inquire if he ever used bougies before; if he has, then to inquire into the result; if they passed readily, or if they did not pass the stricture at all: if the first, then nothing further need be asked; but if the last, then to inquire if he or his surgeon observed that they were gaining ground with the bougie, viz., if the bougie went further in before it was left off than at first; if so, then to ask hint how far. If they have visibly gained ground with- out getting through the stricture, I am afraid that the use of the bougie must not be pursued, because it is most probable that a new passage has been formed, which makes the passing of the bougie into the stricture impossible.

361 OF BUBO. reasons for this. I once suspected that the nature of the poison was altered in these glands as it passed through them, which was the reason why it did not contaminate the second or third series of glands; and also why it did not affect the constitution in the same way as it did the ]>arts to which it was first applied ; but this explanation will not account for the next order of glands to suppurating buboes not being affected by the absorption of venereal matter. It appears to me that the internal situation of the other glands prevents the venereal irritation from taking place in them; and this opinion is strengthened by observing when one of these external glands suppurates and forms a bubo, which is to be considered as a large venereal sore or chancre, that the absorption from it, which must be great, does not contaminate the lymphatics or glands next in order, by the venereal matter going directly through them. If this be true, then the skin would seem to be the cause of the sus- ceptibility of the absorbents to receive the irritation. Whether the skin has the power inherent in itself, or acquires it from some other circum- stance, as air, cold, or sense of touch, is not easily ascertained ; but whichever it be, it shows that the venereal matter of itself is not capa- ble of irritating, and that it requires a second principle to complete its full effect, that is, a combination of the nature of the poison and the influence of the skin, and that influence must be by sympathy, and therefore weaker than if acting in the same part, that is, the skin itself, which perhaps is the reason why the venereal matter does not always affect those vessels and glands, while it always does the skin, if inserted into it. The situation of buboes arising from the venereal disease in the penis is, in men, in the absorbent glands of the groin ; if a gonorrhoea is the cause of a bubo, one groin is not exempted more than the other; both may be affected : but if a bubo arises in consequence of a chancre, then the groin may be generally determined by the seat of the chancre, for if the chancre is on one side of the penis, then the bubo wrill commonly be on that side : however, this is not universally the case; for I have known instances, although but few, where a chancre on one side of the prepuce or penis has been the cause of a bubo on the opposite side, which, if arising from that chancre, is a proof that the absorbents either anastomose, or decussate each other. If the chancre be on the frsenum, or on the middle of the penis, between the two sides, then it is uncer- tain which side will be affected. The situation of the glands of the groin is not always the same, and therefore the course of the absorbent vessels will vary accordingly. I have seen a venereal bubo, which arose from a chancre on the penis, a considerable way down the thigh ; on the contrary, I have seen it often

Intestinal Surgery 4 gut, and it is undesirable that a movable piece of gut should be united to a fixed one, since the intestinal contractions in the movable portion of gut will cause this portion to pull upon the stitches when united to a fixed part. Thus the ileum should not be connected to the ascending or descending colon, but when it is necessary to unite it to a portion of the large intestine the union should be made with the transverse colon or the sigmoid. In the same way the only parts of the large intestine which should be united to each other are the transverse colon or the sigmoid. Again, the fixed duodenum should not be united to the movable stomach, but the movable jejunum should be employed in its place. III. When the knots of sutures are left on the peri- toneal surface of the gut, it is essential that the suture should not penetrate through all the coats of the gut, since there would then be a probability of infection of the peritoneum by absorption from the intestinal tract- It is quite a question whether the mere fact of the silk becoming infected by absorption of intestinal contents will lead to any bad effect ; the real danger lies in the fact that when once the suture has become infected it will have to separate, and it will do this in the direction of least resistance. When the knot is inside the bowel a little irritation is set up just round the suture, which effectually shuts off the peritoneal cavity, and then sufficient inflammation and ulceration are excited to cast off the suture within the cavity of the bowel, a very small tract being left after it has been discharged ; this, however, is sealed by peritoneal adhesion, and so gives rise to no trouble. When, however, the knot is outside, and the suture has become infected, it will have to separate in the

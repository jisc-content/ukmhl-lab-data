Intestinal Surgery 86 where it is impossible either to remove the growth or to anastomose the ileum to the sigmoid below the growth, and to cases of inoperable malignant disease of the pelvic viscera. It is, of course, sometimes performed as a temporary measure in the course of removal of a carcinoma of the colon or sigmoid. No mention need be made of the lumbar operation, since it has practically fallen into disuse. The main points in the inguinal operation are (i) to prevent infection of the abdominal wall, (2) to form a proper spur, so that the intestinal contents do not go on past the opening. The first point is effected by deferring the opening of the bowel for a few days after attaching it to the skin, or by conducting the faeces away from the wound by means of a Paul’s tube ; the second is brought about in a variety of ways—some surgeons pass a stitch through the mesosigmoid, and attach this to the abdominal wall, others pass a glass rod or piece of gauze through a hole in the mesosigmoid, etc. I will, however, describe the method which I have devised, and which I have now employed for some years. It absolutely insures that no faeces can pass into the lower part of the sigmoid, since the gut is completely divided, and there is a bridge of skin between the two openings. The operation is performed as follows : The incision in the abdominal wall is made in the usual position, but is slightly longer than in the other methods. After opening the peritoneal cavity, the loop of sigmoid is brought out of the wound, and a hole is torn in its mesosigmoid. The edges of the peritoneum on either side are then united together at the centre] of the wound inside the hole of the mesosigmoid wittf two silk mattress sutures ; this is easily done by passing the

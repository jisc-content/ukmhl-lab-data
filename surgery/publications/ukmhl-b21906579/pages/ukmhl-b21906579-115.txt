Special Operations 99 anus. In this operation a small sinus is left at the site of the artificial anus, which will continue to discharge a small amount of mucus for some time, but will not give rise to much trouble. It will contract to a pinhole in a short time. (3) In the third method the spur formed between the afferent and efferent portions of gut is divided by means of an enterotome, and the opening is closed at a subse- quent operation. The best-known enterotomes are Dupuytren’s and Mickulicz’s. A third one has recently been invented by Carwardine, which is a combination of the two. Fig. 82.—Dupuytren’s Enterotome. (Down Bros.) Dupuytren’s enterotome is shown in Fig. 82. It consists of two blades which take apart, and each is introduced separately into the afferent and efferent portions of the gut, and are then united at their joint, and the blades are brought together by tightening the screw. This should be done very carefully, and at first only sufficient pressure should be employed to keep the enterotome in place. If more pressure is used the enterotome would cut through the coats of the bowel too quickly and extravasation would take place. The screw of the enterotome is tightened ] one half-turn every day, and the instrument will be found to"! have cut through by 7—2

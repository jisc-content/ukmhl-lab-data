48 Intestinal Surgery tucked inside the lumen of the gut. The needle of the continuous Lembert is then taken up again, and this stitch carried all round the anastomosis just outside the former suture ; it is then tied to the end left at its com- mencement. The anastomosis will then be complete. This method, though difficult, should be practised, as it is the one employed when using bone bobbins, and it is desirable to be able to perform the simple suture before resorting to the aid of apparatus. Anastomosis by Suture + Apparatus These methods, again, we may divide into those where there is only a single row of sutures, and those where there are two rows. A single row of sutures includes (i) O’Hara’s clamp Fig. 48.—O’Hara’s Clamp Forceps. (Down Bros.) The two clamps are fastened together by the spring clip. forceps, (2) Laplace’s forceps, and (3) Halsted’s rubber bag. 1. O’Hara’s Clamp Forceps consist of two pairs of bow-shaped intestinal clamps, about 4 inches long, which are united together with a clip. This is shown in Fig. 48. They can be used for either lateral or end-to-end anastomoses. In end-to-end anastomosis they are applied as follows :

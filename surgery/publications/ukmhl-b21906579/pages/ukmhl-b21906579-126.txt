1 IO Intestinal Surgery- outer edge of the right rectus, and, after dividing the aponeurosis of the external oblique, the fibres of the in- ternal oblique and of the transversalis muscle should be divided in the direction of the wound, and the peritoneum opened. Pus will then well out ; this should be washed away with sterilized saline solution, and the appendix searched for ; it will usually be found to be gangrenous or perforated. It must be gently lifted into the wound, and its mesentery ligatured. No time should be wasted in forming a cuff of peritoneum, but an incision should be made through the peritoneal coat round the appendix about \ inch from the caecum, and the rest of the coats ligatured with a silk thread. The appendix is then clamped on the distal side of the ligature, and is cut off. A couple of Halsted’s or Lembert’s sutures are inserted close to the caecum to invaginate the end of the appendix. A counter opening must now be made in the middle line above the pubes, and a very large drainage-tube inserted into the pelvis ; another drainage-tube is inserted into the first incision, and the abdomen is thoroughly flushed out with saline solution. A gauze-drain is inserted close to the drainage-tube in the lateral incision, and the rest of the wound closed with silkworm-gut sutures. The drainage-tubes should be sutured in position. The operation should be performed as rapidly as possible, and shock avoided by means mentioned on p. 136. Although the removal of the appendix increases the length of the operation and the shock, it is practically necessary, since recovery is unlikely if a gangrenous or perforated appendix be left behind. If the symptoms of general peritonitis do not specially point to the appendix, the abdomen should be first opened in the middle line below the umbilicus, and then, on examination of the caecal region, the appendix trouble

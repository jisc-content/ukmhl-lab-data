Special Operations 65 may to advantage be reinforced by the application of a piece of omentum over the site of the ulcer. In the case of a clean-cut wound, or of a rupture of a healthy stomach, the opening should be closed by a •double row of sutures, the first ones going through all the coats of the stomach, and the others taking up the serous and muscular coats only. Continuous sutures should not be employed, on account of the puckering of the stomach walls which would be caused. 2. Gastro - Enterostomy.—This operation is of great value, and when performed as an adjunct to suture of a gastric ulcer, it will aid the cicatrization of the sutured ulcer by preventing any distension of the stomach with flatus or food. The operation is also frequently per- formed with very beneficial results in cases of intract- able gastric ulcer and in old-standing chronic gastritis, in addition to cases of dilatation of the stomach due to organic obstruction at the pylorus. The organic obstruc- tion may be due to cicatricial contraction after ulcer, to adhesions from without, or, lastly, to malignant disease. There is a very great choice of methods of establish- ing a new opening out of the stomach. The old operation of gastro-duodenostomy is not to be recommended, on account of the fixed position of the duodenum, and it is now almost always the rule to attach the jejunum to the stomach. The first part of the jejunum can be readily found by turning up the great omentum and transverse colon, and feeling for a piece of gut just to the left of the first lumbar vertebra, as shown in Fig. 65 ; this is hooked out of the wound with the finger, and pulled upon until no more gut comes, showing that the beginning of the jejunum has been found. The coil of gut is then allowed to become slack, and a point about 6 to g inches from its commencement should be selected 5

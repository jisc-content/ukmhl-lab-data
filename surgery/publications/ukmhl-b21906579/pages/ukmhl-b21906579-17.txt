i INTESTINAL SURGERY CHAPTER I Section I GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS I. Anatomical Conditions.â€”The small intestine has four important coats, as shown in Fig. i. They vary in thickness and in toughness in different parts of the bowel. 1. The peritoneal coat does not completely surround the gut in any part of the intestine; there is always the portion of the circumference of the bowel at the attach- ment of the mesentery which is uncovered with peri- toneum. The extent of this uncovered area varies in different parts. It is smallest in the ileum, where only about one-tenth of the circumference is uncovered. In the duodenum, ascending and descending colons, the portion which is not covered with peritoneum is nearly one-half of the circumference, and in the transverse colon and sigmoid the uncovered area is about one-fifth of the whole. 2. The muscular layer is the thickest coat of the bowel, and consists of longitudinal and circular fibres. Although of considerable thickness, it is not, however, of great strength, and sutures which take a hold of this coat only

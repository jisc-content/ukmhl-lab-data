87 Special Operations needle first through the parietal peritoneum on one side, then passing the needle through the hole in the meso- sigmoid, and then picking up a portion of the opposite parietal peritoneum, and back through the hole in the mesosigmoid, and finally through the peritoneum close to the commencement of the suture. This is shown in Fig. 78. The second stitch is passed in a similar manner. Two silkworm-gut sutures are then inserted Fig. 78.â€”The Operation of Colotomy. (A. Baldwin.) The stitch has been passed to unite the peritoneum with the hole torn in the mesosigmoid. to unite the corresponding portions of skin within the rent in the mesosigmoid. When these sutures are tied the centre of the wound is united within the hole of the mesosigmoid, and the loop of sigmoid is prevented from slipping back. The only further stitches which are necessary are one at each angle of the wound passed between the bowel and the skin to prevent any more bowel becoming prolapsed. If the operation is done for acute obstruction, it will be necessary to make

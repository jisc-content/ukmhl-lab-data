105 Special Operations closed with two layers of sutures, and dropped back into the abdominal cavity. The proximal end of the gut, with the Paul’s tube in situ, is stitched to the parietal peritoneum by the insertion of three or four silk sutures. If the patient is in a sufficiently good condition after this stage of the operation to stand another half-hour’s anaesthetic, I immediately proceed to do a lateral anasto- mosis between the lower part of the ileum and the sigmoid, as described on p. 81. If the patient is suffering from shock after removal of the growth, the anastomosis may be deferred until a second operation, which should be performed about two or three weeks after the first. There is another way of re-establishing the intestinal canal after removal of the growth, which I have employed in two or three cases. After removing the loop of bowel outside the abdomen, a Paul’s tube is stitched into each end of the gut below and above the growth, and the pieces of gut going to and coming from the artificial anus are united along their convex border by four or five silk sutures after the growth has been removed. When the abdominal wound has healed and the Paul’s tubes have dropped out, a Dupuytren’s or, better, a Mickulicz’s enterotome is inserted, as described on p. 99. Before passing on to the consideration of cases accom- panied by acute obstruction, I would like to say one word with respect to prognosis. When an operation is per- formed in the early stages the shock is not great, and the risk of the operation is trifling ; moreover, the ultimate prognosis after complete removal of the growth and its mesocolon is very good, and even when recurrence does occur this is usually delayed for some years. The absence of a large intestine after ileo-sigmoidostomy seems to exercise no bad effect upon the digestion or nutrition of the patient.

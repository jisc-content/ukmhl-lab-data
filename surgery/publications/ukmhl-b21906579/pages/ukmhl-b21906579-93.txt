77 Special Operations Several other points of interrupted sutures going through all the coats of the stomach and duodenum are then inserted so as to completely close the opening. This supporting row of sutures is then covered in by a row of Halsted’s sutures introduced in the ordinary way. This operation is only applicable to fibrous strictures of the pylorus, and should never be done either in malig- nant disease or in cases where any active ulceration is present. It is open to the objection that, although the A row of Lembert’s sutures have been passed, and have converted the horizontal incision into a vertical one. actual pyloric opening is enlarged by the manoeuvre, it is apt to produce a kink at the pylorus, and, moreover, it is very liable to contract. A most important objection to its use lies in the fact that in a dilated stomach the pylorus is no longer the lowest point in the stomach, and so even if the pylorus be made patent the dilated stomach will not be able to empty itself, and the patient will suffer from the effects of decomposition of retained contents. In several cases in which I have employed this method

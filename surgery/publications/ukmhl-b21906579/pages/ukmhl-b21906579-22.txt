It is most important to have proper needles, since, if ordinary surgical needles with sharp sides be employed, there is a great risk of the delicate coats of the intestine being cut through if the needle be held at all slantingly. Both straight and curved needles should be at hand ; the straight needles are ordinary sewing-needles, which can be obtained from any haberdasher, and the most con- venient size is No. 8. It is convenient to have rather a longer needle than the sewing-needle, and such a one is called a straw needle. In order to use a small-size needle, I recommend that the open-ended or calyx-eyed needle should be obtained ; they save an infinite amount of trouble in threadingâ€”in fact, until I employed them, I used to find it impossible to thread No. 8 needles with

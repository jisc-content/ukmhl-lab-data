45 End-toEnd Anastomosis sutures are placed through all the coats, uniting them together, the knots being tied inside the bowel. This is shown in Fig. 44. All these sutures are cut short, including the one which acted as a guide. The two guides first inserted in the convex portions of the bowel are now again seized with forceps and held apart from those last passed close to the mesenteric attachment. Fig. 45.—End-to-End Anastomosis. The numbers refer to the same threads as in the preceding figures. Closure of the third side of the triangle by two layers of interrupted stitches, in the same way as described in Figs. 18 and 19. This is to show the line for the insertion of the sutures on the third side of the triangle. This portion of the anastomosis is completed in the way described before for the closure of a wound in the bowel—i.e., by a double row of sutures, one passing through all the coats, which are passed so that the knots are inside the lumen of the gut, and the other a row of Lembert’s. When these are inserted the two pairs of guides are withdrawn. The

63 CHAPTER IV SPECIAL OPERATIONS On the Stomach The operations which are most often called for are (i) suture of a ruptured gastric ulcer or of a wound of the stomach, and (2) gastro-enterostomy. 1. In suture of a gastric ulcer it is seldom advisable to attempt to excise the ulcer, as the surrounding walls of the stomach will be found to be infiltrated with inflam- matory products, and so a very large area would have to be removed in order to get to healthy tissues. The best method of closing a ruptured gastric ulcer is by means of a double row of Lembert’s or Halsted’s sutures, and the first row of these must be placed at some little distance, about ^ inch, from the ulcer ; it necessarily follows that the row must be continued for about £■ inch beyond the limit of the ulcer of each end ; this is shown in Fig. 63. In some cases these Lembert’s or Halsted’s sutures will be found to cut out as soon as an attempt is made to tie them. In such cases a purse-string suture should be passed round the ulcer at a distance of about 1 inch outside it. The stitch must penetrate the muscular and submucous coats. The ulcer is invaginated when the stitch is tied; this is shown in Fig. 64. The suture

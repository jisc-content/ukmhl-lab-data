Intestinal Surgery- 102 possible to get a sufficient length of healthy bowel below the seat of obstruction for the purpose of doing an anastomosis. We need only consider two methods : (1) The application of an enterotome, which is used in the same way as described for artificial anus of the small intestine ; this is more suitable for the large than for the small intestine, as it is more likely that a portion of the intestinal wall away from the mesentery (and therefore covered with peritoneum) will be included within the blades of the enterotome, and so no extravasation will take place. It is, however, only possible in cases of artificial anus left after removal of a growth where there is no obstruction beyond. I only employ it in cases of removal of growth of the sigmoid flexure, where there is little room left below for the performance of a lateral anastomosis, and where there would be a risk of regurgitation of the faecal contents through the artificial anus after such an anastomosis. (2) By far the best method of closing an artificial anus of the colon, however, is the performance of an ileo- sigmoidostomy, and this operation is possible in any case where the obstruction is situated above the lower third of the sigmoid. The artificial anus is carefully plugged and sewn up as described above, then an incision is made along the outer border of the left rectus muscle, and the ileum found and united to the sigmoid, as described on p. 81. When this operation is performed for the relief of an artificial anus it will always be necessary to occlude the ileum between the anastomosis and the caecum, as described on p. 27. It will not be necessary to do any- thing to the artificial anus itself, as this will shrivel up, and nothing but a minute pin-point orifice will be left.

Special Operations 73 the jejunum is then completely divided about 4 or 5 inches from the ligament of Treitz. The distal end of the jejunum is then implanted into the stomach by a double continuous suture, and the cut end of the proximal portion of the jejunum is then implanted into the convex border of the distal portion about 2 or 3 inches below the gastro-enterostomy; this is shown in Fig. 72. The operation completed. It will be readily understood that no vicious circle is possible; the principal danger beyond shock will be the subsequent contraction of the opening between the stomach and jejunum.

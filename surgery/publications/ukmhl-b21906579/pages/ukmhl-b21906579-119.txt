Special Operations 103 through which there is an occasional discharge of mucus. I have never had any troublesome discharge of faeces by regurgitation, except where the artificial anus was within an inch or so of the anastomosis. It is better not to attempt to absolutely close the end of the short-circuited large intestine, as there would be a danger of accumulation of mucus, and the risk of inflammation taking place in it. IV. The Treatment of Cancer of the Colon In acute obstruction the indication for operation is clear, and it is urgently called for to save life. In cases of suspected growth, where the symptoms are not at all acute, an exploratory operation should be performed. In the first place, I should like to protest emphatically against the formation of an artificial anus except as a temporary measure. I have often witnessed the dis- tressing condition of a patient after an artificial anus at the beginning of the colon, and I am inclined to think that death must be preferable to such a condition. The ideal operation, of course, is the removal of the growth, com- bined with an intestinal anastomosis ; this is possible in the case of any growth which is not too firmly adherent to neighbouring parts. I have myself excised a growth of the transverse colon to which was adherent a coil of ileum and the bladder, and portions of both of these viscera had to be removed ; and Pollard mentions a case where he had to excise a kidney which was infiltrated by a growth of the descending colon. Granted that the growth is sufficiently free to be removed, the simplest method, no doubt, is to excise it, and to unite the cut ends by an end-to-end anastomosis. There are, however, considerable objections to this procedure, since, except in the case of the sigmoid and the transverse colon, so much of the walls of the colon are uncovered by peri-

16 Intestinal Surgery no extravasation can take place. It is thp one which I employ on practically all occasions. II. Continuous.—These can be classified according to the coats of the bowel which are included in them, or according to their shape. r. The simplest form is the continuous Lembert, or Dupuytren’s suture, which is used in most cases where two rows of sutures are inserted. It is inserted in the same way as the simple Lembert, and care should be taken that the needle is made^to enter points in each edge opposite to each other. Fig. 12 shows this suture. The suture is commenced by passing an ordinary Lembert stitch, which Fig. 12.—Continuous Lembert or Dupuytren. (L. Mark.) is tied ; the end of the silk to which the needle is attached is then used for the continuous suture ; it is finished off by tying it to one of the ends of an ordinary Lembert suture which has been inserted just beyond the termina- tion of the continuous suture, or it may be finished off by not pulling the short end of the silk through the last stitch-holes, and then tying this short end to the loop on which the needle is threaded. It is essential, in passing the continuous suture, (1) to pull each stitch tight after passing it, and, (2) in order to prevent undue puckering when putting in the stitch, to oversew the suture every third or fourth stitch ; this is shown in Fig. 13.

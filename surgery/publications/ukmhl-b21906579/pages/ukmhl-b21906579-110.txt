Intestinal Surgery 94 be made to reduce the intussusception. The way to do this is to gently squeeze the portion of gut containing the apex of the intussusception, and to try and reduce this from below upwards. Great care is required not to cause damage to the walls of the gut, since it is not difficult to rupture the inflamed intestine if too much force be employed. On the other hand, some considerable amount of force is needed to reduce the oedema of the apex. The best way is to squeeze the whole tumour fairly firmly, and then to gently try to push it backwards. On no account must any attempt be made to reduce the intussusception by pulling on the intussusceptum, as this will certainly not succeed, and is a very dangerous proceeding, being often followed by rupture of the bowel. If the intussusception cannot be reduced by pressure and taxis the following methods may be employed : (i) An artificial anus may be made above the intussusception ; this, of course, would only be a temporary measure, and would require to be dosed by a subsequent operation. (2) An anastomosis maybe made between the portions of bowel coming to and going from the intussusception ; this would best be done by the Halstedâ€™s method for lateral anastomosis; although it is a serious measure when a patient is collapsed, it is not so severe as the next one. (3) An incision may be made in the convex border of the sheath away from the mesentery, exposing the whole intussuscepted portion ; this is turned out of the incision, and is transfixed close to its neck by two needles armed with stout silk sutures. The intussusception is then cut away just beyond these two sutures, and bleeding-points in the mesentery are ligatured. When the intussusception is cut away the two sutures will be seen running across the lumen of the invaginated bowel ; these sutures are then picked up with a blunt hook, and each is divided

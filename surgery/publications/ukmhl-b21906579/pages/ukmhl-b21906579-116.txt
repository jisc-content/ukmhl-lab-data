JOO Intestinal Surgery the fifth or sixth day, by which time firm peritoneal adhesions will have formed. We shall then have a free channel between the afferent and efferent loops of intestine, and the larger amount of faeces will go by the proper channel past the artificial anus. It will, how- ever, be necessary to complete the operation after an interval of a fortnight by closing the artificial anus. An incision is made around the edge of the artificial anus, Fig. 83.—Dupuytren’s Enterotome Applied and Dividing the Spur. and the mucous membrane is dissected up for about i to f inch all round. The edges of the mucous membrane are united by a row of sutures whose knots are inside the intestine, and by two or three rows of Lembert’s stitches passed through the outer coats. Lastly, the edges of skin are brought together with sutures. The greater part of the suturing will probably hold, but often a small faecal fistula is left, which, however, will gradually contract, and will not give rise to much trouble. Its closure may be hastened by touching it with a galvanic cautery.

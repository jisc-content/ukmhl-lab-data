Clamps 11 be inserted before the application, and in Halsted’s method the whole of the sutures are inserted before it is necessary to use a clamp. Secondly, they should be applied at some distance from the part to be sutured, at least 2 inches away. There are two reasons for this— (1) that the vessels close to the anastomoses should not be damaged by the clamp, and (2) that the walls of the gut should not be dragged out of position by the clamp. Thirdly, they should be taken off as soon as possible, and in cases where the anastomosis is effected by a Fig. 6.—Maunsell’s Sponge and Safety-pin Clamp. 1, Stricture of intestine ; 2, sponge ; 3, safety-pin passed through mesentery. double row of sutures the clamp may usually be removed with safety when the first row has been completed. Lastly, there is no clamp so good as an assistant’s fingers ; but if the operation is prolonged this is apt to be trying for him. In Halsted’s anastomosis I do not think a clamp is necessary, since the sutures are all passed before the bowel is opened, and as the anastomosis is

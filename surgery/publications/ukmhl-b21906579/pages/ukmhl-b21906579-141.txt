Incisions into the Abdomen 123 tinuous sutures in the union of these layers of the sheath, as, if one thread of a continuous suture should ultimately cut out, the whole of the suture would become loose. In the same way, should any infection occur in the wound, it would remain local in the case of an interrupted suture, but would spread along the whole length of the wound in the case of a continuous one. The skin incision should be accurately brought together with a few points of silkworm-gut suture, or a continuous suture may here be employed. The appearance of the wound when sutured is shown in Fig. 91. The wound is then dressed as described in Chapter X., p. 144. Fig. 01.â€”The Appearance of an Incision through the Rectus Sheath when closed. (A. Baldwin.; This is the general principle on which to make and to close an opening into the abdomen. In the case of an operation for the removal of a portion of intestine or of another organ, it is absolutely essential that the wound should be a free one, and in the case of cancer one must not hesitate to divide the muscles transversely, so as to get enough room, since insufficient room will probably mean incomplete removal of the disease. I have already re- ferred to the necessity, in cases of abscess of the appendix, for the transverse division of muscle so as to insure proper drainage. The same indication will apply to other intra- abdominal abscesses, such as those in connection with the

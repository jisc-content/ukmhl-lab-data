Special Operations 93 In some cases of internal strangulation the bowel may become torn even when it is not gangrenous, and in these cases it is quite useless to suture the rent in the bowel. The whole constricted loop and healthy bowel on each side must be excised if the patient can stand the shock ; if not, the knuckle of gut must be stitched to the angle of the wound, and a Paulâ€™s tube tied in. II. Operative Treatment of Intussusception If the intussusception has existed for more than twelve hours it is very unlikely that it can be reduced without an operation, but an attempt may be made to reduce it by means of injection, if the case is seen very early. In using injections it must be remembered that the capacity of the colon in infants is not more than about io ounces, and in a child of three or four years it will be from i to 2 pints. In giving an injection, too, no force must be used, and it is better to give it entirely by gravity, using a funnel, which is raised only a few feet from the bed ; a syringe is not suitable, as it is difficult to control the force of the stream. The best fluid to use is milk-and- water, as this will become partially absorbed, and so diminish shock. If the intussusception is not reduced immediately by these means the abdomen must be opened, preferably over the seat of the swelling. The intestines must be pushed on one side in order to obtain a view of the tumour, as this must be seen before any attempt is made to reduce it, since any reduction of a gangrenous intussusception would be certainly fatal. If the bowel appears fairly healthy, and there is no lymph about the neck of the intussusception, and so the parts may be considered not to be firmly adherent, an attempt should

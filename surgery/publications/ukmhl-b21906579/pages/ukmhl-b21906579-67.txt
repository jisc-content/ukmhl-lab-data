EncUtoEnd Anastomosis 51 ends of the two portions of gut are clamped. Each half of the forceps consists of a semicircular clamp, and they are connected together by a spring clip. In end-to-end anastomosis they are used as follows : The two cut ends of intestine are first united by four fixation stitches passed through all the coats at the four cardinal points—i.e., the mesenteric and convex borders and midway between these on each side. This insures the exact apposition of the mesentery of the two ends. The two halves of the forceps are next introduced separ- ately between two of the sutures, and are then connected together with the clip. The forceps, which now form a complete ring, are opened so that one ring blade is in each end of the gut. The serous surfaces are inverted and drawn between the blades. This is facilitated by passing a ligature round the ends ; the forceps are then clamped, when serous membrane should be in apposition to serous membrane. The part to be sutured can then be held up by the forceps, and a continuous Lembert’s suture is commenced close to the handle of the clamp on one side, and is carried round the intestine to the handle of the clamp on the other side, or Halsted’s suture may be used. The clamps are then disconnected, and each half is unclamped and removed separately. The con- tinuous suture is then carried over the hole from which the clamps were removed. The anastomosis is complete. This method is open to all the objections which I raised to O’Hara’s forceps, but it has even a greater fault, and that is, it is often extremely difficult to apply, the trouble being to get the whole of the circumference of the gut ends between the blades of the forceps unless a much larger number than four fixation stitches be first inserted. It is also very hard to get just the right amount of bowel wall invaginated ; it is easy to get too much, the result 4—2

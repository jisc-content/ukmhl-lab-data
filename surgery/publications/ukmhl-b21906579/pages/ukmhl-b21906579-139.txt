I 2 l Incisions into the Abdomen taminated during an intestinal operation, it is advisable to tuck the end of a sterilized cloth inside the incision on each side ; this will effectually protect the cut edges. The closure of the abdominal wound is of great import- ance, and the method of uniting all the structures of each edge with one row of silkworm-gut sutures should never be employed unless the patient is practically moribund. It is very doubtful whether the edges of the peritoneum were ever really brought in contact by this method. It is absolutely essential, in order to have a strong cicatrix, that each layer should be sutured separately. Some surgeons recommend catgut for the purpose, but I have always used silk, and I prefer it for two reasons—(i) it is more easily sterilized by boiling than other materials ; and (2) it is not readily absorbed, and so acts as a support to the abdominal wall for a considerable time after the wound has healed. The best method of uniting the peritoneum is by means of Halsted’s mattress sutures. Two artery forceps are applied to each edge of the peritoneum, and these are firmly held up, so as to separate the peritoneum from the viscera below, as is shown in Fig. 90. Mattress sutures are then inserted; each suture is commenced \ inch from the edge of the peritoneum on one side of the wound, and then it is passed through the peritoneum of the opposite side of the wound | inch from its edge, and finally returns through the two edges J inch from its point of entry. The stitches should be \ inch apart, and the two threads of each stitch should be £ inch apart. In a small wound only three or four are necessary. When these are tied, they produce a considerable amount of eversion of the peritoneum, and insure a smooth line of scar within the abdomen. The method of holding up the edges of the peritoneum with catch forceps facilitates the

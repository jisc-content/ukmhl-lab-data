I I 2 Intestinal Surgery- pushing the bowel inwards, and puncturing again. When the abscess cavity has been opened, it is much the wisest plan not to make any digital exploration of the cavity until it has been thoroughly flushed out. It is best to insert two large-sized tubes as far as they will go, and then to gently wash away the pus with a weak perchloride solution, or with izal, the fluid being introduced from an irrigator only a foot or so above the wound, and carried to the bottom of one of the drainage-tubes by means of a small rubber catheter ; in this way the cavity is flushed out from within outwards, and there is no danger of any adhesions being broken down. The abscess cavity should then be cautiously explored with the finger, and if the appendix can be felt it should be gently separated from its adhesions and brought out of the wound, when it is removed in the way described above. If it is not felt, no adhesions should be broken down to search for it. The two drainage-tubes are again introduced and the cavity irrigated in the way just described. The angles of the wound are closed with silkworm-gut sutures, and a gauze plug is introduced between the tubes, and the tubes themselves stitched in with gut sutures. In cases of abscess, the less you interfere with the parts the better ; the essential thing is to let out the pus and promote free drainage. The prognosis is usually good. 3. Removal of the Appendix after an Acute Attack, or for Recurrent Slight Attacks.â€”In this operation we have no fear of peritoneal infection, and the chief danger to avoid is the occurrence of a hernia at the scar. The incision is therefore of importance, and care should be taken not to divide any muscle across its long axis, but simply to separate its fibres. There are two incisions which may be employed ; the first gives quite sufficient room in ordinary cases, but the

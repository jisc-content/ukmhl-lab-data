47 End'toEnd Anastomosis be said of the method, as the principle is exactly the same as that for lateral anastomosis. A continuous Lembert is first passed. It is commenced with an ordinary stitch, which is tied about ■§■ inch on one side of the mesenteric attachment, and is continued along i inch of the other side. The suture should be inserted between i and 4 inch from the free edge, and includes the peritoneal and muscular Fig. 47.— End-to-End Anastomosis by Double Continuous Sutures. The mesenteric portion of the two ends is united by a continuous suture passing through all the coats (2). The needle and end marked 1 are those of the continuous Lembert shown in the preceding figure. coats only ; the stitches must be caught up every third stitch so as to prevent contraction. This needle is then laid aside, and another continuous suture is commenced about the same spot as the former, and made to penetrate all the coats of the bowel from within outwards. The suture is carried completely round the gut, taking care to oversew every third or fourth stitch. The end of the suture is united to the short end of the first knot, and the knot

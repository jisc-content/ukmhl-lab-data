Hernia.â€”It is often difficult to determine whether the bowel is really gangrenous or not, and in case of doubt it is better simply to reduce the bowel very carefully, leave it near the opening, and drain the wound ; then if the bowel should give way no extravasation into the general peritoneal cavity will take place. Mere blackness of the gut does not mean gangrene, and in many such cases the gut recovers its function. The important points, however, are the absence of any shine in the peritoneal coat and the deposit of lymph about the neck of the sac. If, of course, there be any free gas, an offensive odour, or pus in the sac, there will be no doubt of the occurrence of gangrene, and something must be done. The operative procedure will depend a good deal on the condition of the patient. If the patient is much collapsed, it is best to simply make an opening in the gangrenous knuckle of bowel, and to pass a medium-sized rubber tube into the bowel above the strangulated portion. In this way the intestinal contents will pour out of this tube, and will not foul the wound. The tube is stitched to the skin incision, and the rest of the wound left open and packed with gauze. If the patient rallies from the

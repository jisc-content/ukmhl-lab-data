Special Operations IOI Comparison of the Different Methods.—Much will depend upon the amount of adhesions which have formed around the artificial anus. Either of the first two methods may prove exceedingly difficult when adhesions are dense. In an ordinary case, however, I should be inclined to recommend the second operation, viz., the establishment of a new channel by a lateral anastomosis, as being the safest and the less likely to lead to any peritoneal infection. If, however, there is so much matting that the peritoneum cannot be opened by the incision i inch to the side of the artificial anus, then the first method of resection of the opening must be resorted to, but in this case any definite removal of a loop of gut will probably be impossible, and the artificial anus only will have to be excised. The objection to the resection operation is the risk of contamination of the peritoneum, the danger of subsequent stricture, or of failure of union of part of the anastomosis. The third method by the use of an enterotome is not to be recom- mended when dealing with the small intestine, since it is very difficult to avoid including only the mesenteric border of the gut, and the sloughing of this part may lead to dangerous haemorrhage or extravasation. 2. Artificial Anus of Large Intestine.—This con- dition will occur after the removal of a growth of the large intestine, or after a colotomy for an irremovable growth, or for intestinal obstruction from other causes, such as volvulus of the sigmoid, or after ulceration of the caecum in some cases of appendicitis. The distress occasioned will be greater the nearer the opening is to the caecum, on account of the liquid nature of the faeces ; an operation is all the more urgent when close to the caecum. I am, however, strongly of opinion that an artificial anus should be closed in any case when it is

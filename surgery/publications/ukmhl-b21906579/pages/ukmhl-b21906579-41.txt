25 Lateral Anastomosis 4. It takes less time than a lateral operation combined with closure of the ends of the gut. The disadvantages are : 1. It is more difficult to perform. 2. It is very difficult to insure the apposition of the portions of the gut between the layers of the mesentery. 3. The stitches at the mesenteric border may interfere with the nutrition of the rest of the line of union. 4. There is a great liability to cicatricial contraction producing a stricture. I am therefore disposed to recommend the lateral anastomosis wherever it is practicable, especially for surgeons who have not had much experience of intestinal work. I am sure that the surgeon will have much less anxiety, and the patient’s chances of recovery will be much greater. Section III I strongly recommend that the various methods of performing anastomoses by suture alone be practised before attempting those which involve the use of any apparatus, since a thorough knowledge and experience of the methods by simple suture is desirable before using an apparatus. Lateral Anastomosis by Suture Alone General Directions.—I have already referred to the importance of uniting together movable portions of bowel, but there is another point of equal importance to bear in mind, and that is to insure that the direction of the peri- staltic waves should be the same in the afferent and efferent portions of the gut. It is therefore necessary to give the loop of gut a half-turn before uniting the two portions, so as to insure that the intestinal contents will

124 Intestinal Surgery- liver, the gall-bladder, or the pancreas. In such cases the incision is made over the centre of the dull area, and the necessity for drainage, and for not disturbing any intra- peritoneal adhesions, is of more importance than the risk of hernia. The position of the incision in cases of removal of the appendix has been described on p. 113. The incision in cases of pylorectomy or pyloroplasty is best made about the centre of the right rectus muscle. This will expose the pylorus well. The incision in cases of gastro-enterostomy, where there is no question of removal of the pylorus, should be made about the centre of the left rectus muscle, as this will allow easy access to the jejunum. In cases of operation on the gall-bladder, the incision may be made 1 inch to the right of the middle line if it is intended to explore the ducts, and 1 inch to the inner side of the outer edge of the rectus if the gall-bladder alone is to be explored. The incision in cases of ileo-sigmoidostomy should be made about 4 inch inside the outer edge of the lower half of the left rectus muscle. This will give fairly good access to the sigmoid, which is the more fixed portion of gut. The lower end of the ileum can easily be brought out of this incision. In all these incisions the rectus muscle is not divided ; only its fibres are separated, and the two layers of its sheath are divided in slightly different planes. When the incision is close to one edge, it is best to separate the fibres rather than to push the whole muscle either inwards or outwards. After the operation the wound must be sutured in layers, as just described.

Intestinal Surgery closing a wound of the gut, but a simpler and quicker way is to insert a purse-string suture, passing through all the coats right round the gut close to its cut end, being careful to pick up the peritoneum on each side of the mesentery ; this is tied tightly, puckering up the end of the gut, as is shown in Fig. 24. The purse-string suture also has the effect of stopping all haemorrhage, and the clamp may with advantage be removed after this is applied. About three Halsted’s sutures will then completely invaginate Fig. 25.—Occlusion of Intestine. (L. Mark.) On the one side the invaginating stitches have been passed but not tied ; the other side shows the occlusion complete. Note the stitch nearest the mesentery has been tied first. this stump of gut and complete the occlusion. It is important to pass these invagination stitches about \ inch from the end of the gut, and the first one should be close to the mesentery ; this one must be tied before the others. This is shown in Figs. 25 and 26. Halsted’s Method.—The great advantage of this method is that all the stitches are passed before the gut is opened, and this minimizes the risk of faecal extravasa- tion ; it also facilitates the passage of the sutures.

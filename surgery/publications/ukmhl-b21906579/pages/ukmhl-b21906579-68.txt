Intestinal Surgery 52 being a valve-like projection at the line of suture, which might cause obstruction. I can find nothing to say in favour of the forceps. I have only included them in my demonstrations so as to show the difficulties of so-called aids to anastomosis. 3. Halsted's Rubber Bag1.—This consists of a rubber cylinder about 2\ inches long, of about the same diameter as the intestine ; a small rubber tube is in- serted at its centre, by which the cylinder can be dis- tended (see Fig. 51). It is employed as follows : Four stay sutures are inserted at the four cardinal points of the intestine, each stitch passing through all the coats. Fig. 51.—Halsted’s Air Cylinder. (Down Bros.) These are tied, and the ends cut short. The rubber cylinder is then introduced in a collapsed state between two of the sutures, and is then distended and the tube clamped (see Fig. 52). A row of Halsted’s mattress sutures are then inserted all round the anastomosis, special care being taken with the stitch at the mesentery, which is made to penetrate both sides of each piece of mesentery. All these stitches are tied, with the excep- tion of three at the centre of the convex border, which are left untied. The clamp is then taken off the rubber tube, and the collapsed cylinder can easily be with- drawn. The three remaining stitches are then tied,

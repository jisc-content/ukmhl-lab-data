Intestinal Surgery- 128 surround the seat of operation, and when possible these should be sterilized by steam, since mere soaking in i in 20 carbolic solution is not sufficient to render them sterile. A simple way of sterilizing is to boil them in a potato- steamer for twenty minutes, and then place them in 1 in 40 carbolic acid solution. Care must be taken to un- fold the towels before sterilizing, otherwise the folded part will not get affected by the steam. In the preparation of instruments, boiling is now universally employed ; if no special apparatus is at hand, an ordinary saucepan will answer. There are two points to pay attention to in boiling instruments. The first is to let the water boil for some minutes before introducing the instruments, so as to drive off all the air ; and the second, to add some ordinary washing-soda (in the proportion of a teaspoonful to a pint) to the water. These two precautions will prevent the instruments from becoming rusty by boiling. There is some difference of opinion as to whether knives should be boiled, since it undoubtedly affects the cutting edge ; the injurious effect can be reduced to a minimum by wrapping the knife in cotton-wool. Needles should always be boiled, since it is very difficult otherwise to sterilize their eyes ; they should be inserted in a piece of lint before boiling. After sterilization by heat, the instruments may either be placed in the tray ready for use, or if prepared at home, for an operation at a patientâ€™s house, they should be placed in a sterilized metal case, or in a sterilized stout linen or holland bag to be carried to the operation. I have some envelope-shaped bags made which answer the purpose well; they are sterilized before use and kept in an air- tight box. Most surgeons prefer^to put their instruments before use into some antiseptic solution, a weak carbolic solution

Lateral Anastomosis anastomosis, and an incision about if- inches long is made in each loop of intestine about J inch from the line of the continuous suture. Another curved needle armed with a long silk suture is then taken, and the opposite edges of the two openings are united by a continuous suture passing through all the coats ; in each stitch, however, the needle must be passed from the mucous surface of one edge through the serous, and made to enter the serous surface of the other edge, coming out at the mucous. Although Fig. 31.â€”Lateral Anastomosis by Double Continuous Sutures. A, Posterior continuous Lembert suture. the posterior edges of the incision are united first, it is more convenient to start the suture just on the anterior side of the angle of the incision, as it is difficult to close up the corner properly at the end. The suture is tied at its commencement and its short end clamped ; this is shown in Fig. 32. In passing this suture, care must be taken not to include the peritoneal stitch in it, and the suture must be oversewn at every fourth stitch. When the union of the posterior edges is completed, the anterior edges are united o

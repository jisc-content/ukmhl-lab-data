148 Intestinal Surgery not only is a strain put upon the stitches, but the already half-starved patient is prevented from taking food. One method of preventing vomiting which seems to have a good result is as follows : Immediately after the inhala- tion of chloroform is discontinued, the patient is made to inhale about a drachm of vinegar from a towel. This very frequently has the effect of making the patient sick at the time, but I have certainly found that a considerable number of patients are free from vomiting afterwards ; I therefore think the method worthy of trial. Nothing should be given by the mouth for four or five hours after the operation, but the patient should be allowed to rinse his mouth out with hot water at intervals. According to Shuter, the duration and severity of the vomiting is influenced by the nature of the anaesthetic ; thus, although vomiting is constant after ether, the most prolonged cases usually follow chloroform. He notes, too, that the worst cases are in the prime of life, while old people often escape altogether, and children suffer slightly. Anaemic people suffer badly, and alcoholics slightly. Various drugs have been recommended to prevent or control vomiting, but there is none which will act with certainty. Spencer gives his patients morphine and atropine every three hours to prevent vomiting, but other surgeons find that these drugs have the contrary effect ; cerium oxalate, bromidia, and small doses of hydrocyanic acid or of tinct. iodine have also been tried. Strong black coffee is very refreshing, and acts well in some cases. Ice by the mouth is of very little if of any value, and has a bad influence in needlessly abstracting heat from the body. When vomiting continues for more than twelve hours some other means will have to be employed. One of the best is to give the patient \ pint of hot water,

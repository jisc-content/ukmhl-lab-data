Intestinal Surgery 54 1. Mayo Robson’s bone bobbin. 2. Allingham’s bone bobbin. Both bobbins can be used in a similar manner, and the largest-sized bobbin which can be introduced into the intestine should be selected. The chief difficulty about the operation lies in the insertion of the posterior part of the continuous sutures before the introduction of the bobbin. Unfortunately, it is usually necessary to insert both of these before the bobbin is applied, as it is often almost impossible to accurately bring together the serous surfaces of the mesenteric portion of the gut after the bobbin is in position. The operation with Mayo Robson’s Bobbin should Fig. 53.—Mayo Robson’s Bone Bobbin. (Down Bros.) be performed as follows : Each loop of the bowel is clamped about 2 inches from the cut end. A straight or curved sewing-needle, armed with a long fine silk suture, is then used to unite the serous and muscular coats of the two pieces of gut, commencing about \ inch from their mesenteric borders and 4 inch from their free edges. This is tied at its commencement, and the ends left long. With one end a continuous Lembert or Dupuytren stitch is carried round the posterior part of the line of union in the same way as described for union by simple suture (vide p. 46). When the suture has been carried to a point \ inch the other side of the mesenteries, it is laid aside and clamped. Another

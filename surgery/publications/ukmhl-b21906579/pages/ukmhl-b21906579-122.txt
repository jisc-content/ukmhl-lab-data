106 Intestinal Surgery- In operations for acute obstruction there is not usually much clue to the situation of the tumour, and so the incision should be made in the middle line in the first instance. When the patient is suffering from faecal vomit- ing, some surgeons urge that general anaesthesia should not be employed, since several deaths have occurred from vomited matter entering the trachea, and so they advise operation under cocaine. I cannot, however, think it right to inflict the severe pain and considerable shock of an abdominal operation upon a patient who is already much weakened from the effect of obstruction, since even if the skin be anaesthetized by cocaine there is great pain and shock on handling the mesentery. My practice when faecal vomiting is present is to pass a stomach-tube before administering the anaesthetic and wash out the stomach with warm water ; this does not usually produce any collapse, but should it do so a little brandy and a hypo- dermic injection of strychnine may be given. With regard to the choice of chloroform or ether, although the latter is more stimulating, the former is distinctly prefer- able, since there is less chance of coughing and violent abdominal movement ; nothing is so unpleasant when dealing with greatly distended intestine as the convulsive cough and straining often met with in patients under ether ansesthesia. The method of procedure in cases of acute obstruction is to open the abdomen in the middle line below the umbilicus ; then, by introducing two fingers, the sigmoid can be explored to find if it is dilated. If dilated, it is followed down with the finger till the obstruc- tion is felt. If this is movable, another incision should be made in the left inguinal region, and the growth brought out of the abdomen. Much assistance will be afforded by manipulating through both abdominal incisions; the growth should then be removed, and a Paulâ€™s tube tied in

142 Intestinal Surgery- in the fresh air, and avoidance of fatigue, either mental or bodily. Treves specially denounces the practice of carrying a heavy bag just before an operation, and also advises strengthening the muscles of the arm by dumbells, etc. The clothing of the surgeon is of importance ; his arms should be bared by rolling up his sleeves, and his outdoor clothes should be completely covered by an overall, made of linen, which is sterilized by heat. If this is not at hand, an ordinary large sterilized bath-towel should be used. The main preparation of the surgeon, of course, concerns his hands and arms, and too much care cannot be directed to these. The method of disinfection of the hands varies with different surgeons. The method I adopt is to scrub the hands and arms with a flesh-brush and ordinary yellow soap ; after this the hands, and especially the nails, are cleansed with an antiseptic ethereal solution of soap. The washing should take at least five minutes ; after this the hands are soaked for another three or five minutes in a 1 in 1,000 solution of perchloride of mercury. With regard to the nails, most of the writers on aseptic surgery recommend them to be trimmed as short as possible. I do not, however, think that this is desirable, since the sensitiveness of the finger-ends is diminished by having the nails too short. I consider that they should be about XV inch long ; when not longer than this, there is no difficulty in cleansing them with ethereal soap. The best plan is, after cleaning them with a knife or other special cleaner, to wash the hands with soap and water for some time, and then to again remove any loose or sodden epithelium from under the nails with a cleaner. The disinfection is completed by scrubbing with ethereal soap and water.

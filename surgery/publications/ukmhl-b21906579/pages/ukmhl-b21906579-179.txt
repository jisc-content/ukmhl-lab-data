Treatment after Abdominal Operations 161 boric solution, or with peroxide of hydrogen. All accumulation of food and sordes should be removed from the gums and teeth by means of a small piece of wool soaked in dilute carbolic or boric lotion. Attention to the state of the mouth is of importance not only in preventing decomposition of the stomach contents, with consequent vomiting and diarrhoea, in preventing septic broncho-pneumonia, which has been a fruitful cause of death after stomach operations, but also in preventing the formation of a parotid bubo, which may lead to suppuration and exhaust the patient’s strength. Position of Patient.—As before stated, the patient need not lie flat in bed after stomach and intestinal operations, especially after gastro-enterostomy, since the escape of contents out of the stomach is facilitated by the patient being slightly propped up. It is unnecessary to state that the patient must not move himself, but must allow the nurses to change his position. This change of position also has an influence on the bowels, since it often relieves the condition known as pseudo-ileus, which has been already referred to. In a simple uncomplicated case of abdominal section the patient should be kept in bed for fourteen days, and may then be moved on to a couch ; but he should not be allowed to walk until the end of three weeks. In hospital practice the patient usually leaves the hospital at the end of a month. I have not made any mention of peritonitis, since it will only occur after faulty suturing, or where septic material has been introduced either by the surgeon’s hands, instruments, ligatures, or sponges. In cases of operation for septic tubal abscesses, or for those con- nected with the vermiform appendix, peritonitis is a real danger, and may occur after imperfect cleansing of ii

Special Operations 97 i. Artificial Anus of Small Intestine.—This condition is of a serious nature, and urgently calls for some operative treatment, both on account of the distress caused by the continual passage of liquid motions from the wound, and also from the fact that patients rapidly emaciate when there is an artificial anus in the small intestine. Of course, this interference with nutrition will be more marked the higher up in the intestinal tract that the opening is situated. There are three principal methods of dealing with an artificial anus : (1) Resection of the whole opening, and an end-to- end anastomosis of the afferent and efferent portions of gut. (2) A lateral anastomosis between the afferent and efferent portions of gut combined with occlusion of the afferent portion of the gut between the anastomosis and the artificial anus. (3) The application of an enterotome, either Dupuy- tren’s or Mickulicz’s. In any operation for the relief of this condition it must be remembered that, although the artificial anus was originally made by an opening only in the convex border of the gut, the loop of intestine will have been so much pulled on that there will probably have developed a well-marked spur, and the passage of faeces onwards past the artificial anus will be effectually prevented ; simple closure of the opening then will not be of any use. Secondly, it must be borne in mind that no operation is of use unless the channel is clear below the opening. (1) In the first method referred to, the artificial anus should be well purified, and then plugged with gauze, and its edges sewn together with silkworm-gut sutures over the gauze plug. An incision is made all round the anus, and 7

146 Intestinal Surgery- dressing next the wound is left undisturbed for ten days, when it is removed, and the stitches are taken out ; a similar dressing is then reapplied for another week. The next point is the management of the patient after the anaesthetic, particularly with a view to diminish shock, and to prevent, as far as possible, that persistent post- anaesthetic sickness which is a complication fraught with especial risk in stomach and intestinal surgery. In the first place, care should be taken in moving the patient back into bed ; three people, all on one side, should lift' the patient, one placing his arm under the thighs and buttocks, the second his arms under the back and shoulders, and the third supporting the head and looking after the arm opposite the lifters, so that it is not bent under the body.

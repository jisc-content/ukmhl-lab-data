49 End-ToEnd Anastomosis W: One of the clamps is applied on either side of the loop of gut to be removed, and it is tightly clamped. Care is taken that each clamp is applied slantingly, and that its end extends as far as, but not beyond, the mes- enteric border of the gut. The diseased portion of the gut is now cut away close to each clamp, and the mesentery treated as described before (vide p. 36). The two clamps are now brought together, and are fixed together with their spring clip. A continuous Lembert’s suture is commenced at the handle end of each clamp, bringing the serous surfaces of the two pieces of intestine together over the blades of the clamp. This i Fig. 49.—Method of Performing End-to-End Anastomosis by Halsted’s Suture over O’Hara’s Forceps. (Down Bros.) is continued completely around the gut, taking care to pick up the mesentery of each end in passing. The clamps are now disconnected, loosened, and withdrawn separately, and the hole through which they were with- drawn is closed by the continuous suture. The anasto- mosis is now complete. The anastomosis may also be effected by a row of Halsted’s sutures, as shown in Fig 49. The objections to this method are (a) that a special apparatus is necessary, and will not always be at hand ; (b) that a portion of the wall of the gut is apt to slip out from the clamp before the suture is com- plete ; (c) that it is difficult to insure that the continuous 4

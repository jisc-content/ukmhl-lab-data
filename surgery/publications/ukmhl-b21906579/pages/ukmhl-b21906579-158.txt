140 Intestinal Surgery- most cases be absolute, since bacteria are lodged in the deepest parts of sebaceous glands, and it is practically impossible to be certain of clearing these out. Therefore, after the most elaborate preparation, the skin must still be regarded as a source of danger, and should be kept covered up with sterilized towels, so that no internal organ or ligature touches it. The routine which I employ is as follows : Twenty-four hours before the operation the skin of the whole abdomen is scrubbed with soap and water, and if the patient be a hairy man the part of the abdomen to be opened is shaved. After this the skin is again scrubbed with a flesh-brush and soap ; this is washed off, and turpentine is rubbed in. Lastly, carbolic acid solution, i in 20, is applied with a flesh- brush ; a sterilized towel, soaked in 1 in 40 carbolic solution, is put over the prepared part and covered with a piece of jaconet, and kept in position with a many- tailed bandage. Immediately before the operation the skin is again scrubbed with soap and water, then with 1 in 20 carbolic, and, lastly, with some 1 in 1,000 perchloride of mercury. The brush should not be used for any other purpose, but should be kept for this alone ; it should previously have been sterilized by boiling, or by having been kept in 1 in 20 carbolic acid solution for twenty-four hours. With regard to soap, either ordinary yellow or soft soap may be used; personally, I prefer an ethereal solution of soap, since the ether enables the soap to penetrate more deeply into the sebaceous glands. The removal of fat may also be effected by ether, benzine, alcohol, or turpentine ; the latter is preferable, since it possesses a slight antiseptic action. Some surgeons are not content with such preparations, and recommend more extensive ones. Thus Giulot directs that the abdominal wall should be treated for

Intestinal Surgery- io8 In cases where the growth of the caecum or ascending colon is fixed, or there is infection of the peritoneum, I would not do a preliminary colotomy, as the distress occasioned to the patient by the passage of liquid faeces is too great, and in an incurable case the patient is not likely to submit to another abdominal section for the purpose of having an anastomosis done when the duration of life will be so short. I therefore think it right to subject the patient to the slightly extra risk of an ileo- sigmoidostomy at the time. This operation gives imme- diate relief, and in most of my cases a motion has been passed f>er annum within a few hours of the termination of the operation. Although, as I stated, the risk is greater in cases of acute obstruction than during the quiescent period, I do not think that it is much greater than colo- tomy under similar conditions. I have performed ten ileo-colostomies for acute obstruction, and of these eight recovered and two died. The cases that recovered had no further symptom of obstruction ; the ultimate result was not unsatisfactory, the patients living for three to eighteen months after the operation. The points which I wish to lay stress on are : (i) That an early exploratory operation should be advised in any case presenting even vague symptoms of carcinoma of the colon ; (2) that the growth should be removed at once at the time of the exploratory operation, and that the re-establishment of the intestinal canal would be best effected by a lateral anastomosis between the ileum and sigmoid, which should either be done at the time or at an interval of a few weeks ; (3) that colotomy should never be performed except in cases of a growth fixed in the lower part of the sigmoid; (4) that in any irremovable growth situated above the middle of the sigmoid flexure an ileo- sigmoidostomy should be performed instead of colotomy.

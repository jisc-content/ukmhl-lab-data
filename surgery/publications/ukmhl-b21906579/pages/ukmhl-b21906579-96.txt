Intestinal Surgery- 8o method of operating in two stages has many advantages. In the first place, it enables the patient to regain strength by taking food before submitting to the shock of the pylorectomy ; then the shock is less, as the duration of each operation is not considerable ; and as there is not so much need for hurry, the second operation is likely to be more thorough. In five cases in which I have operated by this method the results have been satisfactoryâ€”all recovered from the operations, and lived for from one to three years after the operations.

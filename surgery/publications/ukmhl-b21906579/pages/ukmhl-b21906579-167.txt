In persistent vomiting also the bowels must be thoroughly cleared out. When, however, vomiting continues for two or three days, and the tongue becomes dry, more energetic treatment is indicated, and a soft stomach-tube should be passed, and the stomach washed out with several pints of boiled water, so as to remove all decomposing material. This must be repeated if necessary. The position of the patient, too, after stomach opera- tions has some influence on vomiting; thus, after the first few hours the patient should be propped up in bed with one or two pillows, and may also be turned on to the right side, so as to encourage the passage of fluids through the new pylorus.

Preparations before Abdominal Operations 133 for some considerable time, and it is also essential to unwind the silk before doing this, otherwise the central part of the hank would not be sterilized. It is best to wind a small amount on a small glass reel or on a glass microscopic slide, and so only sterilize about the quantity which will be needed for each operation ; there is always a certain risk in using a reel of silk for a second operation unless it be sterilized again, and with the finest silks boiling more than twice will probably make them rotten. I prefer to boil my silks for at least half an hour in Listerâ€™s strong antiseptic solution (a solution containing 1 in 20 carbolic acid and 1 in 1,000 of perchloride of mercury) ; they are then placed in 1 in 20 carbolic solution until required for use, when they are placed in a very dilute antiseptic if they are to be used for intra-abdominal work. The addition of some dye such as carmine or methyl blue to the solution when boiling is an advantage, as not only does it make the fine silk easier to distinguish, but it also in a way affords some indication as to whether the silk has been sufficiently sterilized, since if the silk has been wound too tightly, or has not been boiled for a sufficient time, it will be found that only the outer part of the reel has become dyed, and we may assume that the inner undyed portion of the silk has not been completely sterilized. Silk should never be boiled in soda solution with the instruments, since it is thereby rendered rotten. As ligatures may be weakened in pre- paration, it is important before beginning a continuous intestinal suture to test the strength of the silk. Horse- hair and silkworm gut do not require to be boiled before use ; prolonged soaking in 1 in 20 carbolic solution is all that is required. With regard to catgut, although I seldom employ it in ab- dominal surgery, it is often used in intestinal anastomoses.

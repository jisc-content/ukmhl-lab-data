150 Intestinal Surgery not only is the absorption slower, but a considerable amount of skin round the puncture may slough. Brandy also and caffeine may be injected hypodermically. One of the most powerful methods of diminishing shock is by the injection of about a pint of warm normal saline solution, at a temperature of no° F., into the rectum ; this should be done slowly in order to insure retention, and before the patient is removed from the table. When the shock continues this may be repeated as often as every hour. Half an ounce of brandy may be added to the enema. The next method of treating shock is by the subcutaneous or intravenous injection of normal saline solution. The subcutaneous method is very popular in France, and it is usual to inject 2 to 4 pints of saline solution subcutaneously during the first twenty- four hours. In some ways the subcutaneous method is preferable to the intravenous, since it does not cause such a rapid dilution of the blood, an effect which may produce imperfect aeration and consequent dyspnoea. It has the disadvantage of being rather painful. The improvement caused by intravenous injection is often very transient, and a second injection has to be made, while sometimes a third or a fourth is necessary. Care must be taken in these injections to keep up the temperature of the saline solution to 105° F. Intravenous injection should be made into the median basilic vein ; the fluid is introduced by means of a funnel attached by rubber tubing to a cannula. The funnel should be held about 3 or 4 feet above the arm, and the fluid allowed to run in slowly. In the case of subcutaneous injection a syringe must be used, and the fluid forced by its means into the subcu- taneous tissue, that of the axilla being best adapted for the procedure. Great care must be taken to sterilize the saline solution ; it should be boiled and allowed to

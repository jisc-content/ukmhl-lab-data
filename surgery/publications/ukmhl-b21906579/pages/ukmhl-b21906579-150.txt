Intestinal Surgery- i32 some ; these only require boiling for half an hour, and, when cool, they are wrung dry and placed in a weak perchloride solution or in sterilized normal saline solution. One of the easiest ways of preparing artificial sponges is from Gamgee tissue ; this is cut into squares of three sizes—- namely, 12 inches, 6 inches, and 3 inches ; about six are required of each size. The edges of these squares are sewn over, so as to prevent any escape of the cotton-wool during use ; they are then prepared for use by boiling. During an operation they can be used over and over again after washing them out in saline solution, in the same way as marine sponges. Another method is to wrap up round pledgets of cotton-wool in gauze, which is tied on ; these are then sterilized by steam or by boiling. This method is not so handy as the use of Gamgee tissue, since the swabs take longer to make, and, moreover, they are not so good after they have been once used, as they cannot be washed out so easily. Ligatures, etc.—Of even more importance than the preparation of sponges and instruments is the insurance of absolute asepsis in ligatures and sutures which are to remain in the wound. Here, again, I should never leave inside the abdomen a ligature or suture prepared at a shop, and I consider it only right to prepare them my- self, or have them done under my own superintendence. The materials employed for ligatures and for sutures in abdominal surgery are silk, catgut, silkworm-gut, horse- hair, or even fine wire. The best silk is that known as Chinese twist, and can be obtained in sizes ranging from 000 to 6 ; the two finest sizes are used for ligatures of small vessels and for intes- tinal sutures, No. 1 or 2 for sutures of the abdominal wall, and the larger sizes for ligatures of pedicles, etc. The only reliable method of preparing silk is by boiling

42 Intestinal Surgery testine below the anastomosis, which is done by a row of Lembert’s sutures, or two or three Halsted’s sutures. If time permits, before this is done the mucous mem- brane should be brought together with some interrupted stitches. This operation is performed very quickly, is very easy, and is followed by satisfactory results. 2. The method of anastomosis by two layers of in- terrupted sutures is a very good one, and is usually done by the Czerny-Lembert or Wolfer’s method. In order to insure that corresponding portions of the circumference of the two pieces of intestine are united together, it is best to B Fig. 41.—Maunsell’s Method. (Maunsell.) The suture is complete, the intussusception has been reduced, and the opening in the bowel below (B) has been closed. insert two Lembert’s sutures into each piece of gut, one at the convex border and the other close to the mesenteric attachment, about 4 inch from the free edge. These are not tied, but the ends of the corresponding stitches are held together with clamp-forceps, and so define a line for the insertion of the row of interrupted sutures. They also raise up a ridge on the serous sur- face which renders the introduction of the Lembert’s stitches more easy. The method is shown in Fig. 42. The two pieces of gut must now be turned over in order to insert a row of interrupted sutures going through

83 Special Operations namely, that the opposite walls of the small intestine stretched over the bobbin prevents the passage of faeces through the anastomosis so long as they remain in situ. When a lateral anastomosis is performed for the cure of an artificial anus, or as part of an operation for the removal of a tumour of bowel, the small intestine on the distal side of the anastomosis will have to be divided and occluded as described on p. 27. When, however, the operation is performed for obstruction due to irre- movable cancer no occlusion operation will be necessary. The operation of implantation consists in division of the ileum at a few inches from the ileo-caecal valve, and then making an opening (of a length corresponding to the diameter of the ileum) in the anterior surface of the colon or sigmoid. The proximal end of the ileum is then united to this opening either by a double row of continuous sutures or by Maunsell’s method, which, however, necessitates another incision in the colon. The distal end of the ileum is then closed as described before. The disadvantages of implantation are (1) that it is difficult to prevent leakage at the mesenteric border of the ileum, and (2) that the opening is liable to contract, especially if the anastomosis be performed by continuous sutures. The operation of ileo-colostomy is a very satisfactory one, and the mortality is small ; it is strange that patients do not suffer any ill-effects from having nearly the whole of their large intestine cut off. After a few weeks the motions become quite formed, and there is no increased frequency in passage of them. 2.

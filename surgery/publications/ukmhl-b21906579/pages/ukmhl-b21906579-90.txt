74 Intestinal Surgery Comparison between the Different Methods of Performing Gastro-Enterostomy Disregarding for the moment Rouxâ€™s operation as being much more severe, and only permissible in patients who are in a very robust condition, we will consider first the main points in favour of the anterior and posterior operations, and then discuss the best methods of attaching the jejunum to the stomach. The points in favour of the anterior operation are : 1. The greater ease in its performance, and conse- quently increased rapidity in operating. 2. The certainty of uniting the jejunum to the stomach in a slanting direction. 3. In the erect position the anastomotic opening will be at the lowest point of the stomach, since the weight of the attached small intestine will pull the anterior surface of the stomach downwards. 4. The avoidance of any injury to the transverse meso- colon, and the absence of any risk of hernia through the opening. The disadvantages of the operation are : 1. The danger of compression of the transverse colon by the jejunum when the anastomosis is being made too close to its commencement. 2. When the patient is in the horizontal position the position of the opening will favour the passage of bile into the stomach, and will hinder the passage of stomach contents into the jejunum. 3. As the jejunum is so much displaced out of its ordinary position, there is a greater danger of a kink just beyond the anastomosis. 4. Distension of the transverse colon may press upon the jejunum and produce obstruction to the passage of bile.

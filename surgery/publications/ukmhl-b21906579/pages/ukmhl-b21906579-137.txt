CHAPTER VIII 119 INCISIONS INTO THE ABDOMEN, AND THE METHOD OF CLOSING THEM The choice of the position of an abdominal incision is of considerable importance. In the first place, except in the case of an exploratory laparotomy, it should be made as directly as possible over the organ on which it is desired to operate. In the case of an exploratory laparotomy, the incision should be near the middle line, either above or below the umbilicus, according as it is wished to explore the upper or lower part of the abdomen. The next point is that the incision should be made in such a place and in such a way that there is no risk of subsequent hernia. The most important factors in pre- venting hernia are the avoidance of fibrous intermuscular spaces, such as the linea alba or the linea semilunaris, and the separation of the fibres of muscles instead of their division. For this reason the old incision in the middle line either above or below the umbilicus should be aban- doned, since it is difficult to secure firm union of the fibrous septa ; this is more especially the case with incisions above the umbilicus, where even to unite the cut edge of the linea alba is very difficult, and hernia is a very frequent result. In the place of the median incision, the skin should be incised about f inch to one side, and Cheyne recommends

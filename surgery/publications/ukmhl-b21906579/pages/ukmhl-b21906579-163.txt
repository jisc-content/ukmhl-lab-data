Treatment after Abdominal Operations i45 and about 1 inch wide is wrung out in 1 in 40 carbolic, and applied to the wound ; the surrounding skin is then carefully dried with dry cyanide gauze, and a piece of dry gauze, of one thickness only, and about 3 inches wider than the moist dressing, is put over the wound and surrounding skin. This is fixed to the skin by brushing on collodion, which is dried by fanning. Ordinary collodion is far preferable to the flexible variety ; it dries more quickly, and is less liable to become loosened. When the collodion is dry, several thicknesses of dry gauze are placed over the wound and the area some distance round it, and over this some ordinary absorbent wool, or a layer of Gamgee tissue, is applied. The dressing is kept in place by a many-tailed bandage, which should be made, not of one piece of flannel with its sides torn into horizontal strips, but of six or eight strips of flannel, each 5 or 6 inches wide, and sewn together at the back in such a way that each strip overlaps the other for one-half its width. It should also be made to fit, care being taken that the tails are neither too long nor too short ; the simplest way to gauge the necessary length of the tails is to measure round the most prominent part of the abdomen, and to make the tails 12 to 18 inches longer than the girth. It should also be made the right width from above downwards ; the first tail should encircle the pelvis, and the last tail the chest. The best materials for it are either ordinary flannel or a very thin variety known as nun’s veiling. The ordinary flannel is the best in the winter, and the nun’s veiling is certainly more comfortable in hot weather. There is no objection to the many-tailed bandage being loosened and the cotton-wool readjusted, to make the patient more comfortable, even on the day after the operation, since the fixing of the dressing with collodion prevents any risk of the wound being infected during the process.

Operations on the Appendix Vermiformis 111 will be detected. It will be better to make a second incision over the appendix, and remove it through that, rather than attempt to do so through the median incision. The further procedure is the same as before stated. The prognosis is always very grave. 2. In cases of abscess in the region of the appendix, an operation will rarely be needed till between the sixth and twelfth day ; about the tenth day is the most usual. In these cases a definite swelling with dulness will be present ; and as it is most important to avoid opening the general peritoneal cavity, the incision should be made at a little distance within the edge of the dull area. If the dulness does not extend far forwards, the incision must be made as far back as the anterior superior crest of the ileum, but as a general rule the centre of the dull area is the best point. The skin incision should be about 3 inches long, and the muscles must all be freely divided in the direction of the incision. When the fascia transversalis is divided, the peritoneum is exposed, but this is usually very much thickened, and often resembles bowel both in appearance and to the touch, and may cause one to hesitate before making an opening into it. It is, however, most impor- tant not to separate the peritoneum from the fascia transversalis outwards, so as to try to get behind it, as this opens up a cellular space where pus will afterwards burrow. It is better, if one feels any hesitation in opening the thickened peritoneum which presents in the wound, to puncture it first with an ordinary needle, when pus will well up out of the puncture, after which the surgeon need feel no hesitation in making a free opening with a scalpel. If it should happen to be gut which presents in the wound, the puncture with a needle will do no harm, and the pus will be found by separating the tissues outwards and

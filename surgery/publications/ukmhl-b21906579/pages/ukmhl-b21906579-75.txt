EncUtoEnd Anastomosis 59 Anastomosis by Apparatus Alone There is only one method which needs description in this class, and that is Murphy’s button. This is of undoubted value where extreme rapidity of execution is desirable, as when the patient is in a very grave con- dition. It, however, does not yield very satisfactory results, since the separation of the button takes place by sloughing of the opposed portions of intestine, and union may not be firm when the slough separates, and so extravasation may occur. Again, the button, after being passed on, may cause fatal ulceration and perforation at some point below, or it may cause obstruction at the Fig. 59.—Murphy’s Button. 7(Down Bros.) ileo-caecal valve, and require a second operation for its removal. In the case of lateral anastomosis it is open to the further objection that it causes an actual obstruc- tion till it separates. The button is made in various sizes, but the two princi- pal ones are those for small and large intestine. It is too well known to require any detailed description ; the accompanying diagram (Fig. 59) explains its mechanism. The two halves are approximated by simply pushing them together, but they can only be separated by un- screwing. One half only has a spring, and this end is the heavier, and must always be placed in the lower segment of intestine.

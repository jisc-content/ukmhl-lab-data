Lateral Anastomosis 31 sutures, so as to completely bury the knots. These two end stitches should be passed first, and if they be held up it will be easy to pass the rest of the row in a straight line between them. The stitches in this row are not tied, but their ends are clamped with Spencer Wells forceps ; about nine to twelve will have to be passed, as the anterior row is much longer than the posterior. Clamps are now applied on each side of the anastomosis, and two blunt hooks are introduced in the middle of the row of sutures, and the threads are drawn aside so as to expose the two portions Fig. 29.—Halsted’s Method. (Jessett.) All the sutures have been passed, and those of the posterior row have been drawn aside to permit the openings to be made. of intestine included within the sutured area. An opening is now made in each piece of gut with a scalpel, and enlarged to the whole length of the line of stitches with scissors. This is shown in Fig. 29. The bleeding will be very slight, and probably no point will require ligature, since any oozing will stop when the sutures are tightened. The opening should be made in the collapsed portion of gut first, so as to lessen the danger of extravasation. When both openings have been made and bleeding - points ligatured, the blunt hooks are removed and the sutures tightened by pulling on the forceps ; the stitches are then

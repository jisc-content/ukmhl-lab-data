138 Intestinal Surgery is certainly the easiest and quickest to perform, but the intravenous infusion produces the most rapid effect. Whichever method is employed, from 2 to 4 pints will have to be injected. Stewart Lewis insists on what he calls the saturation method in the management of laparotomy in the place of the older methods, which had the effect of depriving the system of water (by purges, etc.), and so stimulating the absorptive power of the peritoneum. He points out that a certain amount of drainage of tissue fluids is an unavoidable evil in laparotomy, being produced by preliminary purgation, by keeping the stomach empty to avoid ether vomiting, and, thirdly, by loss of blood. This drainage should be limited in every possible way. In the preparation of his patients, while emptying and asepticizing the intestinal canal, he insists that the tissues should be fluid saturated to the physiological limit. The diet should be limited to that which will produce the minimum of both gas and toxins. Intestinal antiseptics should be employed, and several mild purga- tives should be given instead of one, which is either imperfect or excessive and exhausting. Two or three grains of calomel, combined with some cholagogue, should be given eighteen hours before, and six hours before the operation 4 quarts of normal saline should be injected into the rectum very slowly, to insure long retention. For forty-eight hours before the operation copious draughts of water are given, 6 to 8 ounces being administered every two hours. In order to lessen the post-operative shock and the tendency to paralytic dilatation of the intestine, several American surgeons have recently recommended that subcutaneous injections of ergot should be given before and after the operation. Ordinary ergot solution pro-

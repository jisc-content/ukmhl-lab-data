*04 Intestinal Surgery toneum, and, secondly, in the sigmoid, and often in the transverse colon, the intestinal contents are solid, so that there is a great strain on the stitches. These conditions have led me to abandon the end-to-end anastomosis after excision of the growth, and I prefer to re-establish the intestinal channel by means of a lateral anastomosis between the ileum and the colon. Formerly I was in favour of performing a lateral anastomosis first, and removing the growth by a secondary operation, but my experience with this method has not been fortunate, since in two cases of carcinoma of the csecum in which I employed it the patients did very well after the ileo- colostomy, but, on attempting to remove the growth after an interval of fourteen days, the tumour was found to have contracted fresh adhesions, and the performance became much more difficult. In other cases so much relief was afforded by the ileo-colostomy that further operation was refused. I am therefore inclined to advise that in every case the loop of gut containing the tumour should first be removed, together with its mesocolon, the incision through the gut being at least an inch from the growth ; the mesenteric vessels, too, should be divided some distance from the gut. To do this, the loop of gut containing the growth should be brought outside the abdominal incision, and after passing a circular purse-string suture through all the coats of the bowel, and picking up the mesocolon about i-|- inches above the growth, an incision should be made in the convex border of the gut \ inch below the suture, and a Paul’s tube slipped in and tied in position with the purse-string suture, which has the effect of stopping all bleeding ; the gut is now completely divided below the Paul’s tube, and the growth removed after clamping the end of the gut below the tumour. The cut end of the distal portion of the gut is then invaginated on itself and

Treatment after Abdominal Operations 157 method of introduction is to use a soft rubber rectal tube the size of a 12 or 14 catheter, which should be passed about 6 inches up the rectum ; connected with the tube is a funnel, which should be raised 2 feet above the bed. This is better than a syringe, since the fluid will flow more evenly and slowly into the rectum, and so is more likely to be retained ; the risk of forcing in air, too, is diminished. The whole enema should not exceed 6 ounces in bulk, and in cases of irritable rectum only 3 or 4 ounces should be given ; it should be of a temperature of ioo° F., and should be given every four or six hours. Practically only substances in solution can be absorbed from the rectum, so unpeptonized milk or beef-tea are useless ; stimulants, such as spirits, wine, tea, or coffee, are most readily absorbed ; extractives and peptones are also of value. The necessity of giving digested meat has been recognised for a long time, but the process of preparing the enemata has been much improved by the intro- duction of the various peptonizing and zyminizing powders now on the market. The older enemata were prepared with fresh pancreas. The following are a few of the best : 1. The enema which I have been in the habit of using is made as follows : Milk 2 ounces, strong beef-tea 2 ounces, yolk of one egg, liq. pancreatin (Benger) 1 drachm. This is to be prepared one hour before use, and to be kept at a temperature of ioo° F. Half to 1 ounce of brandy is added, when necessary, immediately before use. 2. Von Leube’s.—Five ounces of finely-scraped meat are chopped very fine, and to this is added 1% ounces of finely-chopped pancreas ; the whole is suspended in 3 ounces of lukewarm water, and stirred to the consistence of a thick pulp. This makes one injection.

39 End'toEnd Anastomosis the mucous membrane. As before mentioned, it does not much matter if the suture penetrates through all the coats of intestine if the knot is inside, since the suture tends to separate in the direction of its knot, and the danger of extravasation lies in the communication established after separation of the sutures rather than in any infection tracking along its thread. In order to pass and tie all sutures inside the bowel, a temporary intussusception is produced. Maunsell’s Method. — The mesenteric and convex borders of each piece of gut are united by two Fig. 37.—Maunsell’s Method. (Maunsell.) The sutures uniting the mesenteric and convex borders should have been shown passed so that their knots were inside. The bowel is being opened below the anastomosis. sutures passed through all the coats and with their knots inside the mucous membrane ; they should be tied loosely, and their ends left long. A vertical in- cision is then made in the convex border of the lower segment of the bowel about to 2 inches below its cut end, and of the same length as the diameter of the bowel, at this point. A pair of clamp forceps are introduced through this incision, and the ends of the two guiding sutures are seized and brought through the

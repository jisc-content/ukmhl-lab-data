General Considerations 5 direction of least resistance, which will be the cavity of the gut, since on the outside there is the general intra-abdominal pressure. As the knot has to traverse the whole thickness of the bowel coats, a considerable amount of ulceration is necessary to allow it to pass within the lumen, and the tract left is of a considerable size, and it is thus that extravasation may occur. When, therefore, sutures pass through all the coats, the knot should be placed inside the bowel, and even if no supporting row of sutures be inserted, this will not lead to infection and extravasation. IV. It is most essential to tie each stitch as tightly as possible, since a stitch which is tied sufficiently tightly when the gut is collapsed will become loose when the gut is distended, the reason being that when the bowel is collapsed the muscular coat is much thicker than when it is distended, all its coats being then thinned. It must be remembered that every injury to the intestine will produce some temporary paralysis, which is accom- panied by dilatation of the part. V. The anastomoses should, when possible, be done outside the abdominal cavity, so as to lessen the risk of infection ; this is not difficult, if only movable portions of the gut be united. VI. A surgeon should not be dependent upon any special apparatus for the performance of an anastomosis, since the necessity for the performance will often arise in the course of some other operation when the special apparatus is not at hand. It is therefore desirable that he should first be perfect in some simple suture, and after this he can use any apparatus if he desires it. VII. Other things being equal, the patientâ€™s chances of recovery are greatly enhanced by rapid operating, and this can only be obtained by practice.

General Considerations o large numbers in the jejunum, and are absent in the lower part of the ileum, and can be easily felt through the bowel, gives us an easy way of distinguishing a coil of jejunum from one of the ileum. To sum up, the mucous coat is the most friable, the submucous coat is the toughest, the muscular coat is the thickest, but not the strongest, and the peritoneal coat is incomplete. The peritoneal coat, however, is of the very greatest importance, since the earliest and firmest adhesions between portions of intestine are formed between adjacent peritoneal coats. It is, therefore, essential that portions of intestines which are covered with peritoneum should be selected for an anastomosis. In the small intestine the two sides of the mesentery are sufficiently close together that when the adjacent portions are in contact they will complete the peritoneal investment, and so end-to-end anastomosis presents no great difficulty. In the ascending and descending colon, however, the absence of peritoneal covering over one- half the circumference makes an end-to-end anastomosis a hazardous procedure. Generally speaking, the part of the intestinal wall which unites most readily is the convex border, or that portion exactly opposite to the mesenteric attachment ; this is the point selected for incision of the gut in the case of extraction of a foreign body such as a gall-stone, or for the temporary relief of obstruction. This also is the point selected for the line of union in performing a lateral anastomosis, and so it follows that a lateral anastomosis is a very safe method of uniting intes- tines. II. Another point of importance is that the anastomosis should be made between equally movable portions of iâ€”2

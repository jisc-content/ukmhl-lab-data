Treatment after Abdominal Operations 147 obtainable, by several hot-water bottles placed inside at the commencement of the operation. Several fresh liot-water bottles also must be in readiness at the end of the opera- tion, so that they can be placed at the patient’s feet, and also at the side of his legs and body if any shock is present. These bottles must be covered with flannel, and placed outside the blanket covering the patient, and even then care must be taken that no part of the limbs remains in contact with them for any length of time, since burns very readily occur on the legs if hot-w'ater bottles are allowed to touch these parts during recovery from anaesthesia.

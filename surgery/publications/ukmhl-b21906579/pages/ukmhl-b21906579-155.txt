Preparations before Abdominal Operations 137 operation ; the ordinary pyjama sleeping-suits of flannel answer the purpose admirably, since the chest, limbs, and the lower part of the abdomen can be kept covered, while the upper part is exposed. In female patients flannel drawers, reaching as low as possible, and woollen stockings may take the place of the trousers, but the jacket can be used by both sexes. I may here remark that this clothing should always be of flannel, not of flannelette, since the latter material is of no use to keep in warmth. Some surgeons have the extremities ban- daged after being wrapped in cotton-wool, but this is not necessary. Greig Smith advised an ingenious device to prevent exposure during the operation. An ordinary blanket is torn in horizontal slips on each side, after the fashion of a many-tailed bandage, and is placed under the patient; the tails are crossed over the whole of the patientâ€™s body and legs, only leaving exposed the area to be operated on. The blanket, of course, is afterwards covered with mackintosh and sterilized towels. The next method of preventing shock is by the intro- duction of artificial serum, which is better known as normal saline solution. The simplest way of making this is by adding common salt to tepid boiled water in the proportion of one and a half teaspoonfuls to a pint. It can be introduced into the system in three ways : First, by intravenous injection, preferably into the median basilic vein (the mode most usually employed in this country) ; secondly, by subcutaneous injection, the fluid being forced by means of a glass syringe into the loose subcutaneous tissues in the region of the axilla ; and, thirdly, by means of small enemata frequently repeated. Either of these methods answers, but the last- named is likely to produce some irritability of the rectum and subsequent discomfort. The subcutaneous method

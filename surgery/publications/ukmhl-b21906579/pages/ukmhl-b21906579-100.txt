The operation may, however, sometimes be necessary as a temporary measure in cases of acute obstruction, when the patient is so Fig. 76.—Paul’s Tubes.

As a permanent measure it is occasionally called for in cases of extensive malignant disease of the pelvic region, where no anastomotic operation is possible. It is performed in the following way : A loop of distended intestine is brought out of the abdominal wound, and is compressed on each side by the fingers of an assistant or by clamps. A purse- string suture is then passed through all coats of the bowel round the place where it is proposed to make an opening. The opening is then made just the same length as the diameter of a small Paul’s tube, which is immediately

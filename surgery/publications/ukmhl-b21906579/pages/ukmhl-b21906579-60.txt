Intestinal Surgery 44 The united piece of gut is then turned over and a row of Lembert’s stitches inserted along the ridge raised by the guiding sutures. The two guides next to the mesentery (marked 4 in the figure) are then withdrawn, and two similar serous guides are inserted close to the mesentery on the other side of the gut (marked 3 in Fig. 44). Fig. 44.—End-to-End Anastomosis, showing the Method of Uniting the Portion of the Intestine within the Layers of the Mesentery. 3, Two Lembert’s sutures passed in corresponding points of the two ends close to the mesentery, but on the other side of the bowel to those marked 4 in the preceding figures. These are then clamped together with forceps. Another pair of forceps is placed on the long ends of the suture (No. 2) which had been inserted on the inside of the bowel, close to the mesentery. On holding apart these two forceps, the portions of the circumference of each piece of gut between the layers of the mesentery will be accurately held in apposition, and a row of interrupted

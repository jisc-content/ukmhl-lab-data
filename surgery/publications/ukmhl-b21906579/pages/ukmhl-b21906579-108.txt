92 Intestinal Surgery The piece of strangulated bowel and the apparently healthy gut on each side are then cut away together with its clamps. The ends of the gut are carefully cleaned with perchloride lotion, and can then be united either by interrupted sutures, by double continuous sutures over a bone bobbin, or by^ Maunsell’s method. In cases where time is of moment a Murphy’s button may be used. It must, however, be remembered that in cases of gangrenous herniae there is sure to be a considerable amount of dilatation of the gut above the obstruction, and probably ulceration of its mucous membrane, so that the application of the button is not so easy, and there is a risk of the pressure of the foreign body aggravating the ulceration, and so leading to perforation. 2. Internal Strangulation. — In cases of internal strangulation when the gut is gangrenous, it is always necessary to bring the gangrenous knuckle of intestine outside the abdomen, and then the condition of the patient will decide on the method of treatment to be adopted. If the patient is collapsed an opening should be made into the gut just above the gangrene, and a small Paul’s tube inserted in the same way as described for colotomy. It is unwise to remove the gangrenous gut, as this will separate of itself. The knuckle should be fixed to one angle of the incision by four or five sutures passing between the healthy gut, above and below the gangrene, and the parietal peritoneum; the rest of the wound is then closed, and the gangrenous knuckle dusted with iodoform. If the patient rallies from the operation the Paul’s tube and the gangrenous gut will separate within three or four days, and then we shall have an artificial anus to deal with. If the patient’s condition is good when the gangrenous bowel is brought outside the abdomen it may be excised, and treated by end-to-end anastomosis.

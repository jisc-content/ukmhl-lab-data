Operations on the Appendix Vermiformis 113 second gives more room, and should be employed when extensive adhesions are expected. (1) An incision between 2 and 3 inches long is made two fingersâ€™ breadth outside the edge of the right rectus muscle, the centre of the incision being opposite the anterior superior iliac spine. The aponeurosis of the external oblique is divided in the direction of this incision ; the external oblique will then be exposed, its fibres running transversely to those of the external oblique and to the abdominal incision. The fascia covering the muscle is divided in one of the white lines indicating the separation between the bundles of fibres, and these bundles are separated in the direction of the fibres ; this will expose the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle. The fibres of the internal oblique are forcibly held aside with re- tractors, and an incision in the same direction as the skin wound is made in the aponeurosis of the trans- versalis muscle, exposing the peritoneum. This is opened in the direction of the skin wound, and the caecum will usually present in the wound; this is shown in Fig. 84. Occasionally some adherent omentum is first seen, which must be ligatured. The caecum should be brought outside the wound until its junction with the ileum is seen. On searching further downwards, the origin of the appendix will probably be discovered ; if not, the finger must be introduced into the abdomen, and passed in front, below; and outside the caecum to search for the appendix. When it is found, it should be hooked up outside the wound, and recent adhesions separated with the finger. If the appendix cannot be found, or when found cannot be brought out of the wound, it is best to pull out a few inches of the termination of the ileum, and by drawing on this the caecum will usually be brought out of the wound; this will probably expose the

Treatment after Abdominal Operations 155 the peritoneal cavity, and by the absorption of its toxins therefrom. In order to guard against this condition, which arises from paralysis of the gut, as well as for other reasons, our aim must be to re-establish the normal peristaltic action as quickly as possible. The first means by which we attempt to do this is by the passage of a flatus tube about 4 or 5 inches up the rectum every four hours ; this enables the gas to be expelled by the enfeebled peristaltic contraction, which would otherwise not have sufficient force to conquer the resistance of the anal sphincter. Early feeding, too, will help our object, and hot fluids by the mouth, together with the avoidance of ice and of milk, are more conducive to the production of peristaltic action than starvation and ice. The most important point, however, is to obtain an early action of the bowels by means of an enema. This should be given on the second or third day after the operation, and may contain some purgative drug in addition ; a list of some of the purgative enemata is given below. Some surgeons recommend a purge as well—thus Spencer gives calomel on the second day—but I am inclined to rely first on the action of enemata, and to give a purge by the mouth only if the enemata are unsuccessful. In such a case I give 2 grains of calomel, followed by an ounce of mist, sennae co., or a pill containing calomel and colocynth, or an ounce of mist. mag. carb. with mag. sulph., to be repeated every two hours. In cases where aperient medicine cannot be given by the mouth in consequence of vomiting, and no result has followed a simple enema, we must rely upon the use of purgative enemata, the most useful of which are the following : 1. 01. ricini, turpentine, of each 1 ounce in 10 ounces of thin gruel. 2.

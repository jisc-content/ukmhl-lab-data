130 Intestinal Surgery- In the first method the sponges are freed from sand by frequent washing in water, then placed in water which is changed twice daily for a week. They are then placed in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, in which they remain for three or four days ; this dissolves out the remainder of sand and shell. They are then washed in frequent changes of water, and are placed in a strong solution of washing-soda for twenty-four hours ; this solution should contain i pound of washing soda for every twelve sponges. They are then washed in frequent changes of water, and either dried by heat or put in a glass jar containing i in 20 carbolic solution. The second method is recommended by Lockwood. First thoroughly beat and shake the sponges to remove the sand, then soak for twenty-four hours in a solution of hydrochloric acid in water (1 drachm to the pint), which will remove bits of coral and shell. They are then washed in boiled water which has been allowed to cool to ioo° F. in a covered vessel ; from this they are placed in a warm solution of washing-soda (1 drachm to 1 pint of water), and are allowed to remain for half an hour to remove fat and albumin ; they are then washed out in warm sterilized water, and put into a cold solution of sulphurous acid (1 in 5) for twelve hours. This insures sterilization and bleaching. A plate should be placed over the sponges to keep them at the bottom of the receptacle during bleach- ing, so as to prevent discolourization. They are then washed out in sterilized water, and squeezed as dry as possible, after which they are placed in 1 in 20 carbolic solution, and remain there until they are wanted. When required for intra-abdominal use, care should be taken to remove the carbolic acid, which is best effected by wringing the sponges out in sterilized saline solution. The next method is Borham’s method, and this is

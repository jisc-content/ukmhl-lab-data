If the needle is pressed steadily towards the lumen, and when the resist- ance is felt it be lateralized, and pushed on so as to emerge from the serous coat again, the point will pick up some fibres of the submucous coat. Halsted employs a double stitch, called a mattress suture, so as to bring a larger amount of serous surface in apposition. The Fig. 11.— Halsted’s Mattress Suture. (L. Mark.) needle is made to enter ^ inch and to come out at x\ inch from the edge, then to enter T\ inch from and to emerge | inch from the opposite edge ; it is then reinserted -} inch away from the point of exit, and passed in the same way through both edges. Each stitch should be f inch apart, and the row should be parallel and equidistant (see Fig. 11). In order to insure this, it is best to pass the whole row of sutures and clamp their ends before tying any. This stitch is the ideal one, since it does not perforate the mucous membrane, and yet it is absolutely strong, and

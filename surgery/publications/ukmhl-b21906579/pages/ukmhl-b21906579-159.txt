Jessett recommends that the skin of the abdomen should be scrubbed twice a day for two days with a 10 per cent, solution of liquor potassae, and a pad soaked in 1 in 3,000 sublimate solu- tion applied after each cleansing. Finally, we must not forget the hygiene of the mouth, since a septic condition of this part may affect a wound of the stomach or intestine, by the swallowing of pus with saliva. Not only should carious, useless teeth be removed or stopped, and the teeth carefully cleaned with antiseptic tooth-powder twice a day, but an antiseptic mouth-wash should be employed each time after taking food.

27 Lateral Anastomosis mosis atrophies at once. The longer distance, however, makes the operation of occluding the ends easier. The management of the mesentery in lateral anasto- mosis does not present any difficulty, since it is not near the line of union. If the operation is simply a short- circuiting one and not accompanied by occlusion, the mesentery will not be touched, but if it be performed in the course of a resection of the bowel, the mesentery should Fig. 24.â€”Occlusion of Intestine.

On one side the purse-string suture has been passed, and on the other it has been tied, puckering up the end. be ligatured close to the portion of bowel removed ; and when the anastomosis is complete, the parts of the mesen- tery which lie over one another should be united with a few points of suture. In cases where occlusion is necessary after lateral anastomosis, the bowel is divided between clamps about 3 inches from the anastomosis, and each end is closed. This may be done by two rows of sutures as directed for

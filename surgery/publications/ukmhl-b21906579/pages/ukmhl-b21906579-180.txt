162 , Intestinal Surgery the cavity; it is best avoided by thorough and prolonged drainage. There are two other points which require notice : the first is the administration of morphia, and the second is the admission of visitors. Many surgeons have a great prejudice against the use of morphia hypodermically during the first days after an operation, because it often produces persistent vomit- ing and delay in the re - establishment of peristaltic action, and consequently pseudo-ileus and adhesions. Other surgeons, especially Spencer, to whom I have referred before, make a rule of giving morphia and atropine every three hours or so, so as to prevent vomiting. I should advise a middle course, and I usually give one hypodermic injection of from Â£ to \ grain of morphia combined with atropine on the night following the opera- tion, since I think that a bad night does far more harm than the morphia. Morphia certainly has a depressing effect, so I do not give another injection until I have evidence of the re-establishment of peristaltic action in the intestines as shown by the passage of flatus per rectum. In some cases morphia undoubtedly increases the tendency to and duration of vomiting, but this passes off if no more is given, and, if not excessive, even vomiting is preferable to severe pain and want of sleep. With regard to visitors, after any serious abdominal operation no one should be allowed to see the patient during the first forty-eight hours under any circum- stances, except where the case is apparently hopeless. With an unexcitable patient the nearest relative, if a sensible person, may just see him for two or three minutes on the third day, and have a short talk on the following day ; not more than one person at a time, however, should be admitted during the first week.

Preparations before Abdominal Operations 129 being most popular. Personally, I prefer a 1 in 60 carbolic solution ; nothing stronger than this should be used, since the peritoneum would be injured by intro- ducing even a small amount of strong carbolic lotion. To absolutely prevent injury to the peritoneum, some surgeons use their instruments dry, or put them in sterilized normal saline solution ; the latter method is of course, ideal, but does not prevent the growth of any bacteria which may fall into it, or have settled on the instruments. Dry instruments are inconvenient when they have once been used, since blood will become clotted on them. Sponges.â€”The preparation of sponges, or of the materials to be used in their place, is of prime importance. For intra-abdominal work it is necessary to use some material the particles of which will not be left behind in the abdominal cavity ; thus, ordinary cotton-wool made into swabs should never be employed. Marine sponges, if properly prepared, are excellent, but so also are sponge- cloths, or wool swabs wrapped and tied up in gauze, both of which must be sterilized by heat before use. The thorough preparation of sponges is of so much importance that in serious cases it should be undertaken by the surgeon himself or by someone under his superintendence, and not entrusted to chance ; personally, I would never use the sponges prepared in a shop for an abdominal operation. The sponge should first be carefully selected. It is best to have one or two large flat sponges to cover exposed viscera, two or three small flat ones to pack round the part, and, finally, six or a dozen round sponges for swabbing. They should be soft, of very fine texture, elastic, and compressible. There are several methods of preparing them ; I shall refer to three. 9

24 Intestinal Surgery ^ 3. As the incision of the bowel is made at some distance from the mesentery, the bleeding is slight, and practically no ligatures are required to stop haemorrhage. 3. It is easy to perform, especially if Halstedâ€™s method be employed, since in this case the sutures are introduced before the bowel collapses. 4. The avoidance of the mesenteric border of the bowel in this anastomosis obviates any risk of extravasation. 5. The opening can be made of a considerable length, and, as it does not contract very much, there is little likelihood of stricture resulting. The disadvantages are : 1. The intestinal contents may not go through the new opening. This difficulty can be obviated by occluding the bowel beyond the anastomosis, so as to divert the whole of the contents through the new opening ; this involves suture of two ends of bowel. 2. The length of time occupied in the performance of this triple operation is greater than in a simple end-to-end anastomosis. 3. The opening is not in the direct axis of the intestine, although it tends to become so after a time. 4. No special apparatus can be profitably used in lateral anastomoses, since either a bobbin or a button seems to prevent any passage through the opening so long as it remains in position. 5. Rather more bowel is cut off from the general circuit. On the other hand, the advantages of end-to-end anastomoses are : 1. The two pieces of intestine are united in a direct line. 2. It is the most economical of bowel. 3. Buttons and bobbins can be employed when time is of extreme importance.

Special Operations 75 On the other hand, the advantages of the posterior operation are : 1. The ready passage of stomach contents through the new opening when the patient is in bed. 2. The absence of any danger of constriction of the transverse colon by the loop of jejunum. 3. The absence of risk of a kink in the jejunum beyond the anastomosis. The disadvantages are : 1. The greater difficulty in its performance, the necessary exposure of the transverse colon during the operation, and the increased shock. 2. The greater difficulty in attaching the jejunum in a proper direction to the stomach. 3. As the jejunum is attached to the middle of the posterior surface of the stomach, and the point of union is fixed to the hole in the transverse colon, the anastomosis cannot change its position when the patient stands up, and in the erect position the new opening is no longer at the most dependent part of the stomach. 4. The risk of hernia through the opening in the trans- verse mesocolon. It will be seen that there is a great deal to be said for and against each procedure, and that neither is vastly superior to the other. Personally, I should recom- mend the anterior operation to a surgeon who had not done many cases, and leave the posterior operation to those who have had a large experience. My own practice has been to do a posterior operation in cases of obstruction from non-malignant stricture when the patientâ€™s general condition is good, and to do the anterior operation in cases of malignant disease and in non-malignant cases who are in a feeble condition.

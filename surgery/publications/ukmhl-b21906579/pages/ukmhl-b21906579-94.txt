78 Intestinal Surgery I have found it necessary to perform a gastro-enterostomy on a subsequent occasion. The risk of the operation in non-malignant cases is very slight. 2. Pyloreetomy.â€”This is a very severe operation, and should be exclusively reserved for cases of malignant disease. Unfortunately, only a very few cases of cancer of the pylorus are capable of removal, since, by the time that a tumour can be felt through the abdominal wall, it is probably of such a size and is accompanied by such extensive secondary infection that removal is impossible. When, however, a growth is freely movable, and the enlargement of the glands does not extend too deeply, removal is certainly indicated, since, even if recurrence occur, life will be prolonged for a longer time than after simple gastro-enterostomy. The operation presents two chief difficulties : (i) The cut ends of the stomach and of the duodenum are of such a different size that union between the two is very difficult, and there is always a considerable risk of extravasation at the point where the suturing of the stomach, necessary to reduce the size of the opening to that of the duodenum, joins the actual anastomosis. Moreover, if any amount of duodenum be removed with the growth, the remaining portion will only partially be surrounded by peritoneum. (2) Another difficulty lies in the fact that the duodenum is a fixed organ and the stomach a movable one, so they are not suitable for uniting together. To obviate the difficulty of uniting the small orifice of the duodenum to the large opening in the stomach, Kocher has recommended that the opening in the stomach should be completely closed with a double row of sutures, and that the end of the duodenum should then be implanted into the posterior surface of the stomach about 1 inch from the cut end. This, however,

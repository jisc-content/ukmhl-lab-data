9 Clamps notch fits on the blunt point, and when the cap is in position the elastic ring is stretched over the whole. It is applied by passing the blunt point through the mesentery close to the gut, and then applying the small cap with the elastic band attached, so that the gut is compressed between the elastic band and the rod. It is very simple and inexpensive, and two of them are useful. The application of this clamp is seen in Fig. 42. Still, however, the most important thing is to be able to clamp the gut without any special apparatus, and the following two methods are very simple and efficacious : 1. A fine pair of Spencer Wells forceps is passed Fig. 4.—Lane’s Intestinal Clamp. (Down Bros.) through the mesentery close to the gut, and about 6 inches of a small-size rubber tubing (sterilized) is drawn through the hole, and the two ends of the tubing tied lightly together over the gut, with just sufficient force to obliter- ate the canal ; the knot, which is a single one, is prevented from slipping by applying a pair of Spencer Wells forceps as shown in Fig. 5. The constriction is easily removed by taking off the forceps. I have used this method in a number of cases, and have found it absolutely satis- factory. The constricting tubing cannot slip, as it is passed through the mesentery. 2. Maunsell’s method, which consists of a piece of sponge and a safety-pin, both of which are easily steri-

136 Intestinal Surgery disposes to shock and limits absorption, metabolism, and excretion. Under this heading, too, must be considered, the question of trying to asepticize the intestinal canal by administering antiseptics by the mouth for some days previously. The antiseptics usually employed are salol or beta naphthol ; the former can be given in 5-grain doses three or four times a day, and the latter in 3- to 5-grain doses in a cachet. Though these substances undoubtedly have the power of destroying a certain number of micro-organisms in the intestinal tract, yet they apparently disturb the normal assimilation of intestinal products, in which possibly bacteria play some role, so it is doubtful whether their exhibition is of any real practical use. When, however, it is decided to employ them, they should be given three or four times a day for several days before the operation. With regard to feeding before intestinal operations, a fair amount of food may be taken by the mouth up to the day of the operation, taking care, however, for the last twenty-four hours to give chiefly peptones and foods which leave little residue, together with alcohol or wine. It is not advisable to withhold food and give only nutrient enemata, but in an exhausted patient it is desirable to administer, shortly before the operation, an enema containing some peptone, and also \ ounce of brandy, or a large saline enema. The next points in the preparation of a patient are those directed towards diminishing the post-operative shock. But first among these is the prevention of unnecessary loss of heat. To accomplish this end the patient should be warmly clad, and in such a way that no large surface of the body is exposed during the

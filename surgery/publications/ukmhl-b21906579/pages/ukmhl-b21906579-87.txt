7i Special Operations flow of bile; (3) that no spiral twist takes place in the jejunum when the stomach is replaced within the abdo- men ; and (4) that the margins of the hole in the meso- colon are united to the stomach so as to avoid the danger of a hernia of small intestine through it : such a condition has occurred, and proved fatal. One of the causes of failure after gastro-enterostomy has been the establishment of the so-called ‘ vicious circle.’ This consists in the passage of the food into the afferent loop of the jejunum, and consequent return of the food mingled with bile into the stomach ; this natu- ally gives rise to intractable vomiting and starvation. In order to obviate this, I have laid stress on the import- ance of attaching the jejunum in a slanting direction, and to unite the jejunum to the stomach for \ inch beyond the ends of the anastomosis, and this in my hands has prevented the accident in all but one case ; some other surgeons seem to have been very unfortunate, and the condition is described as being of fairly fre- quent occurrence. To correct the condition, all that is necessary is to do a lateral anastomosis between the afferent and efferent loops below the anastomosis, when the food and bile will pass onwards in the proper way instead of returning to the stomach. This is shown in Fig. 70, which also represents a rather faulty gastro- enterostomy. The anastomosis can be done by Halsted’s method, by a double row of continuous sutures, or by Murphy’s button, if time is of consequence. In order to prevent the possibility of the establishment of a vicious circle, various operations have been devised, but I will only refer to one which has been invented by Roux, of Lausanne. This, however, is a more severe operation, and will take a longer time to perform. The posterior surface of the stomach is exposed in the usual way, and

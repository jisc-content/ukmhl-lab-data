EncUtoEnd Anastomosis 61 When the gut is completely encircled with the suture, one half of the button is held by a pair of artery forceps, and inserted sideways into the opening; when the button is within the lumen of the gut, the running stitch is tightened and tied, any redundant mucous membrane is then snipped off, the end of the gut being tucked within the button with a pair of dissecting forceps. The other half of the button is inserted into the other piece of gut in a similar way, and the running stitch is tightened. Before bringing the two halves of the button Fig. 62.â€”Both Halves of Button in Position, Mesenteric Stitch passed. (After Gould and Warren.) together it is well to insert a stitch in the edge of the mesentery at each end, which insures accurate contact at this point when the button is approximated ; this is shown in Fig. 62. The two halves of the button must be pushed together very gently, and it must be remembered that it is impossible to rectify any mistake in position when once the button has been closed up ; the only way is to cut it out of the intestine and start afresh. The two halves do not require to be absolutely jammed together, since it is best that the actual contact of the intestinal walls should be maintained by the action of

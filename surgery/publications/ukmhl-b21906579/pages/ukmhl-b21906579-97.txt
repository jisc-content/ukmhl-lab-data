81 6 CHAPTER V SPECIAL OPERATIONS (continued) Operations on the Large and Small Intestines i. Ileo-Colostomy.â€”The ileum may be united either to the movable caput caeci, to the transverse colon, or to the sigmoid. The operation is required in cancer of the caecum or colon, which does not admit of removal, in the case of an artificial anus of the small intestine or colon, in cases of volvulus of the sigmoid, and in some cases of ulcerative colitis. In this operation care must be taken to select a loop of the ileum close to the caecum ; this is found by passing the finger down to the caecum, and picking up the nearest coil of small intestine. This should then be brought out of the wound, and the end nearer to the caecum should be pulled upon till no more gut comes out, when it will be known that the last part of the ileum has been reached. The lower portion of the ileum can also be recognised by the absence of valvulae conniventes in this portion. Looking out for these, which can be felt and seen through the intestinal wall, will obviate the risk of attaching the jejunum to the sigmoid. Having found out the lower part of the ileum, the coil is slackened so as to select a part about 6 or 7 inches from the caecum ; this distance is necessary so as to avoid any dragging on the .anastomosis. Care must also be taken to unite the ileum

Intestinal Surgery- 98 continued above or below it for about 2 inches; the peri- toneum opened at the extreme end of the incision, and the adherent knuckle of gut carefully freed from the abdo- minal wall. The part is then examined, and the amount of loss of substance of the wall of the gut is estimated, and also the amount of contraction which would be caused by suturing the wound left after dissecting out the artificial anus. This will usually be very considerable, and so such a method of treatment will be out of the question. It will therefore be necessary to do some resection. The bowel must be clamped above and below the artificial anus, leaving at least 3 inches of healthy bowel on each side between the clamps and the opening. The bowel is then divided on each side of and close to the artificial anus, and the knuckle of gut containing the artificial anus removed after tying the vessels in the mesentery. The two ends are then united by any of the methods described, such as Maunsell’s, or over a bone bobbin. (2) In the second method there is less disturbance of the parts, and less risk of fouling the peritoneal cavity, than in the former. The method consists in first purify- ing the artificial anus, and inserting a plug and sewing the mucous membrane over it, then making an incision into the abdomen about 1 inch to one side of the artificial anus, and opening the peritoneum. The loops of gut going to and coming from the artificial anus are then identified, and a lateral anastomosis is made between these about 3 inches from the opening. The lateral anastomosis is best made by Halsted’s method. The afferent portion of gut between the anastomosis and the artificial anus is then occluded by dividing it as described on p. 27. It is not necessary to occlude the portion of the bowel on the distal side of the artificial

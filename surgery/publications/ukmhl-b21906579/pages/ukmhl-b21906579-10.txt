VI Preface Mr. A. Baldwin, to whose artistic illustrations much of the usefulness of the book will be due. I have to acknow- ledge the courtesy of my friend Mr. Watson Cheyne, and of Messrs. W. B. Saunders and Co., who have kindly allowed me to copy the diagrams which bear their names. I have also to thank Dr. Maunsell, Mr. Jessett, and Messrs. Down Bros, for the loan of a number of blocks. The last two chapters on the preparation before and the treatment after operations are lectures delivered at the Post-Graduate College, and were originally published in the Clinical Journal. L. A. BIDWELL. Upper Wimpole Street, W. May, 1905.

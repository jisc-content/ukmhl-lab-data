General Considerations 7 wet silk, and I had to sterilize the silk and needles together after threading—an undesirable proceeding, since the loop of silk within the needle is liable to become rotten by development of a little rust in the eye of the needle during boiling. Again, if a needle comes unthreaded in a continuous suture, it is instantly rethreaded in the case of a calyx-eyed needle. These needles have a spring eye, as shown in Fig. 2. They are threaded by simply passing a piece of silk over the end. Straight needles are most useful in picking up the Fig. 2.—Straight and Curved Intestinal Needles, with ‘ Calyx ’ Eye (Enlarged Sketch of Calyx Eye). (Down Bros.) submucous coat, since they are driven in with the pulp of the finger, and when used in this way it is easy to recognise the resistance of the different coats. Curved needles, which must also be made round, are useful for continuous sutures, especially when an anasto- mosis is performed within the abdominal cavity, when straight needles could not be used so easily. I strongly advise those made with calyx eyes to be used, since it is practically impossible to thread the intestinal needles supplied by some instrument makers. The ordinary full-curved needle is the best shape, and the semicircular

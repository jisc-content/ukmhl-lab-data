Preparations before Abdominal Operations 131 specially recommended for cleaning sponges after use. The sponges, after removal of sand by washing, are soaked in a 1 per cent, solution of permanganate of potash, which is afterwards washed out by repeated washing and squeezing. They are then placed in a disinfecting fluid, which is prepared by dissolving \ pound of sodium hyposulphite in a gallon of water, and adding 4 ounces of oxalic acid ; sulphur dioxide is then formed in the meshes of the sponges, and acts as a powerful disinfec- tant, as well as bleaching and removing fibrin. The sponges should not be allowed to remain longer than ten minutes in this solution, lest they should become rotten. They are then washed out thoroughly in several changes of water, and are either dried or put into 1 in 20 carbolic solution to remain till required. This method takes much less time than the former. Another simple and usual method of cleaning sponges which have not been used for any septic cases is to first thoroughly wash out in plain water, then soak in several changes of soda solution for a couple of days, after which the soda is thoroughly washed out in water, and the sponges squeezed dry and put in 1 in 20 carbolic solution. The use of marine sponges is all right in a hospital where a special set is kept for abdominal operations, or for a surgeon who is constantly doing this class of surgery ; but, as shown above, their proper preparation requires a considerable amount of time and trouble ; they therefore, probably, would not be available when wanted. For this reason, some more easily prepared material is preferable. Absorbent cotton material is now almost universally employed, and the great advantage of its use is that it canjbe sterilized by heat. Various forms can be used. Soft square sponge-cloths of an open texture, which can be obtained from an ordinary draper, are recommended by 9â€”2

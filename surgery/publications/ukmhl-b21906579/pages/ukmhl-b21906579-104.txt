88 Intestinal Surgery an opening' into the bowel at once ; before this is done a stout silk ligature is passed through the hole in the mesosigmoid, and then an opening is made into the centre of the loop of intestine. A large-sized Paul’s tube is then inserted into this opening, and the silk ligature is tied tightly round the flange of the tube, strangulating the whole of the circumference of the bowel and the vessels of the mesosigmoid. At the same time another stout silk ligature is passed through the hole in the meso- Fig. 79.—Colotomy. (A. Baldwin.) The skin has been united within the hole torn in the mesosigmoid. The two stout silk ligatures passed round the sigmoid are used for tying in the Paul’s tube. sigmoid, and the distal end of the sigmoid is tied tightly with this, so as to strangulate it. The loop of gut between the ligature and the part where the glass tube is tied in will slough away at the end of a few days, and the tube will fall out, leaving the openings completely separated by a bridge of skin, and flush with the abdominal wall. In chronic cases, where it is not desired to open the bowel at the time of the operation, the two stout ligatures are passed through the hole in the mesosigmoid, and the

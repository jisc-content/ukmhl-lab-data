Treatment after Abdominal Operations 153 chicken immediately afterwards. This, of course, is for an uncomplicated case. It will be interesting to briefly refer to methods of feed- ing serious stomach cases recommended by other surgeons. MM. Terrier and Hartman’s directions are as follows : The subcutaneous injection of saline solution is to be carried out during the first twenty-four hours, and longer if necessary, and in severe cases it is continued for five days, from 600 to 2,000 grammes being injected each day. Nutrient enemata are given for the first twenty- four hours, and in severe cases for as long as twelve days. If there be no sickness on the day after the operation the patient can have champagne or brandy- and-water by the mouth ; they give peptones and milk on the fourth or fifth day, then eggs, and on the seventh day calves’ brains, after which fish or chicken is allowed. Stimulants.—In most cases stimulants will be required from the first day ; it is usual to add some brandy (2 drachms) to each nutrient enema on the day of the operation, and if the general condition of the patient is good no further stimulant will be required till the third or fourth day, when solids are given by the mouth ; then a little champagne with the principal meal is indi- cated. In a case where there is considerable shock, however, stimulants must be pushed earlier, and in deciding upon this point, and also on the quantity to be given, I am guided by the pulse. A rapid pulse demands stimulants, and if necessary they may be pushed to a very large amount ; thus I have kept a patient alive for a month after a serious operation by giving each day 16 ounces of brandy and 18 ounces of champagne. Some surgeons, as a routine, commence on the evening of the operation by giving iced champagne or iced brandy-and- water ; the former, however, does not seem to be desirable

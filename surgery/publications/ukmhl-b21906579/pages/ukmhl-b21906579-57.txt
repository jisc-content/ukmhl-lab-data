EncUtoEnd Anastomosis 4i between the two ends. Maunsell recommends that the needle should be passed through both sides of the anastomosis—i.e., through all the four thicknesses of gut—and the loop of silk picked up in the centre, thus passing two sutures in one. I do not, however, recom- mend this, as there is a risk of not picking up one of the walls of the intestine, and one cannot be so certain of preventing eversion of the mucous membrane. More- over, the manoeuvre is not easy with collapsed intestine. Fig. 40.—Maunsell’s Method. (Maunsell.) The needle is being passed through both sides of both pieces of bowel. After all the sutures have been passed and tied, the gut is pulled out straight, and the peritoneal surface of the line of sutures is examined carefully to see if the suturing is perfect. If any mucous membrane is seen, it is snipped off, and a Lembert suture is passed over the spot. In order to make the union more secure, I pass a row of Lembert’s sutures all round the anastomosis, but this has the effect of producing some narrowing of the opening. It now only remains to close the incision in the in-

Intestinal Surgery 62 the spring. When the button is closed the mesenteric stitch is tied, and one or two stitches uniting the mesentery complete the operation. Some surgeons have recom- mended a supporting row of Lembertâ€™s sutures, but Murphy himself was very adverse to this as being un- necessary, and, moreover, as acting as a hindrance to the passage onwards of the button, and likely to cause a valve-like obstruction at the line of union after the button was passed. This is a method that everyone should be familiar with, and though its application seems very simple in a book, it requires some care and practice to insure that no mucous membrane overlaps the serous when the button is closed ; this, of course, would lead to failure of union and extravasation. The button separates by means of necrosis of the opposed pieces of gut, and it usually takes about ten days to pass down the intestinal canal. In some cases it has been retained for as long as forty days, and in most cases of gastro-enterostomy it remains permanently in the stomach. The indication for the employment of the button is the necessity for the rapid termination of an operation.

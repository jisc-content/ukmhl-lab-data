Preparations before Abdominal Operations i39 duces a good deal of irritation at the site of the injection, and therefore is not suitable, but an aseptic non- irritating fluid extract called ergone, which is made by Parke, Davis and Co., is of the same strength as the fluid extract, and is very suitable. It is recommended to give 30 minims hypodermically twenty-four hours before the operation, and to repeat the dose every eight hours for three days. The advantages claimed for the use of this drug are : (1) There is less post-operative nausea and vomiting and general shock ; (2) tympanites does not occur, as the ergot causes contraction of the involun- tary fibres of the intestine ; (3) it relieves pain almost as efficiently as morphia, or if pain be not relieved a very small dose of morphia will be efficaciousâ€”it, moreover, produces a nerve calmness ; (4) the bowels are opened with greater ease in cases where ergot has been given, in some cases no aperient being necessary. The method seems worthy of consideration, especially as it is devoid of risk. It only now remains to speak of the employment of morphia hypodermically, either alone or combined with atropine, or the latter drug alone. The use of atropine, I believe, is harmless, but I do not think that a pre- liminary injection of morphia is absolutely safe, although it certainly enables the patient to be kept unconscious with a smaller amount of anaesthetic ; the ultimate shock, however, will be greater. The preparation of the skin demands the utmost attention, especially where portions of the intestine may accidentally rest outside the wound in such operations as posterior gastro-enterostomy and other anastomoses. There are many modifications in the method of preparing the skin, the object of each being to render it as nearly aseptic as possible. The asepsis of the skin will not in

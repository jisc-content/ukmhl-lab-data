Preparations before Abdominal Operations 143 Owing to the difficulty in rendering the hands sterile, several surgeons have recommended and used gloves during operations. These gloves in aseptic cases are of rubber, cotton, or fine silk ; they are sterilized before use by boiling, and are soaked in antiseptic solution after being put on. In septic cases indiarubber gloves must be used, and, personally, I reserve their use lor such cases, since the interference with the acuteness of the sense of touch in the fingers will not insure the rapid performance of an intestinal suture, and in passing stitches according to Halstedâ€™s method, when the needle is pushed in by the pulp of the index-finger, the end of the needle would probably constantly catch in the gloves.

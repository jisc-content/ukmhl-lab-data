120 Intestinal Surgery that to facilitate the accurate closure of the wound after the operation, the skin should be dissected off the rectus sheath for i inch on each side. The anterior sheath of the rectus is then incised along the whole length of the wound, and the fibres of the rectus muscle are then separated with the handle of a scalpel; of course, if a tendinous inter- section occurs in the length of the wound, this will have to be divided with a scalpel. The fibres of the rectus are then held apart with retractors, and the posterior sheath of the rectus is exposed ; this is divided slightly to one side of the incision in the anterior sheath, as shown in Fig. 89, and the peritoneum exposed. This is picked up with dissecting or rat’s-tooth forceps, and an opening Fig. 89.—Incision through Rectus Sheath, showing the Division of the Skin, Anterior and Posterior Sheath of the Rectus in Different Horizontal Planes. (A Baldwin.) made in the portion picked up. In doing this, it is best to hold the scalpel in a lateral position, so as to avoid any risk of injuring the omentum or intestine. When a small opening has been made in the peritoneum, the edges are caught up with a couple of pairs of forceps, and these are held up in the wound so as to separate the peritoneum from the parts below. The peritoneum is then divided with scissors along the whole length of the wound. If the omentum is difficult to keep out of the way, a finger may be introduced through the wound to prevent the scissors injuring it. The use of a director is not to be encouraged. In order to prevent the wound from becoming con-

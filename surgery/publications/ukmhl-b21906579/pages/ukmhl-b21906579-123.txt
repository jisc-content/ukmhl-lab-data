107 Special Operations as before described. In an acute case it is inadvisable to attempt any anastomosis operation until the bowels have recovered from the effect of the obstruction. Subse- quently either an ileo-sigmoidostomy is done, or the intes- tinal canal is restored by the use of an enterotome. If the growth be immovable, and it be possible to pick up a loop of sigmoid below it, an ileo-sigmoidostomy should be performed at once and a drainage-tube tied into the anus, so as to insure escape of faecal contents. It is only when the growth is fixed in the pelvis and there is no free gut below it that a colotomy should be done ; it is an opera- tion that is to be avoided if possible. When it is done, an opening should be made into the loop of bowel at the time and a Paul’s tube tied in, since it is most important to relieve the obstruction at once, and if the faeces be conducted away from the wound by means of the Paul’s tube no harm will result. If the sigmoid be found to be empty, I turn immediately to the caecum and examine this ; if the growth be not seated in the caecum, by tracing the distended gut upwards the growth will be found. Wherever the giowth is found and it is movable an incision should be made over it, and it should be treated in the same way as I have ^escribed for the sigmoid. After removal of the growth, and the patient has recovered from the effect of the obstruction, it is best to do an ileo-sigmoidostomy rather than to unite the ileum to the transverse colon or to attempt to restore the canal by means of an enterotome. Anastomosis operations performed during acute ob- struction have not the same freedom from risk as those performed during the quiescent period, and so should not be performed except in cases where the growth is not removable.

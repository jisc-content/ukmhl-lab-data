In cases, however, where the mesentery is sufficiently long to enable one to bring the two cut ends of bowel outside the abdominal incision, the operation can be much simpli- fied by leaving the whole of the peritoneal suture until after the bobbin has been placed in position. The two pieces of intestine are held in apposition, and a con- tinuous suture is made to unite all the coats of the mesen- teric half of each portion of intestine ; the bobbin is inserted and held in position while this suture is com- Fig. 56.—Allingham’s Bone Bobbin.

A continuous sero-muscular suture is then inserted all round the anastomosis, starting near the convex border, and paying particular attention to the inclusion of a sufficient amount of mesentery in the stitch. Alling’ham's Bobbin.—Most surgeons use Allingham’s bobbin in exactly the same way as has been described for the application of Mayo Robson’s, and it acts equally well. The inventor himself advocates an easier and quicker method of employing it. A purse-string suture is inserted round the end of each piece of gut in the same way as is done before the introduction of a Murphy’s button (see p. 60). The bobbin is then

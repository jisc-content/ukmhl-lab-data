End'toEnd Anastomosis 37 to the root of the mesentery. It is used only in cases of cancer or of gangrene. The second method consists in dividing the mesentery close to and parallel to the loop to be removed, and tying the bleeding - points. When the anastomosis is complete this will leave a re- dundant fold of mesentery, which must be sewn down upon itself with a continuous suture, so as to avoid leaving a hole through which a loop of gut might pass and become strangulated. The second consideration is to avoid cicatricial con- Fig. 35.â€”Management of the Mesentery. (After Cheyne.) The edge of the redundant portion of the mesentery has been closed with a continuous suture, and is then to be sewn down to the mesentery beneath it. traction of the new opening. This is minimized by dividing the gut obliquely so as to remove about \ inch more of the convex than of the mesenteric border ; this, of course, leaves a much wider line to be sutured, and so lessens contraction. It, moreover, has the advantage of removing the portion of the intestinal circumference which is furthest removed from the blood-supply, and so would be most likely to slough (see Fig. 36).

Intestinal Surgery- 5^ introduced into the opening of one piece of gut, and the opening in the other piece of gut is drawn over the other end of the bobbin. The purse-string sutures are then tied tightly round each piece of gut, fixing it on to the bobbin, whose gutter-like shape will prevent the gut from slipping off (see Fig. 57). The two portions of gut are now united by some interrupted serous sutures, or by a Fig. 57.—Allingham’s Bone Bobbin in Position. (Allingham.) continuous suture taking up the serous and muscular coats. It will be seen that this method is very easy to perform, but it is liable to be followed by considerable contraction, since not only has each end been constricted by the purse-string sutures, but the continuous serous suture will be at some distance from the line of union, and so will cause a good deal of valvular projection within Fig. 58.—Landerer’s Potato Bobbin. (Gould and Warren.) the lumen of the gut at this point. The method should only be used in a case where extreme haste is necessary. Landerer’s Potato Bobbin consists of a piece of raw potato, which is cut into the shape shown in Fig. 58. It is used in precisely the same way as Allingham’s bobbin. It will not be so readily absorbed as decalcified bone.

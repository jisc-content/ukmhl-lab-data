PREFACE This little volume aims at giving such a precise descrip- tion of the commoner intestinal sutures that an inex- perienced surgeon may readily practise the various methods on dead intestine before performing an anasto- mosis on the living subject. The book owes its origin to the establishment of a class in intestinal surgery at the West London Post- graduate College, and it contains a full description of the work done in this class. The material which I use for these classes is the small intestine of bullocks, which I am fortunate enough to obtain the day the animal is killed. Bullockâ€™s intestine is of practically the same thick- ness as that of man, and if used quite fresh resembles to the touch and in resistance the intestine of a living man much more closely than does human intestine removed in the post-mortem room. It, moreover, has the advantage of being odourless and of not soiling the hands. In order to enable an anastomosis to be performed single-handed, each student is provided with a little intestine holder, which is figured on p. 43, and takes the place of a first- rate assistant. In such a book, with the aid of which, it is hoped, the student may dispense with class teaching, numerous and clear illustrations are of the first impor- tance, and I have been very fortunate in obtaining the assistance of Dr. Leonard Mark and of my colleague,

116 Intestinal Surgery the ligature and is taken away. The stump is touched with some pure carbolic acid applied with a small wisp of wool on a match, the end of the ligature is cut short, the cuff is brought forward, and two silk sutures are inserted to unite its edge. The stump now requires to be invaginated into the caecum, and to do this two or three Lembert stitches are inserted into the caecum h inch from the edge of the appendix; when these are tied the appendix will be invaginated, as shown in Fig. 87. (N.B.—The suture nearest to the meso-appendix must be tied first.) The appearance of the invaginated stump as seen in section through the caecum is shown in Fig. 88. Fig. 87.—Removal of Appendix. View of Stump after Invagination. (A. Baldwin.) Some warm saline solution should now be run over the caecum and the scar of the appendix, and the parts should be reduced into the abdominal cavity. The wound must now be very carefully closed. In uniting the peritoneum, the omentum will often be found to give some trouble, as it has a great tendency to get in the way ; I find, however, that this difficulty can be avoided by catching hold of the edges of the peri- toneum at the two ends of the incision with four pairs of Spencer Wells forceps, and holding them up so as to

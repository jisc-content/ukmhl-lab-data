It is then tied to the end left at the commencement of the stitch, and its knot tucked inside the mucous membrane. The bobbin will now be firmly fixed in position, and as there can be no further risk of any faecal escape, the clamps should be removed. The needle used for the first suture—i.e., that uniting the serous coats only—is taken Fig. 55.—Mayo Robson’s Bobbin in Position, the Sutures Completed.

The knot of suture 2 should be tucked inside the bowel. up again, and with it the continuous Lembert’s stitch is carried completely round the anastomosis covering, in the inner or penetrating suture. When the point of the commencement of this suture is reached it is tied to the end which had previously been left long ; the anastomosis is then complete. If a straight needle be used, it will be found easier to employ a continuous Cushing stitch rather than a Lembert. This method, it will be seen, is not very easy, on account

Intestinal Surgery *34 The following are the best methods of its preparation : The first is Esmarchâ€™s method, which consists in vigorously scrubbing ordinary commercial catgut with soft soap and a brush ; after washing in water it is wound on glass reels or slides, and then placed in a i in ioo solution of perchloride of mercury for twelve hours. It is then put in a i in 200 solution of perchloride of mercury in alcohol for another twelve hours, and preserved dry in closely- stoppered bottles. Before use it is laid in a solution of 1 in 2,000 of perchloride of mercury in alcohol. This method, according to Lockwood, produces sterile catgut. The other method consists in the application of heat, and, since catgut cannot be boiled in water without being ruined, Mayo Robson has advised sterilization in xylol, which is kept at the temperature of boiling water for half an hour. A special metal cylinder with a screw top is required. The catgut is loosely wound on a reel or slide, and sufficient xylol is placed in the cylinder to cover the catgut ; the top is then screwed down, and the cylinder is placed in a saucepan of cold water, which is gradually brought up to the boil, and allowed to remain boiling for half an hour. The catgut is then removed and kept in alcohol. A similar method, using alcohol for xylol, has been recommended by Jellett. The preparation of the patient may be considered under the two heads of general and local. It has long been recognised that highly nervous patients are much more difficult not only to anaesthetize, but to treat after an operation. In the same way attempted suicides always give rise to much anxiety after an operation, and, as MacCormac has pointed out, wounded soldiers suffer more severely from shock after a defeat than they do after a victory. We must therefore admit that the nervous system has an influence on the

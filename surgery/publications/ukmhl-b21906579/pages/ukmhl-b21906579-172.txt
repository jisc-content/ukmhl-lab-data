The last-named is very useful when the patient expresses a wish for it, since the malt which it contains is of some nutritive value ; it also acts as an aperient. In France the stimulant is usually diluted with Vichy water, but this is not essential.

In every abdominal case our wish is to prevent any stasis of the intestinal contents due to the temporary paralysis of peristaltic action caused by injury, or the application of irritating antiseptics, and we must use every endeavour to re-establish the normal peristalsis as soon as possible. One reason for the early opening of the bowels is the avoidance of the condition known as pseudo-ileus, which is a form of intestinal obstruction brought about by paralysis of the gut from exposure or injury, and is often combined with the formation of adhesions in such a position as to cause a kink.

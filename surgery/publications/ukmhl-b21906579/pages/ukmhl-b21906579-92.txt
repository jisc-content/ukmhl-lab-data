Intestinal Surgery 76 I have had no personal experience of Roux’s operation, and I am inclined to think it unnecessarily severe. With regard to the best method of uniting the jejunum to the stomach, I have already stated my own preference for Halsted’s method, but 1 have also operated by double continuous sutures, and my only objection to the method is the danger of subsequent contraction of the opening. With regard to Halsted’s method, I know that the opening remains patent, as I have had opportunities of examining the opening more than two years after an operation. The other operations on the stomach to which I refer are (i) pyloroplasty, and (2) pylorectomy. 1. Pyloroplasty.—This operation was recommended by Heinke and Mickulicz for the relief of pyloric stricture, and as a substitute for gastro-enterostomy. It consists in the division of the stricture in a horizontal direction, and the suture of the resulting incision in a vertical direction. It is performed as follows : An incision is made through the entire length of strictured pylorus, and is continued into the healthy stomach and duodenum for at least \ inch on each side. It is easiest to make the incision into the stomach first, close to the pylorus, and then to pass a director through the stricture, and divide the pylorus horizontally with scissors ; the incision is then continued into the duodenum for \ inch. Two hooks are then inserted into the middle of the incision, and the opening is pulled apart so as to make a lozenge-shaped opening. A stitch uniting the whole thickness of the stomach is then placed at the angles of the original incision, and these are drawn to- gether so as to connect the horizontal into a vertical opening. This is shown in Fig. 73.

733 PERFORATING ULCER IN ITS RELATIONS TO BUNION. Treatment of Perforating Ulcer.—Of course all that will improve the general health is advisable, and one medicine vaunted by Yesigne should be tried in small doses, although probably useful only as a tonic, viz., Fowler’s solution. As a palliative, the use of an artificial limb applied to the flexed leg, has been recommended, as removing pressure and irritation. When no operation is advisable, or possible, it should be tried. When operative inter- ference seems indicated, I consider it of prime importance to ascertain if anaesthesia of the skin be present. When this is marked, the operation should at least remove the portion of the member which is anaesthetic. If the sensibility of the leg is much affected, and the patient’s general condition is not good, an amputation just below the knee would probably give the best result. When the sensibility of the heel is preserved, a Syme’s, PirogofTs, or sub-astragaloid amputation should be resorted to. This is usually found effectual in staying the further progress of the disease, as this is, almost invari- ably, strictly limited to the anterior segment of the foot. When, on the other hand, no anaesthesia is present, and the disease is limited, a mere removal of the necrosed portions of bone, attention to the general health, and appropriate dressings will usually prove effectual. By attention to these rules I think that, upon the one hand, no unnecessarily severe measures will be resorted to, and that, upon the other hand, when an operation is undertaken, it will not have to be repeated.1 1 I would here express my indebtedness to Mr. Ralph W. Seiss for much valuable aid in mak- ing notes and abstracts of cases, which have greatly aided me in the preparation of this article.

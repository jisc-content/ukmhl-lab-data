GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 208 of course, by wound complications; but, with the exceptions already referred to, the operation should be held in reserve as the complement of expectancy. As based upon a far larger number of cases, and for every reason giving a nearer approximation to the legitimate death-rate of amputations in the upper extremity than the tables compiled chiefly from the Crimean returns, Otis’s statistics are here presented.

Early, formal excisions in continuity should not be employed, since they are dangerous to life, frequently necessitate after-amputation, and, if of any extent, are very likely to be followed by disabling deformities, or by false-joints, or dangle-limbs. On account of necrosis, however, excision may often, at the proper time, be very advantageously performed, and even an entire bone may sometimes be properly removed.1 That the treatment by expectancy may result in success, loose fragments must be removed, thorough drainage secured, the limb immobilized, and septic infection prevented. How far the accomplishment of the latter object may require the adoption of a strict “antiseptic treatment,” the future must decide. Lower Extremity. Flesh Wounds of this region are of common occurrence and of exceptional gravity ; they are at times of very large size, as when the thigh or the calf of the leg has been struck by a shell-fragment, or as the result of hospital gangrene. The main vessels—femoral, popliteal, or tibial—are frequently involved in the injury, by laceration, or, more often, contusion. Both artery and vein may be simultaneously wounded, or, on the other hand, both may 1 It is interesting to notice that, in the only recorded case of complete exsection of the scapula after gunshot injury (F. II. Hamilton’s, in 1866), the operation was a late one for necrosis. Early and extensive removal of portions of the shoulder-blade has been practised in quite a number of cases, three times by one operator, Chipault, of Orleans.

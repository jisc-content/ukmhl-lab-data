GUNSHOT INJURIES OF THE SHOULDER. 155 of antiseptics, an amputation wound may be expected to heal sooner and with less suppuration than that of an excision. The difference in the fatality of the two operations is not very great; the ad- vantage on the side of exsection is, that, if successful, there remains an useful limb. Unfortunately, in no small proportion of the cases of joint removal, though life is saved, the part is of little, sometimes of no value. In about every fortieth case, Gurlt found that the limb was not only useless, but a burden; in one-ninth (75, or 11.5 per cent.) of the 652 cases the “end-results” of which he ascertained, the functional value of the part was nil; in one- half (322,or49.38 per cent.), the limb could be satisfactorily and properly used only with the aid of some prothetic apparatus; in less than one-third (202, or 30.98 percent.) was the part quite useful; and in only one in seventeen (38, or 5.83 per cent.) was the functional integrity of the limb completely regained. Occasionally, when the conditions have been exceptionally favorable, and when it has been possible to make the operation sub-periosteal and subcapsular, complete osseous regeneration has taken place, so that even in size and shape the joint has been restored. Practically, a primary sub-periosteal resection cannot be effected, and it is an useless waste of time to attempt it. Subse- quent amputation has been found necessary in about one case in every twenty (152 out of 3161), with a resulting mortality of 48 per cent. (73 out of 152). Of late-occurring deaths of individuals operated upon more or less success- fully, a very considerable number have been from pulmonary tuberculosis; but this form of disease is generally, it is probable, in no way consequent upon either the wound or its treatment. As respects the time of operation, exsections, like amputations, are divided into the primary, the intermediary, and the secondary ; of which the interme- diary are most dangerous to life, and the primary least so.1 Of the six larger joints, the shoulder and elbow are those much the most frequently exsected, the percentage being, according to Gurlt, for the shoulder 45.29, elbow 39.21, wrist 3.62, hip 3.79, knee 3.98, ankle 4.39 ; the shoulder and elbow together are thus operated upon eighty-five times in every hundred ; or, in other words, nearly one-half of the exsections for gunshot injury are of the head of the humerus, and two-fifths are of the elbow. Although perhaps more properly coming up for consideration under the general head of “ injuries of the extremities,” it is for many reasons prefer- able to notice in this connection the wounds of the several major articulations. Gunshot Injuries of the Shoulder. The frequent injuries of the shoulder-joint are almost always penetrating wounds, with fractures of one or both of the bones entering into its forma- tion. There may, however, occur also a fracture without accompanying skin laceration, as from a large shot or shell fragment; perforation of the soft parts, with contusion of the joint-structures; penetration without osseous lesion —seventy-two cases of the two last-mentioned injuries were reported during our late war; or, rarely, splintering of the humerus from an injury of its 1 According to G-urlt’s tables, of 1056 primary exsections, 317 were fatal (30 per cent.); of 286 intermediary, 131 (45.80 per cent.); and of 1622 secondary (not including “late” cases and those the time of performance of which was unknown), 610 (37.60 per cent.). That primary operations give the best results, is further shown by the fact that while of 141 German primary operations, 50 (35.46 per cent.) were fatal, and of 1126 secondary, 416 (36.94 percent.); of 915 primaries during our late war, 267 (29.18 per cent.) were fatal, and of the 496 secondaries, 194 (39.11 per cent.).

197 GUNSHOT INJURIES OF THE PELVIS. likely to be the case than when the artificial anus is due to causes other than gunshot injury, it must generally be destroyed ; and use may then often be advantageously made of some form of enterotome or compressor, such as Du- puytren’s (Fig. 291) or Gross’s (Fig. 292). Fig. 291. Fig. 292. Gross’s enterotome. Gunshot Injuries of the Pelvis. In wounds of this region, damage may be done only to the external soft parts; or there may be associated injury of the innominate bone or sacrum, with or without penetration of the pelvic cavity ; or penetration or perfora- tion may occur without any accompanying bone lesion. Not infrequently, the wound involves also the abdomen or the genitals. Lodgment of the mis- sile often takes place—in the thick external muscular mass, in the bone, some- where in the cavity, or even in the bladder or rectum. As the result of shell injury, great destruction of the overlying soft parts is produced, at times in non-fatal cases; and frequently extensive shattering of the ilium is to be noticed, even in wounds from musket balls. Lesions of the bladder may be expected to be followed by urinary extravasa- tion, intra- or extra-peritoneal according to the location of the vesical open- ing ; a bullet, or a piece of bone, may, however, ultimately work its way by Fig. 293.

Contusion of the hypogastrium may cause temporary para- lysis of the bladder, or even permanent incontinence, as in the case reported

GONORRHOEA. 382 Paraphimosis, if seen at first while the preputial swelling is oedematous and not inflammatory in its character, should be immediately reduced. The ordinary procedure, and one which usually suffices (Pig. 322), consists in oiling the parts, locking the index fingers of the two hands above and behind the corona glanclis, the Fig. 322. middle fingers below and beneath it, and gradually compressing the glans itself with the thumbs, emp- tying its congested vessels and finally forcing it backward while the fingers bring forward the swollen foreskin. Or the body of the penis may be encircled with the thumb and index finger of one hand, while with the other, the glans is gradually compressed and pushed into the preputial orifice. (Fig. 323.) It must be remem- bered that, not only the glans, but also a ring of swollen mu- cous membrane is to be returned through that orifice. Sometimes by slightly elongating the parts instead of pressing them di- rectly backward, their transverse diameter will be lessened, and their reduction will be facilitated. If the tip of the forefinger can be insinuated beneath the constricting ring, the subsequent treatment be- Reduction of paraphimosis by ordinary method. COmeS eHSy. When these means fail, or in- deed, in preference to them in many cases, the method of Mr. Eddowes (Fig. 324) has in my hands been most satisfactory. It consists in wrapping the glans Fig. 323.

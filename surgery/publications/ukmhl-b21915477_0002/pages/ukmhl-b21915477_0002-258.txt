212 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. of cotton; and by the adoption of all practicable measures, therapeutic and hygienic, to prevent the development of septic wound-complications, it is highly probable that, in the future, limbs and lives will be saved in much larger proportion than they have been in the past, and that this part of mili- tary surgery may prove much less unsatisfactory than heretofore. As the result of Robuchon’s investigations, it would appear that “ 4234 amputations of the thigh, done at Antwerp, at Paris (1830), in the Crimea, in Italy, in America, and in Germany (during the war of 1870), had a mortality of 77 per cent.” Of Beck’s 171 cases in the Baden army, during the Franco-German war, 103 died, or 60.23 per cent., the primary operations resulting fatally in 50.62 per cent. (41 out of 81), the intermediary in 84.73 per cent. (16 out of 19), and the secondary in 64.8 per cent. (46 out of 71). Of Janes’s 155 cases treated in the Letterman general hospital on the battle-field of Gettysburg, 54, or 34.84 per cent., died; 74, or 47.74 per cent., were discharged, cured; and 27, or 17.42 per cent., when last heard from, were living, but not cured. Of 1597 cases reported in‘Circular No. 6, S. G. O., 1029 died, or 64.4 per cent.; the mortality according to location, as far as yet determined and reported, was : in the upper third, 75 per cent. ; in the middle third, 54.83 per cent. ; and in the lower third, 46.09 per cent. Though the published statistics of the most important wars of the last thirty years are, unfortunately, as yet incomplete, it would seem that there had been, since the commencement of the Crimean war, a decided increase in the percentage of recoveries with preservation of limbs. Such reports as that from the field of Langensalza (38 cases with 28 recoveries, or 73.6 per cent.); as that from Stromeyer’s field-hospital at Fining (34 cases with 24 probable recoveries, or 70.6 per cent,.); and as that of Beck (131 cases of frac- ture of the femoral shaft with 87 recoveries, or 66.5 per cent-.), certainly indi- cate that in military practice, when the wounded can be duly watched and, pro- perly treated from the time of injury, and need not be transported, conservatism will give decidedly better results than amputation. With very much greater probability of a satisfactory recovery, expectancy may be resorted to in frac- tures of the thigh occurring in civil life, and its adoption should, under these circumstances, be the general rule. Formal excisions in continuity should not be employed, on account of the very great danger to life,1 and the probable uselessness of the limb if death should not occur. A dangling arm may yet be a useful one ; a dangling leg is almost always simply an incumbrance, whatever sustaining apparatus may be applied. In fractures of the leg not involving the knee- or ankle-joint—these have already been considered—expectancy yields, in general, better results than operative interference. Amputation—which is, of course, to be performed when there has been a complete crushing of the foot or leg, and which may very properly be resorted to, but is not imperatively demanded, when there is associated injury of the tibial vessels, or when both bones have been exten- sively comminuted—has been followed, in military surgery, by a very con- siderable and, at times, an excessive mortality. The death-rate of 8117 leg amputations (4413 tabulated by Robuchon, of which 1981 were fatal, and 3704 reported by Chenu from the French armies during 1870-1, of which 3050 were fatal) was 61.98 per cent.—a rate increased nearly one-half by the frightful mortality of the French operations during the war of 1870-1, 82.34 per cent., or more than 10 per cent, in excess of that among the French in the Crimea. 1 Of 47 cases tabulated by S. W. Gross, 41, or 87.23 per cent., ended fatally.

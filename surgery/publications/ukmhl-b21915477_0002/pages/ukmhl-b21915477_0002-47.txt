(1) THE INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF SURGERY. CONTUSIONS. BY hunter McGuire m.tx, EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF SURGERY IN THE MEDICAL COLLEGE OF VIRGINIA, RICHMOND. A Contusion may be defined to be a laceration of the subcutaneous tissues without solution of continuity of the skin. When the force which produces the contusion divides the skin, the injury becomes what is known as a con- tused wound. If the cuticle alone is implicated, the injury is an abrasion. But while the skin is not primarily broken in contusions, it is frequently so injured that its vitality is destroyed, and that sloughing takes place subse- quently. Causes of Contusions. Contusions are caused in a variety of ways: by blows, falls, or violent pres- sure. The force which produces a contusion may be direct, as is seen in the case of the “black eye” which follows a blow of the fist, or in that of the laceration of the muscles of a limb produced by contact with a partially spent cannon ball; or it may be indirect, as in the case of a fall upon the hand, when the arm. is extended, causing contusion of the shoulder; or in that of a fall from a height, the patient striking upon his buttocks, producing injury ot the skull, with concussion and contusion of the brain. "Wb see examples of contusion from severe pressure, in railway injuries, in those caused by ma- chinery in rapid motion, and in those which result from the passage of the wheels of a vehicle over the body. A good illustration of contusion by pres- sure is sometimes observed, after difficult parturition, in the bruised scalp of the infant, and in the swollen vagina and vulva of the mother—the injury in some cases terminating in sloughing and the formation of vesico-vaginal or recto-vaginal fistuhe.

These inoculations, be it said, were made upon the bearers of the lesions and hence were auto-inoculations, but they show one point clearly, viz., that as they lose their inflammatory character they also lose their capacity for in- oculation, and here is I believe the true explanation of the “ chancroidal virus”—it is inflammation. Irritate a non-venereal pustule; excite it to inflammatory action; and I believe its pus will be capable of inoculation, in the same way that Mr. Lee, of London, rendered the secretion of the initial lesion of syphilis (usually not auto-inoculable) inoculable upon the bearer of the lesion. Until, however, that is done, it would be mere theory to say that it is possible, nor should we be justified in deducing any conclusions there- from, but we can say this much:— I. Auto-inoculation is not peculiar to, nor pathognomonic of, the pus of the simple venereal ulcer (chancroid). II. Simple pus is, under certain circumstances, capable of auto-inoculation. III. This auto-inoculability is partially due to irritative inflammation affecting the pus, and partially to irritability of the tissues. If now the above conclusions are accepted, what becomes of the “specific virus?” Would it not be better to drop it out of our vocabulary altogether, unless indeed we are ready to admit that simple pus is endowed with a specific virus which renders it auto-inoculable?

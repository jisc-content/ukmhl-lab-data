542 SYPHILIS. slow evolution disappears, under prompt treatment, by resorption of the neo- plasm, leaving no trace of its former presence. Left alone, it may lead to serious disfigurement. As has been observed, necrosis is a not unfrequent result of gummatous affections of the bones. Suppuration, phlegmonous swellings, openings with everted edges, fistulae, loss of substance in the skin, etc., are among the visible results of syphilitic necrosis, not differing, however, in this respect from the effects of other forms of necrosis. Sometimes a sequestrum is surrounded and inlaid as it were in the hypertrophied superjacent tissues, as in a portion of eburnated bone surrounding it. Syphilitic necrosis may extend by the formation of new gummatous deposits, giving the edge of necrosed bone a peculiar “polycyclic” appearance, which is quite characteristic and most apt to be observed in the skull (Fig. 334).

An absurd superstition still prevails among the ignorant regarding the influence of mercury in causing bone troubles. It is hardly necessary to say that this is entirely without foundation. On the one hand, abundant statistics exist to show that untreated syphilis is more likely to show bone disease; and, on the other hand, it has been found that miners and workers in mercury are not any more subject to osseous affections than other persons. The following tables from Jullien show the comparative frequency of the various syphilitic bone affections and their commoner localization:— Comparative Frequency of Various Forms of Syphilitic Bone Disease.

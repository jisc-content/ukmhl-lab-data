ANTISEPTIC IRRIGATION. 51 be used, the mode of its application, and the character of the wound to which it is applicable. Every surgeon seeks to make and to keep liis patients’ wounds as clean as possible, and by means of antiseptic solutions or applica- tions to destroy, neutralize, or guard against any and every outside or local influence that can possibly bring about or encourage chemical or fermentative changes in a wound. It is true that, within the last few years, a school of surgeons has been formed, the members of which talk of “Antiseptic Surgery,” and claim for themselves the title of “Antiseptic Surgeons,” as if it were applicable to them- selves alone, or rather to such of their body as have a belief in the germ theory as a cause of most, if not all, the surgical ills to which wounded flesh is heir; who assert, rather loudly and dogmatically, that “antiseptic surgery” must stand or fall with the theory upon which their practice is based; that no unbeliever in the theory is likely to carry out the practice with any probability of success, since it is only by a staunch believer in the theory that care and attention to every detail of treatment, sufficient to bring about a good result, are likely to be given. It is true, also, that the results claimed for this practice are great, very great, beyond all previous belief; that, according to these gentlemen, opera- tions which in former times were looked upon as dangerous, can now be undertaken with “certainty” of success; and that others which have hitherto been regarded as unjustifiable, are now legitimate and safe. In fact, the up- holders of this theory and adopters of this practice maintain that exploratory and operative measures, which have been regarded as being beyond the prov- ince of the surgeon, may now be calmly and quietly undertaken with a “moral certainty” of being followed by a good result. Thus it is that our sanguine confreres talk of cutting into healthy joints with the “ certainty” that no dan- ger will follow, and declare that great operations upon the bones of the knee may be undertaken with the feeling that in so doing we do not subject the patient “to any risk whatever.” That a wedge-shaped piece of bone may lie taken from a deformed femur, with the confidence that such a produced com- pound fracture is “perfectly safe,” and “without risk;” and last, but not least, that the peritoneal cavity, under “antiseptic precautions,” may be opened “with impunity.” I need hardly say that much of this is bold assertion and nothing more, and that it is apparently due to the sanguine temperament which seems attached to those who pin their faith to a taking theory, and adopt the practice which is based upon it, in blind deference to the authority of its distinguished ori- ginator ; for facts, calmly looked at, neither by their number nor by their weight, justify these conclusions, but irresistibly suggest that an enormous superstructure has been raised by the ingenuity of its builders upon a narrow foundation, and that good results have been too hastily attributed to causes which have been but some of the factors of a work to which others equally potent for good have without doubt contributed. Facts, indeed, have been employed by our self-styled “antiseptic” friends, as legal advocates use small data which tell in their favor, to support the cause they have in hand; but not as the judge who has to weigh evidence, and with an unbiased mind give judgment. It . is only by this explanation that we can understand how the “antiseptic surgeon,” when he gets a good result,'is so fond of asserting that such could not have been brought about by any other form of practice than that which he has adopted; and, when he is attempting an operation which may in all truth be called experimental, if not rash, maintains that he under- takes it “under the spray” with all confidence, and with a moral certainty of meeting with success. We must admit, however, that surgery is now much more successful than

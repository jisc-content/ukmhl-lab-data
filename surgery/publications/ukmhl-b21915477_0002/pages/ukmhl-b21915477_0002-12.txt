VI PREFACE. and friend for nearly thirty years—has been kindly undertaken by Dr. Nancrede, of Philadelphia, who has dealt with the subject in a thorough manner which cannot but be approved by the critical reader. The last to be mentioned—the late Prof. John T. Hodgen, of St. Louis—whose recent sudden death is fresh in the memory of all Ame- rican Surgeons, had happily completed the article (on Ulcers) which he had agreed to furnish, and it will be found in its proper place. The names of all of these eminent men will long be preserved and honored in the annals of American Surgery. The illustrations which accompany this Volume will, it is hoped, commend themselves to the reader, both by their artistic excellence and by their practical value as a means of interpreting the text. Most of the plates, as well as several of the wood-cuts, are from drawings exe- cuted by the Editor’s former pupil, Dr. Taylor, while a large number of the cuts in the article on Gunshot Wounds have been liberally and courteously furnished by the Surgeon-General of the U. S. Army, and represent specimens contained in the unrivalled collection of the Army Medical Museum. JOHN ASinilTRST, Jr. Philadelphia, 2000 West Delancf.y Place, July, 1882.

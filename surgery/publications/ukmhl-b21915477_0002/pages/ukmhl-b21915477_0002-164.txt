118 SABRE AND BAYONET WOUNDS ARROW WOUNDS. do harm. A trusty and intelligent corps of nurses is indispensable, if heat is to be used in this way. After the primary danger of peritonitis is past, the patient should be kept in the horizontal posture for a month, and fed chiefly on beef, or mutton, or fowl, to which it will be prudent to add some pepsin. Olive oil will keep the bowels in a proper condition. In concluding the subject of arrow wounds, I would briefly recapitulate as follows:— (1) An arrow head must be removed as soon as found. (2) In the search for the arrow, extensive incisions are justifiable. (3) An arrow may be pushed out as well as plucked out. (4) The finger should be used for exploration in preference to a probe. (5) Great care must be taken to avoid detachment of the shaft. (6) Healing by first intention should be encouraged. (7) The surgeon should strive to comfort the patient. Although arrow wounds are not attended with much shock, they are usually the cause of great depression of spirits. “ The constitutional disturbances following these wounds . . . are liable to be out of all proportion to the apparent amount of damage. There are almost always considerable . . . sleeplessness and great irritability, dejection of spirits, and intolerance of pain. The tendency to despondency becomes frequently a prominent symptom, to be carefully combated, and everything should be done to cheer the patient.”1 1 Coues, loc. cit.

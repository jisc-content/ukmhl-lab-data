Defe- cation also is painful, markedly so if the feces are inspissated, and the finger inserted into the rectum feels the anterior wall pushed into the centre of the bowel, hot, unnaturally firm, and tender to the touch, while through it the indefinite outlines of the greatly enlarged prostate can be felt. Fig. 313. Relations of the prostate to the neck of the bladder and the rectnm. As the disease progresses the pain increases, becomes throbbing, particu- larly when the patient is erect or in the sitting posture, radiates along the cords of the hypogastric plexus to all the neighboring regions, and is very greatly aggravated by any evacuation of the bladder or rectum. The fre- quency and difficulty of micturition both increase, the latter sometimes pro- ceeding to complete retention. The disease may terminate by resolution, the most frequent way, or by suppuration. In the former event, the symptoms gradually subside, and the urethral discharge, which has been replaced during this period by the albu- minoid secretion of the prostate, reappears and is often profuse. If suppura- tion occurs, it is usually due to the coalescence of several inflamed follicles, which, lying in proximity to one another, have broken down into a common cavity. The pus is frequently discharged into the urethra, but occasionally pointing takes place in the direction of the rectum. In either event, evacua- tion gives great relief. In most cases, the prostate is left with some fibrous thickening—a hyper- plasia of its cellular tissue—which is often the groundwork for future trouble, but which should not be confounded with the hypertrophy of the same tissue

THE SIMPLE VENEREAL ULCER OR CHANCROID. 420 The Simple Venereal Ulcer is Ordinarily Multiple.—Another feature of the simple venereal ulcer is its multiplicity, due to two causes, the first and most important one being auto-inoculation, the second and least im- portant being immediate contagion. When the contagious nature of this form of ulcer is remembered, it will not be deemed surprising that multi- plicity is the rule rather than the exception, and this feature, when compared with the singleness of the initial lesion, is one of consequence. The appended tables will show not only the tendency toward multiplicity which marks the simple venereal ulcer, but also the difference which exists in this respect between it and the initial lesion of syphilis. These tables are so suggestive that a few lines devoted to their teaching will not be wasted. Multiplicity op the Simple Venereal Ulcer as Compared with the Initial Lesion of Syphilis. Table V.

Labarthe, in his thesis, “ Le Chancre simple,” speaks of having seen in 1868, in M. Fournier’s wards in Lourcine, a woman who was the hearer of the prodigious number of seventy- five chancroids. 2 In the article from which this is copied the figure is 327. As this is evidently erroneous, I have taken the liberty of changing it.

LOCALITY OF SIMPLE VENEREAL ULCER. 425 But before taking up this question of cephalic chancroid, let us see upon what portions of the body the simple chancre is most likely to occur. Upon turning to the tables bearing upon this point, we observe that out of a total number of 1271 cases in the male, 1194 occur upon the genitals, and of these, 826 are recorded as occurring upon the glans penis, upon the prepuce, upon the fossa glandis, and upon the sheath of the penis; 24 at the meatus urina- rius ; 9 within the urethra; 9 upon the scrotum ; 3 about the anus ; 3 on the finger; 5 upon the leg; 1 on the anterior thoracic region ; and 1 on the nates. In the female we have the following record: the external genitals were the seat of the simple venereal ulcer in 185 cases; the meatus urinarius and its vicinity, and the urethra, in 26 cases ; the vagina in 68 cases. The lesion was situated at the margin of the anus in 33 cases; at the inter-crural angle in 5 cases; on the perineum in 7 cases; on the inner aspect of the thighs and upon the hypogastrium in 7 cases; on the cervix uteri alone in 1 case, and on the fourchette and cervix uteri together in 58 cases. Expressed in percentage, the extra-genital chancroids are only 6.05 per cent, of the total number of chancroids recorded, while of these none are cephalic (that is, occurring upon the head and face).

SYPHILIS. 556 Hereditary Syphilis. Etiology.—Regarding the manner in which syphilis is transmitted from parent to offspring, there is as yet no agreement among syphilologists. Whether a syphilitic father can impress his disease upon the fecundating germ, so that the resulting foetus shall be syphilitic without the intervention of the impregnated female, or whether syphilis can only pass to the foetus through the mother, are questions upon which the best authorities differ widely. Numerous cases tending to prove one view or the other, and going to show on the one hand that syphilis can come only from the mother, or, on the other hand, that it may proceed from the father alone, have been reported, but the majority of these reports are lacking in convincingly precise details, and many are ludicrously wanting in care and accuracy. To some so-called “ observers” no case can be so destitute of wTell-ascertained data as to be unser- viceable in proving the preconceived theory. A careful examination of the cases thus far reported by trustworthy ob- servers, and a comparison of these with my own personal experience, incline me to the belief that, while in the majority of cases of hereditary syphilis the mother has been syphilitic, yet that a certain number of carefully observed cases, reported by some among our ablest living clinicians, go to indicate that a syphilitic father may procreate syphilitic children, the mother remaining to all appearance, and in all likelihood, perfectly healthy. The chief champion of the paternal influence in this county is Dr. R. W. Taylor, but although most of our syphilographers, as far as they have expressed themselves in print, are inclined to take this view of the subject, there are not wanting others, prominent among whom is Dr. F. R. Sturgis, who stoutly deny the possibility of syphilis being transmitted to the ovum in utero by the semen of the male parent, without the mother being infected either by the husband or by the ovum.

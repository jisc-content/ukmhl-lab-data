DEFECTS IN THE HEALING PROCESS, AND DISEASES OF GRANULATIONS. 61 way; but he will be able to recognize in the changed appearance of the granulations themselves, and of the thin blue line of cicatrization, the slight- est deviation from the healthy type; for while it is true that, as long as a granulating surface is healing kindly, the inference is correct that the subject of the “sore” is healthy; it is ecpially certain, when the granulating surface has deviated from the healthy path, that there is something wrong, either in the patient, in the part itself, or in its treatment. Thus, in a patient who is anaemic, the granulations will be pale and blood- less; and when this condition has been of long standing, they will lose their small conical form, and appear as coarse, watery elevations. When there is any interference with the return of the venous blood from the granulating part, from either heart disease, the dependent position of the limb, or the im- proper use or bad application of bandages or other mechanical appliances, the granulations will appear congested to variable degrees, and may even bleed; they may be so congested and full of venous blood as to put on the purple appearance which suggested to the old authors the name of the “juniper ulcer,” the granulations being so full of venous blood as to appear as blue or black as a juniper; the sore is then, clinically, said to be congested. When it bleeds it is generally called hemorrhagic. When from some constitutional or local cause the reparative process is acting feebly, the deficiency of action may be seen in the granulations, or rather in the sore—for under these circumstances the surface of the sore will either present a few ill-formed and feeble granulating spots, or it will appear smooth and apparently deficient in granulations altogether, and will look to the eye not unlike the tense mucous surface of the pharynx. In other cases, the reparative force may be too feeble to express itself in any granulating pro- cess, and the sore may present a greenish, dirty-colored surface, discharging an acrid or putrid substance which is clearly blood and serum mixed with the decomposing elements of dead tissue, the ill-formed granulations or gran- ulation-tissue dying superficially, as soon as formed, for want of power to live and develop. In more extreme eases of deficiency of power, what may have been a reparative process not only ceases to be so, but becomes retro- grade ; what had been a constructive, changes into a destructive force, and the tissues that should have been repaired break down and undergo molecular disintegration, the sore, instead of healing, becoming an ulcer, and the new tissue dying from want of vitality. At times, when the reparative power is feeble, and yet granulations form, these will present a corresponding appear- ance ; that is, they will have a pale, watery, oedematous character, and the discharge from them will not be normal pus, but a sero-purulent fluid ; the granulations that form are of a weak type, and the sore then constitutes a weak ulcer. On the other hand, excess of action may at times affect a granulating or healing sore, and, when it does so, it affects the granulating process as much as it has been shown to do a wound in which quick union or primary adhe- sion is sought for. In the stage of irritation, or that in which the granula- tion-tissue is simply over-stimulated, over-action shows itself in an excess of secretion from the granulating surface, in the shape of pus, and probably in some increase in the size and redness of the granulations themselves; and when this is other than a passing condition from some temporary cause, it will soon pass into one of inflammation. When inflammation attacks a granulating sore, changes will occur similar to those which have been described as taking place when it affects a healing wound. Physiologically, there will be an arrest of the healing process, an arrest of secretion from the granulations, and, if the action be lasting, a change from

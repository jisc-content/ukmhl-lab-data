GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 120 With the use of the modern arms of precision, the old-fashioned round balls, of f to 1J oz. weight each (Fig. 234), have almost entirely disappeared as vulnerating bodies, except as secondarily projected by the bursting of case- shots filled with them. The muzzle-loading smooth bore, with the single hall or “ buck and ball” cartridge, is as much a thing of the past as “ brown Bess” herself. The service bullet of to-day, long and generally conoidal (Figs. 235, 236, 237)—egg-shaped in that used with the needle-gun (Fig. 238)—has a diameter of from .41 to .45 inch, and weighs from 315 to 480 grains. The Swiss magazine-gun bullet measures .41 inch, and weighs 315 grains; the Russian .42 inch, 375 grains ; the Austrian .425 inch, 318 grains ; the French .45 inch, 380 grains; the Bavarian .45 inch, 340 grains; the Prussian .45 inch, 380 grains; the English .45 inch, 480 grains; and that of the United States .458 inch, 405 grains. In the English and American service the bullet is made of hardened lead-—13 parts lead, 1 part tin (English); 16 parts lead, 1 part tin (American)—and such bullets may perhaps do less damage than those of soft lead, though it must be remembered that in the experi- ments that have been made, the diameter of the pure lead Enfield bullet (Fig. 236), was considerably (0.1 inch) greater than that of the hardened one fired from the Martini-Henry rifle (Fig. 242). The Mitrailleuse ball (Fig. 243) weighs about If oz.; the Gatling guns use calibres .45 and .50 small arm ammunition, a “ half pound solid elongated projectile,” and a one inch Fig. 239. Fig. 240.

From field guns, the sizes of which vary considerably, shell and case-shot are fired, the use of solid shot having been of late abandoned; the eases con- taining from 41 to 245 or more balls each, of iron in the English service, of

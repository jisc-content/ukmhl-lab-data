433 ANATOMY OF THE SIMPLE VENEREAL ULCER. October 14. The more extensive ulceration was dressed with a dossil of lint soaked in the pus taken from a recent chancre of inoculation practised upon a syphilitic patient; this chancre was derived from a simple ulceration. October 16-25. The peripheric inflammation has increased; the ulceration has extended. The floor of the ulcer is gray ; its scalloped borders are undermined. Sup- puration is very abundant, and the patient complains of a decided heat and tingling in the part. No glandular enlargement. November 1. Ulcer is evidently transformed into a chancre. December 15. The wound which was inoculated and partially cicatrized was dressed with aromatic wine. No signs of adenitis and no signs of infection. December 27. The ulcer of inoculation, as well as the second cancerous ulceration, had both entirely healed. There was no sign of any constitutional infection. The dressings had been diachylon at first, and afterwards aromatic wine. So far, then, no cases have been published, or are known, which prove the direct descent of the chancroid from syphilis, as those which I have presented (the only cases I can find upon this branch of the subject) are all open to serious question. Of course, it would be idle to speculate upon the possibility of future ex- periment proving this derivation, so that we must at present content ourselves with saying that the simple venereal ulcer (chancroid) is derived from the secre- tion of another chancroid, or of a virulent (chancroidal) bubo, and from nothing else. iNor does the possibility of simple pus being auto-inoculable deprive this fact of any of its importance. Anatomy of the Simple Venereal Ulcer. But little has been written upon this subject, and most of our knowledge of the pathology of the chancroid is derived from the works of German Fig. 327. a e Section made through a soft chancre [chancroid].

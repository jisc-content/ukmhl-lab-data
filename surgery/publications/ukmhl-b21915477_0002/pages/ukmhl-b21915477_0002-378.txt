824 GANGRENE AND GANGRENOUS DISEASES. Treatment.â€”The treatment, as recommended by Dr. Leale, is to first locate the artery of the lip by pressing one finger beneath and another over the lip, when the arteria septi nasi will be felt strongly pulsating. A free incision is then made, without wounding the artery, the entire length of the induration, exposing the centre of the pustular mass. Now, with a piece of ivory or wood, about the size of a quill, with its end thoroughly wound around with cotton, fuming nitric acid is applied to all the diseased parts, and, while being applied, is pressed into all the surrounding pockets of pus, so as to break down all intervening bands of tissue; this application is to be repeated daily when necessary.

436 THE SIMPLE VENEREAL ULCER OR CHANCROID. bi-lateral. On looking at the first of the appended tables, we observe that 71 patients were the bearers of buboes, 54 having but a single bubo, while 17 had bubo on both sides; this is accounted for by the fact that the bubo is generally mono-lateral unless the ulcer is seated upon, or close to, the frsenum of the penis, when both groins are attacked, and that chancroids of the frsenum are not as often met with as chancroids of other portions of the geni- tal mucous membrane.

The first symptom noted by the patient is a feeling of pain and uneasiness in one or both groins, aggravated by motion, and upon examina- tion the surgeon readily detects a swollen and painful glaud or glands. This enlargement differs materially from the adenitis found in syphilis, in that the gland is not felt distinct and separate from the surrounding tissues, but is sunk into and matted together with the material of inflammation, infiltra- tion and cell exudation; that the outlines are indistinct; and that the swell- ing interferes with motion. At first, redness is absent, but in a short time this symptom supervenes, and invades the entire swelling. After lasting a longer or shorter time, a point of softening declares itself at the apex of the swelling, and fluctuation is apparent on palpation. Up to this point, both kinds of bubo run the same course, and there is no means of deciding to which class the swelling belongs. As soon as fluctuation is certain, the wisest course is to open the bubo, and for these reasons: it is a good, fundamental rule in surgery to evacuate pus wherever practicable; the bubo, if simple, heals more rapidly if it be opened, while if it is “virulent,” it becomes of decided importance to open it—in the first place, to prevent burrowing, and in the next, to check the destructive action which is always present in these

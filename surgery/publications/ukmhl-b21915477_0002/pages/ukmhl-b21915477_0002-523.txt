CHANCRE. 457 chronological period, but this may be modified by the constitution and age of the patient, and still more by treatment. The following Table gives approximately the date of development of the various lesions following the appearance of the chancre. It may be of service in giving a general idea of the duration of the disease in any given case, but cannot be depended upon invariably, because, as has been remarked, treatment and other circumstances may modify the evolution of syphilis to a considerable degree. It has been compiled from various sources by Martin,1 2 and is here quoted from Bumstead and Taylor :— Symptoms. Date of usual development. Date of earliest development. Date of latest development.

The chancre is the first local manifestation of syphilis. It appears at the point where the syphilitic virus has been inoculated, showing itself after an average incubation of from about twenty to thirty days. Although twenty-one days is given as the average period of incubation of the chancre, it must be remembered that in practice quite a considerable variation from this figure in both directions is encountered. Perhaps it would be safe to allow from fifteen to thirty- five days as the ordinary limit of variation. The following table* gives the result of a large number of observations by different syphilographers :— 1 De l’Accident primitif de la Syphilis constitutionelle, p. 87.

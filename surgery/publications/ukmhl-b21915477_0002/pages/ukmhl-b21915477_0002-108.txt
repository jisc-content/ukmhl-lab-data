WOUNDS. 62 . what had been a healing process to one of ulceration. The ulceration will be more or less rapid, and associated with all the local and general phenomena of inflammation, such as redness and heat of the margins of the sore and the adjoining tissues, with pain and swelling. The degree and character of the inflammation regulate these appearances ; an inflamed sore or granulating surface presents as many different aspects as there are degrees or kinds of inflammation, for inflammation must be regarded as an accidental complica- tion of the sore, and it may attack it at any stage of its progress, or in any con- dition. At times, the granulating force may be in excess, and so act as to prevent repair. The granulations sprout above and beyond the margins in which the “ cutifying” action is carried out, and appear either as elevated, luxuriant granulations in the centre of a sore or at the orifice of a sinus, or as overhanging, florid granulations at the cicatrizing border. In these cases, there is simply an excess of granulating force, and this excess exhibits itself in fungous granulations. Again, a granulating wound, when of long standing, may show on its sur- face, or in its surroundings, evidence of the existence of any constitutional or specific condition. That is to say, a chronic sore, in a patient who has a syphilitic taint, may present features by which the presence of the syphilitic poison can be recognized; and a chronic sore, in a scrofulous subject, will manifest conditions which, if not special, as in the syphilitic, will be clear enough to indicate sufficient feebleness and torpidity of action to suggest the existence of some general dyscrasia.

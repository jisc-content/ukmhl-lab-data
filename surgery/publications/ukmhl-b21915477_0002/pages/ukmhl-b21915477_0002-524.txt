The typical chancre, as seen on the genitals, begins as a faint erythematous point, which rapidly develops into a pin-head sized papule, slightly eroded on its surface, and usually looking like a mere abrasion. As a lesion it is trifling. As Fournier remarks, it is “ the smallest, the most superficial, the most benign, the most insignificant of all possible erosions.” This abrasion or erosion is roundish, oval, or sometimes linear, and covered, excepting at its border, with a grayish pellicle (Plate IX. Fig. 1). It suppurates very slightly; is, indeed, scarcely more than slightly moist on the surface. In some cases it grows no larger; in other instances it increases in size progressively until it may attain the diameter of a centimetre or more, its base meanwhile becoming firmer and larger—indurating, in fact, until it has reached maturity (Plate IX. Fig. 2). In some cases the chancre first shows itself as a large papule, but after a time the surface of the lesion becomes excoriated or slightly ulcerated, and follows the same course as the typical lesion just mentioned. The floor of the chancre is very slightly eroded, the edges sloping gradually, not clear cut and excavated as in the case of chancroid. Xow and then, however, venereal sores are met with where considerable inflammation and suppuration have occurred, and where the edges of the sore are more or less excavated. In these cases it is impossible to distinguish the nature of the lesion at first, and the diagnosis for the time must be held in suspense. If the sore is a chancre, the characteristic induration of its base supervenes. Induration op Chancre.—This induration is an important element in the characteristic picture of chancre. It usually shows itself in the first week of the sore. Sometimes, however, it is delayed for two or three weeks. It is

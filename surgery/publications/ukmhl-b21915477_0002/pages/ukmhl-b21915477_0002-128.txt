THE ANTISEPTIC METHOD OF TREATING WOUNDS. 82 second time. Sores treated in this way heal very rapidly if proper attention be also paid to position and rest; they heal more rapidly than by any other method of treatment. Various modifications of the Listerian method have been proposed, but they have seldom been satisfactory, as they have generally failed to fulfil the requirements of the aseptic principle. In the foregoing description, various modifications have been hinted at which may be followed out where better means arc not at hand, and which will be efficient as long as they are used in strict accordance with the Listerian law. Other antiseptics have been sug- gested instead of carbolic acid, but none of them have as yet been generally adopted. Perhaps the best substitute is eucalyptus oil. This has of late been used extensively by Mr. Lister in the form of eucalyptus gauze, and it acts very well. It is of great value in those rare cases in which patients suffer from carbolic poisoning. Eucalyptus gauze may be used in these instances without interfering with the aseptic principle. I would be passing the space at my disposal were I to enter into the discussion of the various materials and modifications which have been proposed. The foregoing description indicates sufficiently the best mode as yet known of applying the principle, and it will be evident that other antiseptics and antiseptic materials may be employed, and that the use of the spray may be avoided, where necessary, without in any way interfering with Listerism, which is a principle which must in the future always form the basis of any method of wound treat- ment. When properly applied, it reduces all wounds to the level of subcu- taneous injuries.

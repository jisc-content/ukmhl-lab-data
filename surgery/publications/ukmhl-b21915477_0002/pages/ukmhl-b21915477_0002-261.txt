GUNSHOT INJURIES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 215 of the Esmarch bandage. Free drainage must be secured, and suppurative teno-synovitis—which is quite likely to occur, as it is also when amputation has been performed—must if possible be prevented. The foot should be immobilized in a proper position, and much attention should be directed to the prevention of cicatricial deformities. If tetanus should be developed, and it is relatively frequent in these cases, early neurectomy might prove of great benefit. Carious bone should he gouged out, or the affected bone or bones removed. Even the entire os calcis has in a number of cases been taken away, and recovery with a useful foot followed ; and judging from the results of extensive, and even complete, excisions of the tarsus for caries consequent upon other causes, similar operations might very properly be substituted for amputation in cases of bone disease following gunshot injury.

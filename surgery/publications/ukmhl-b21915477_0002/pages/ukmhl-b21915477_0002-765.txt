NOTE ON THE PATHOLOGY OF LEPROSY. 671 Heisser draws the following conclusions from his investigations : Leprosy is a true bacterial disease, caused by a special bacterium. The bacilli appear in the tissues as such, or more probably as spores, and remain for a longer or shorter time, according to circumstances, in a state of incubation in depots, perhaps in the lymph glands. This period of incubation, much longer than in other infectious diseases, is in proportion to the physiological resistance of the human organism compared with the feeble developing power of the bacilli. It, as well as the course of the disease, is shorter in tropical countries than in Europe. From these depots, the disease extends throughout the body; in those portions of the skin most exposed, the face, hands, elbows, and knees; and in the peripheral nerves (anaesthetic form). The other organs are less freely invaded. The bacilli excite inflammation, and by a specific action transform the migrating cell into a leprous cell. Leprosy is probably an infectious disease, and its specific products are contagious, viz., the leprous cells of the tubercles, the tissue fluids, and pus containing bacilli and spores. On the other hand, all pus may not be infectious, as the fluid contained in leprous bullae is not. Leprosy is not hereditary.

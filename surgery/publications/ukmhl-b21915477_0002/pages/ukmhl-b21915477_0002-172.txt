126 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. similar position to that held at the time of the injury, and by seeing that the various openings are then all in line ; and even this study of position will not always answer, for there may have been deflection of the ball at some point of its course. That bullets, particularly round ones, are occasionally split, either in passing into or through the body, every one knows, and such division may be complete or partial. In a case under my care, a round musket ball that struck and fractured the frontal bone was so far split as that one part passed into the opening in the bone, while the other rested on the external surface, a narrow bridge uniting the halves. (Figs. 245, 246. ) Conical rifle bullets are much less likely to be thus affected, but abundant evidence has accumulated to prove the incorrectness of Macleod’s belief that “ with their immense force of propulsion the}7 cannot be split.” (See Figs. 247, 248.) Pistol balls, elongated though they are, are every now and then divided. Fig. 247. Section of right parietal bone on which a conoidal mnsket hall has split. (A. M. M., Sect. 1, Spec. 2121.) Interior view of parietal bone represented in Fig. 247. Quite recently I saw, post mortem, that one of these missiles, after boring through the head and neck of the humerus, had, in striking the edge of the glenoid cavity, Fig. 249. Fig. 250.

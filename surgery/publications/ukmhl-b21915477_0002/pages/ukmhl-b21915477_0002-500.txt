Kaposi1 and Caspary2 are the most recent writers upon this sub- ject, and as Kaposiâ€™s description is the best, I shall give it in full Microscopical examination of a perpendicular section, including the margin, the inflamed parts in the neighborhood, together with a portion of the floor and the inflamed base of the ulcer, shows that a portion of the skin occupied by the chancroid consists of two parts, which have evidently undergone different anatomical changes. (Fig. 327.) From the floor of the ulcer, c d, to a considerable depth in the corium is a uniform and uncommonly thick cell infiltration which terminates sharply at the line f g. This infiltration is continued beneath the intact papillae of the margin of the ulcer, e l, and laterally far beyond the limits of its floor. The tissue bordering on the infiltrated Fig. 328.

In the swollen margin, a b, a number of papillae, e, lying nearest to the floor of the ulcer are thickened and closely infiltrated with cells. The layer of Malpighian cells between these papillae is thickened. These, b, overhang (undermining) the walls of the ulcer. The floor of the ulcer, c d, is formed by the exposed cell-infiltrated corium and is destitute of papillae. Both the corium and 1 Syphilis der Haut und der angrenzenden Schleimhaute. Wien, 1873.

326 GONORRHOEA. Nature of Gonorrhoea. As this subject is not only of theoretical interest but of great practical importance, the views held influencing both prognosis and treatment, and sometimes important medico-legal opinions, etc., it will be useful to look care- fully at both sides of it. Those diseases which are called “ specific,” and which are recognized as distinct clinical or pathological entities, or as depending upon definite and in- variable sources of origin, have, as a class, certain peculiarities which more or less accurately characterize them; they have a period of incubation inter- vening between the time of exposure to infection and the outbreak of the first symptoms ; they cannot be caused by traumatic influences or by anything except the essential virus of the disease, which through some channel must find its way into the general circulation ; they usually protect from a second attack; they are, in the majority of cases, accompanied by distinctive patho- logical changes or processes, which distinguish them from diseases the result of mere irritative action ; they run a definite course, and, after their termina- tion or subsidence, cannot be reawakened at will by any known agency. In gonorrhoea, not one of these conditions obtains. There is no definite period of incubation—indeed, none at all, except that which always inter- venes between the contact of an irritating foreign substance and the produc- tion of a sufficient degree of inflammation to excite subjective symptoms. A large number of widely dissimilar causes are capable of developing the disease in its greatest intensity; authentic cases are recorded of well-marked urethritis following accidental or experimental exposure to leucorrhceal dis- charges ; to the pus from a healthy abscess, or from a purulent bronchial catarrh; to the secretion from an endo-cervicitis or endo-metritis; to the dis- charge resulting from ulceration or malignant disease of the uterus ; to the menstrual fluid or acrid vaginal discharges; to powerful injections; to the passage of gravel; to catheterism ; and to many other undoubtedly non-spe- cific causes. The condition thus evoked is in no wise distinguishable from that following sexual intercourse with a person already having a similar dis- ease, some of the most severe and most complicated cases of gonorrhoea which have fallen under the notice of the writer having been derived from one or the other of these sources. The assertion that in so-called “ true” gonorrhoea the disease has a peculiar tendency to become chronic or to run into obstinate gleet, while on the other hand “ simple” gonorrhoea, or urethritis, tends to subside spontaneously, cannot be admitted as an argument based upon clinical facts. It may be positively stated that no sound inference as to the cause, in any particular case, can be drawn from its course or symptoms, and that the variations observed in the different grades of urethritis are no greater than those which prevail among inflammations of other mucous passages, and which are due to individual idiosyncrasy, or to differences in the power of the original irritant. So far from exercising any protective influence against subsequent attacks, gonorrhoea, like tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, enteritis, cystitis, etc., pre- disposes to them, often, especially if it has been protracted, leaving the ure- thra in an atonic, relaxed, or catarrhal condition, or else roughened, granular, and congested. It is exceedingly common to have patients remark that, although frequently exposed to contagion, they went many years without contracting the disease, but that since the first attack they acquire it every few months, which circumstance they usually attribute to “ bad luck,” or, not infrequently, to an imaginary necessity for conforming to a general average. In observing the course of gonorrhoea from a pathological standpoint,

GONORRHOEA IN ANOMALOUS SITUATIONS. 405 chiefly in dirty and degraded prostitutes who are careless of personal clean- liness, and who permit the vaginal discharges to flow over the perineal and inter-gluteal regions. It is accompanied by the usual signs of dermatitis: heat, redness, itching, vesiculation or pustulationâ€”sometimes by actual ulce- ration, which is most apt to occur in the folds of the anus and to follow them upward, assuming a linear form, and becoming true fissures. It is often associated with the formation of external hemorrhoids, and sometimes with the development of warts, but has never appeared to me to have any peculiar characters whatever, and has never, in the cases which I have seen, extended up into the rectum. Cleanliness and zinc ointment, or some desiccant powder, are usually speedily curative.

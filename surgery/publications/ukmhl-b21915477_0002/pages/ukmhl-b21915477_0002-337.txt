AMPUTATION FOR ULCERS. 291 by an attack of erysipelas, and other graftings were required before the cure was com- pleted.] Amputation for Ulcers.â€”Since the practice of skin-grafting has been generally adopted,- amputation for superficial ulcers of the limbs has been rarely performed by intelligent surgeons. And to-day, no competent surgeon would think of amputating a limb for a superficial ulcer, even though it entirely surrounded it. If, however, the muscles and deeper tissues have been destroyed to such an extent as to render the limb useless, amputation may he performed with propriety, and may even be demanded, in cases in which an artificial substitute will render better service than the diseased member.

In support of this statement, I would refer the reader to Tables XXXIV. and XXXV., p. 440. The collated cases of the simple venereal ulcer amount to 950, of which number 685 were multiple, and 265 were single, or, to express it in percent- ages, the simple venereal ulcer is multiple in a little more than 72 per cent, of the total number of cases. Even this is probably under the number, 1 Under this heading one patient had twenty-five chancroidal ulcers.

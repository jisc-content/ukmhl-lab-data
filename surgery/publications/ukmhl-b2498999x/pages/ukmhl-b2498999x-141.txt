135 be cut off with pliers); further depress the bone so as to project the condyle anteriorly, and divide the front part of the capsule. It is well to divide the inferior dental nerve at its entrance into the inferior dental canal; further parts of the capsule and some fibres of the external pterygoid may perhaps also be divided with advantage. But it must not be forgotten that more bleeding will follow cutting than tearing ; on no account should the knife be carried near the internal maxillary artery. The soft parts being divided as far as may be found convenient or safe, the remaining connections should be torn by wrenching out the bone.* Parts Divided.—In median incision : Orbicularis oris, with the inferior labial and inferior coronarj-arteries between it and the mucous membrane. On the outer surface of the jaw: Levator menti, depressores labii in- ferioris and aiiyuli oris, buccinator, masseter; facial artery and vein, mental vessels and nerve, small branches of the submental artery, facial branches of the great auricular nerve. On the inner sitrface of the jaw: The genio - hyoid anti genio-hyo-glossus and the anterior belly of the digastric (these muscles being' saved if the section of the bone is made half an inch e.xternal to the middle line); the mylo-hyoid, the superior constrictor of the pharynx with the pteryg-o-maxillary ligament, the internal pterygoid muscle, the stylo-maxillary ligament. Parts either torn or divided at the finish: Capsule, with the internal and external lateral ligaments, external pterygoid muscle, & deeper part of the masseter.

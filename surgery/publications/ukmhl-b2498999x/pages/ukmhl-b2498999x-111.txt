105 OPERATIONS ON THE ABDOMEN. Ligature of the Arteries of the Brim of the Pelvis (Common, External and Internal Iliacs, and AbdomiNj\x Aorta).—The essential point about the incision for tying either of these arteries is that, in its lower part, it should run parallel to, and lie a little above, the outa- half of Poupart’s liga- ment, not in any case extending further inivards thati the middle of the ligament, so that the deep epigastric artery he not interfered ivith. Externally, for the sake of obtaining the necessary access, the incision may be prolonged to any requisite extent, either in the direction of the umbilicus (Murray, South, Abernethy), or towards the last rib (Sir P. Crampton). The external and internal oblique and the transversal is muscles being divided, the fascia transversalis is exposed and carefully divided on the director. The peritoneum is now pushed away from off the iliacus and psoas. The common and external iliac arteries are easily found in the loose cellular tissue along the inner border of the psoas,—the corresponding veins being inter7ial to the arteries, except the right common iliac, which is jjosterior below and external above. The aneurism needle must be passed from the vein.

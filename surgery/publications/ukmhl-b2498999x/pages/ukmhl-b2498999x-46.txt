40 Syme’s and Pirigoff’s amputations. The external saphenous vein and nerve lie behind it. The base of the fifth metatajsal bone lies about two inches in front of external malleolus. Midway between the two bony processes is the line of Chopart’s medio-tarsal amputation, the exact posi- tion of which is marked by the projection of the os calcis, termed the tubercle of Chopaii. Internal Malleolus.—13roader and situated further foi'ward than, l)ut not so low as, the external. The line of the ankle-joint lies about half an inch above its lower extremity. The internal saphenous vein and nerve lie in front of it. The posterior tibial artery can be felt beating about half an inch behind it and to its outer side. About an inch in front of it is the tube7-cle of the scaphoid; and a little below and behind the two bony processes is the lesser process of the os calcis, or sus- tentaculum tali. Structures behind the MsiHeoli—Sehind the intertial malleohis there comes first the tendon of the tibialis posticus nearest the surface, then the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, then in suc- cession the posterior tibial artery with a vein on either side, the posterior tibial nerve, and, finally, the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis.

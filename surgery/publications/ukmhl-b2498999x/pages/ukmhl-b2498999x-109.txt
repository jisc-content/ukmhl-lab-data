103 to the bone, and retracted. The bone is then cleared for a sufficient distance, and sawn through. Excision of the Shoulder.—Straight incision down to the bone, beginning just below the acromio- clavicular articulation. Open up the bicipital groove, and turn out the tendon of the long head of the biceps. Divide the capsule with the muscles inserted into it,* an assistant rotating the limb alternately inwards and outwards, so that the several parts of the capsule may come in succession under the knife. Project the head of the humerus, and saw it off. The glenoid cavity may require scraping. Amputation at the Shoulder-Joint.— Spence’s Modification of the Oval Method. —Vertical incision down to the bone, beginning below the acromio-clavicular articulation (the same incision as that already made for the excision, so that the operation begun as an excision may be trans- formed into an amputation). Then make an oblique incision straight down to the bone from the lower * In all excisions the periosteum should be left as far as possible. This is relatively easy when it is swollen and loosened by inflammation ; thus in the excision of the shoulder tor disease the surgeon should he able, with a proper ra-spatory, to separate the periosteum and the muscles inserte into the tuberosities from the subjacent bone, instead of dividing he capsule as above indicated. In all excisions, also, no more bone should he sawn off than can be helped; some diseased cancellous tissue may be gouged away, if necessary.

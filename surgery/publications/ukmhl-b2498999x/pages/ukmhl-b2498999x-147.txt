141 thyroid gland may be drawn up, or, if it is much in the way, it may be divided in the middle line without much danger of hfemorrhage. Trachea first fixed, and then divided from below upwards, as above explained, to the extent of three rings or more. The inferior thyroid veins are usually a little to each side of the median line, and may be displaced during: the operation ; but cross branches must necessarily be divided. A mcdification of the operation, specially applicable when the isthmus of the thyroid gland is divided, consists in making a ti’ansverse cut along the lower border of the cricoid cartilage so as to dir ide the fascia covering the trachea, which, with the veins, may then be pushed down out of the way. The thyroidea ima eiiicry occasionally passes up in front of the trachea to the isthmus of the thyroid gland. The left innominate vein crosses the trachea below the top of the sternum in the adult, hut in the child it usually rises higher. In infants the thymus gland usually rises a little above the sternum in the nriddle line, and higher still laterallr-, sometimes touching the thyroid glaml; occasionally it remains largely der-eloped up to or near puberty. The carotid arteries are on each side of the canal, which, it will be remembered, is much deeper below than above. (Esophagotomy,—The msophagu.s deviafe.s io the left towards the lower part of the neck. It can here be reached by an incision along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, between the superior thyroid artery on the one hand, and the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve on the other. It should be opened longitudinally. If the canal be not distended by a foreign body, which the operation is intended to remove, it will be necessary that its walls be projected by the introduction of a catheter or some such instrument. A few stitches may be applied to the oesophagus, although they are really not necessary. 10

18 musculo-cutaneous or external cutaneous nerve. The musctilo-spiral nerve is deeply situated behind the musculo-cutaneous, between the brachialis anticus and the supinator longus. At the apex of the triangle is the termination of the tnedia7i vei?i. The circulation in the brachial artery may be completely arrested by forcible flexion of the fore- arm upon the arm. Skeleton of the Elbow.— Internal condyle more prominent than the external, and situated a little higher; external condyle less prominent than the internal, and situated a little lower. Olecranon lies nearer to the inner than to the outer condyle. Between it and the inner condyle is a groove (“ funny bone ”) containing the ulnar nerve and the posterior ulnar recurrent artery. In extension the top of the olecranon is in the hori- zontal line of the condyles ; in the intermediate posi- tion it lies below and behind them; in complete flexion, below and in front. There is a bursa over it (miner’s bursa). The head of the radius lies just beloAv the external condyle, beneath a little pit or dimple of the skin. It can easily be felt when the forearm is rotated. A Lymphatic Gland lies just above and in front of the internal condyle.

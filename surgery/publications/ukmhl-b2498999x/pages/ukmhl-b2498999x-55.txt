49 FACE. Branches of the Fifth Nerve and Corre- sponding Vessels.—The supra-orhital nerve and artery emerge from the orbit through the supra-orhital notch or foramen at junction of inner and middle thirds of supra-orhital arch. The infra-orbital and mental foramina, with the corresponding vessels and nerves, are in a line drawn from this point to th(> interval between the bicuspid teeth of the lower jav. The auriculo-temporal ncroe emerges from under cover of the parotid gland behind the temporal artery, and accompanies the two branches of the latter. Condyle of the Lower Jaw.—Can be felt, when the mouth is opened and shut, to glide forwards and backwards upon the emiuentia articularis, in front of the external auditory meatus. Ramus of the Jaw.—Incisions made over this should be horizontal in direction, so that they may avoid both Steno’s duct and the facial nerve. Steno's duct runs along a line from the lower part of the concha to a point midway between the free margin of the lip and the ala of the nose. The trunk of the facial nerve passes downwards and forwards from the

OPERATIONS ON THE HEAD AND NECK. Ligature of the Common Carotid Artery. —Incision along the anterior border o£ the sterno- mastoid, i.e., along a line drawn from the sterno- clavicular articulation to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. For the liga- ture above the omo-hyoid muscle (the most convenient situation for tying the artery) the middle of the incision should correspond to the cricoid cartilage. Divide skin, superficial fascia, platysma, deep fascia; draw back the sterno-mastoid, and define the omo- hyoid. The artery will be found just above the latter muscle. The internal jugular vein lies on its outer side; the pneumo-gastric nerve lies between and behind the two vessels; the cord of the sympathetic lies behind the sheath of the artery ; the descendens noni nerve crosses the sheath anteriorly. If the sheath be opened with care none of the above struc- tures are endangered. The aneurism needle should be passed from the outer side. By separating or dividing the infra-hyoid muscles the artery may be tied below the omo-hyoid, in which case the skin

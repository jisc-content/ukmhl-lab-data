45 THE HEAD. Th© Scalp*—firmly connected to the tendon of the occipito-frontalis, and moves with it. A scalp wound will generally divide the tendon. Tendon of the Occipito-Frontalis.—is but loosely connected to the pericranium. Between the two is a stratum of loose cellular tissue, which easily becomes the seat of diffuse inflammatory infiltration and sloughing. Arteries of the Scal^.—Crania/, emerging from the superior internal angle of the orbit. Supra-' orbital, emerging from supra-orbital notch or foramen at junction of inner and middle thirds of supra-orbital arch. Ternporal, running between condyle of lower jaw and external auditory meatus, and then cross- ing the posterior root of the zygoma; divides into anterior and posterior branches. Posterior auricular, over front part of mastoid process. Occipital, about midway between mastoid process and external occipital protuberance. All these arteries are subcutaneous.* External Occipital Protuberance.—Always perceptible to the finger. Corresponds to the torcular ♦ One is well repaid tor a pei*usal of Mr. Treves's excellent chapter_on the Scalp. See Treves’s “ Applied Anatomy.” 4

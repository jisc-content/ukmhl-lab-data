95 and outwards, which should be a rather long one, so as to enable the operator to easily avoid the median basilic vein, should he come upon it. Divide the bicipital or semi-lunar fascia on the director. The artery will be found between the tendon of the biceps, which is on its outer side, and the median nerve, which is on its inner side. The aneurism needle should be passed from the inner side. Collateral Ciroclation.—The superior profunda anastomoses on the outer side of the elbow with the radial recurrent and the interosseous recurrent, and gives off an articular branch which joins with the anasto- motica magna. The inferior profunda anastomoses on the inner side of the elbow with both the anterior ulnar recurrent, and with the posterior. The anastomotica 7uagna anastomoses with the above, and fonns a more or less direct communication between the two profundaj through the articular branch above named. Ligature of the Ulnar Artery.—The ulnar artery is accessible in its lower two-thirds only. In this part of its course it runs along a line drawn from the inner condyle of the humerus (or from a point a little external to it) to a point a little external to the pisiform bone, along which line the incision for tying it should be made. It lies between tlie flexor carpi ulnaris and the innermost tendons of the flexor sub- limis digitorum, and has the ulnar nerve to its inner side. The aneurism needle should be passed from the inner side. Collateral Circdlation.—Anastomosing with the siiperficial palmar arch is either the superficialis vola, or the radialis indicis, or sometimes the princeps pollicis—branches, all three, of the radial. In the palm of tlic hand the deep palmar arch inosculates with the deep or communi-

34 internal saphenous vein; receive lymphatics of lower limb, and some of those of scrotum. Saphenous Opening.—Situated an inch and a halfh^Xovc and external to spine of pubes, below junc- tion of inner and middle thirds of Poupart’s ligament. Is covered in by the cribriform fascia. Its outer boun- dary is prominent and well defined, and formed by the iliac portion of the fascia lata; its inner boundary is depressed and less clearly defined, and formed by the pubic portion. Femoral Ring.—May be defined by feeling for the pulsation of the femoral artery on the pubes, and allowing half an inch on the inner side of the artery for the femoral vein; the ring is just internal to the vein. It lies about half an inch higher than the saphenous opening, immediately under the inner part of Poupart's ligament. It is bounded internally by the sharp, cutting edge of Gimbernat’s ligament; behind by the pubes, covered by the pectineus muscle; externally by the femoral vein ; and above by Poupart’s ligament, with the deep crural arch, and in the male the spermatic cord. On its inner side there may be an abnormal obturator artery ; this occurs when the obturator artery presents the double abnormality of arising from the epigastric, and of arising from the epigastric at some distance

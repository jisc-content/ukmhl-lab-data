134 aponeurosis of the tensor polati, with, probably, portions of the palato- iflossus, palato-pharjTigcus, and levator palati. Parts broken, tom, or divided at the finish; Usually the lower part of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid, with the contiguous part of the palate bone; frequently portions of the lachrjunal bone and of the os planum of the ethmoid; portions of the internal and external pterygoid muscles; the lachi-ymal sac; the infra-orbital vessels and nerve at their entrance into the infra- orbital canal. Excision of One Half of the Lower Jaw. —Central incisor extracted. Incision through middle line of lower lip, along lower border of body of jaw, and along lower half of posterior border of ramus,—not cutting higher than lobule of ear, lest the facial nerve be divided. The facial ar- tery, divided in the horizontal incision, must be tied. Dissect up the tissues of the cheek and the masseter from off the outer surface of the jaw, opening uj) the cavity of the mouth. Saw the bone near the sym- physis. (If not contra-indicated by the circumstances requii’ing the operation, it would be better to saw the bone half an inch from the symphysis, so as to leave the attachments of the genial muscles and the digastric, in which case one would extract the latc7-al incisor.) Separate the tissues of the floor of the mouth and the internal pterygoid muscle from the inner surface of the jaw, keeping the knife close to the bone so as not to endanger the lingual or gusta- tory nerve. Eorcibly draw down the bone so as to project the coronoid process, and divide the temporal muscle (or, if the coronoid process be long, it may

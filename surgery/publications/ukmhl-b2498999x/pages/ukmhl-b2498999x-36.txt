30 cartilage with the sternum. The pylorus, though extremely movable, may be said to lie near the junction of the eighth right costal cartilage with its rib. Pancreas.—hies behind the transverse colon, op- posite the second lumbar vertebra, about two or three inches above the umbilicus. Large Intestine.—The transverse colon lies in front of the pancreas, two or three inches above the umbilicus. The coecum occupies the right iliac fossa, the sigmoid flexwe the left. The ascending and the descending colon lie in right and left lumbar regions, in front of corresponding kidney. They may be reached by an incision made downwards and outwards between the last rib and the crest of the ilium, and beginning at the outer border of the erector spinm, the centre of which should correspond to a point midway between the anterior superior and posterior superior iliac spines. Kidney.—Lies opposite the two lower dorsal and two upper lumbar spines, in front of the two last ribs and projecting below them, the right one descending lower than the left. The kidney may be reached by the same incision as the colon, or a T-shaped incision may be required. Some surgeons

57 <1 small artery—the thyroidea ima. In children, the thymus gland may rise a little above the sternunn Sterno-Mastoid Muscle. -Stands out in bold relief when the face is turned towards the opposite side. When undissected, it curves forwards as far as the angle of the jaw, and covers nearly the whole of the common, external, and internal carotid artei’ies. It is crossed by the external jugular Amin, which passes down from the angle of the jaw to near the middle of the clavicle. The antei’ior jugular vein lies in front of its anterior border. Common Carotid Artery.—Extends from behind the sterno-clavicular articulation to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, running along a line draAATi from the articulation to a point midAvay between the angle of the jaAv to the mastoid process. It is deep at its origin, and relati\mly superficial at its termina- tion. The internal jugular A'cin lies on its outer side; the pneumo-gastric nerve lies bet\Amen and behind the two vessels; the cord of the sympathetic lies behind the sheath of the artery; the descendens noni ner\-e crosses the sheath anteriorly. The artery can best be compressed against the prominent anterior tubercle of the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, called the carotid tubercle, or tubercle of Chassaignac. The artery is crossed at about the level of the cricoid

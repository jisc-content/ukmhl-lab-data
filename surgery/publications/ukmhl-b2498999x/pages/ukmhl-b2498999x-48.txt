42 and has the posterior tibial nerve on its outer side. It can be felt half an inch behind and external to the internal malleolus. On Inner Side of Foot.—Is the prominent projection of the tubercle of the scaphoid, which, as regards the skin incisions, is the guide to Chopart's, or the medio-tarsal, amputation. It lies an inch in front of the internal malleolus, and between and a little behind the two bony processes is the lesser process of the os calcis, or sustentaculum tali. An inch and a half in h'ont of the tubercle of the scaphoid is the line of Lisfranc’s, or the tarso-metatarsal, amputation. On Outer Side of Foot. Is the prominent pro- jection of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, which lies about two inches in front of the external malleolus, and is the best guide to Lisfranc’s amputa- tion. Midway between it and the external malleolus is the line of the medio-tarsal, or Chopart’s, amputa- tion, the precise position of which is indicated by the projection of the os calcis, termed the tubercle of Chopart* * N.B.—In Lisfrano’s amputation, one and the same guide, the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, serves both for the skin incisions and for the disarticulation. In Chopart’s amputation, there is one guide for the skin incisions, the tubercle of scaphoid, and another for the dis- articulation, the tubercle of the os calcis or tubercle of Chopart. As these latter tubercles are opposite each other, it may be wondered why the description of the operationis complicated by two guides being given instead of one. Tlie reason is that, while the tubercle of Chopart stands

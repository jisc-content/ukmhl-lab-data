37 lowei' part of same foramen at junction of middle and lower thirds of a line drawn from posterior superior spine of ilium to outer part of tuberosity of ischium. Fold of Buttock .—Corresponds pretty nearly to lower border of gluteus maximus; is lowered in do\raward dislocations of the hip, and somewhat effaced in hip-joint disease. G-reat Sciatic Nerve. —Can easily be exposed by an incision downwards from above fold midway between great trochanter and tuberosity of ischium ; it lies on the outer side of, and then just beneath, the biceps. Patella. — Its inner border, which is more prominent than the outer, lies in a line with the big toe. The apex of the patella, the ligamentiim patcllcE, the tubc7-ele of the tibia, and the middle of the ankle-joint are also in a line one with another. In extension, the patella lies almost entirely above the femoral condyles. In flexion, it corresponds to the intercondyloid notch, and rests mainly on the outer condyle. Bursa Patellae.—Lies partly over lower part of the patella, and partly over the upper pa7d of the

140 Tracheotomy above the Isthmus.—Median incision downwards from the upper border of the cricoid cartilage for an inch and a half or more. Dissection in the median line between the infra-hyoid muscles until the trachea is reached, the veins met with being pushed aside. Draw down the isthmus; fix the trachea by a sharp hook or tenaculum inserted below the cricoid cartilage; plunge the knife (held with the hack downwards) into the trachea at the lowest part exposed, and cut upwards ; compress the bivalve tracheotomy tube between forefinger and thumb, and slip it into the opening; inti’oduce the inner tube and secure the whole with tapes round the neck. When the space between the isthmus and the cricoid cartilage is very small, as is the case in infants, it may be necessary to extend the incision through the cricoid cartilage, thus converting the operation into laryngo-tracheotofny. There are generally no vessels of any importance upon the part of the trachea here operated upon, though there may be a loop between the two superior thyroid veins, which, however, may be divided without any great risk. Arterial hEemorrhage being arrested, it is unnecessary to wait for the cessation of venous hsemorrhage, it will cease as soon as respiration is re-established. Tracheotomy below the Isthmus.— Median incision, begun over the isthmus and carried down to near the sternum. Dissection between the infra-hyoid muscles, continued mainly with the finger nail and handle of the scalpel. The isthmus of the

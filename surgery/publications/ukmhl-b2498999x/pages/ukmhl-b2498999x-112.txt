106 The internal iliac could be easily traced downwards from the bifurcation of the common trunk; its vein is internal and posterior to it. The abdominal aorta has been tied eight times, but never successfully. Collateral Circdlation.—In the case of either of the two first-named arteries, there is the anastomosis of the superior epigastric branch of the internal mammary with the deep and superficial epigastric branches of the external iliac and femoral. In the case of the common iliac, there are the anastomoses of the last lumbar artery with the ilio-lumbar and circumflex iliac; of the vesical and hajmorrhoidal arteries,—and, in the female, of the uterine and vaginal,—of one side with those of the other, —these anastomoses of the visceral arteries bringing the blood into the internal iliac artery on the side of the ligature, from whence it would get into the e.xternal iliac and femoral. In the case of the external iliac, there are, further, the anastomoses of the gluteal and circumflex iliac with the ascending branch of the external circumflex; of the obturator and sciatic with both circumflex; of the comes nervi ischiadici with the terminal and perforating branches of the profunda. Lumbar Colotomy. — Usually performed on left side. Hard pillow under right side of abdomen. Incision downwards and outwards, midway between the last rib and the crest of the ilium, beginning at the outer border of the erector spinas, the centre of which should correspond to a point midway between the anterior and posterior iliac spines. The incision divides skin and superficial fascia, portions of the external oblique and latissimus dorsi, of the internal oblique and transversalis, the outer part of the quadratus lum- borum, a portion of the lumbar fascia, and the fascia transversalis. The lower end of the kidney is easily felt below the last rib ; this is the guide to the colon, which passes down in front of the kidney. The

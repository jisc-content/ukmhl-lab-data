126 Amputation at the Hip-Joint. — Oval Method (Furneaux Jordan’s). —A circular amputation is performed at the upper third of the thigh in the ordinary way, vessels being tied and bone sawn through. Then an incision down to the bone is begun a little above the great trochanter, and carried down the outer side of the limb to meet the circular incision. The flaps being raised at their angles, the bone is rapidly freed all round up to the hip-joint, and then disarticulated, bleeding vessels being secured as fast as they are divided. The operation may be slightly modified (Lister and other surgeons) by the vertical incision being made first, in which case the angles of the flaps would be rounded off. Parts Divided.—The reader need scarcely be helped with reference to the parts cut through in the circular amputation. The vertical incision di\dde3 merely the fascia lata and, with the vastus externus, a portion of the gluteus inaximus, and branches of the external circumflex artery. In freeing the bone there is nothing of mportance" divided, save the muscles which are attached to the same, and some of the muscular branches.

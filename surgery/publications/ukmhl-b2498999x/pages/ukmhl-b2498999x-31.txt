25 ABDOMEN. Linea Alba.—is the thinnest, least vascular, and non-muscular part of the abdominal wall. It is here that we make the incision for laparotomy. Behind it lie from above downwards the left lobe of the liver, the stomach, the transverse colon, the small intestine, and the bladder when distended, the anterior surface of tlie latter being then un- covered by peritoneum. Linese Transversse. — Generally three, the lowest being situated a little above the umbilicus; sometimes a fourth one below the umbilicus. Unim- portant surgically. Linese Semilunares.—Correspond to the divi- sion of the abdominal aponeuroses to form the sheaths of the recti. It is over the upper part of the left one, just below the costal cartilages, that the incision is made for gastrostomy. Abdominal Aorta.— Bifurcates on the left side of the fourth lumbar vertebra, about an inch and a half belmo, and a little to the left of, the umbilicus, on a level with the highest part of the crest of the ilium.

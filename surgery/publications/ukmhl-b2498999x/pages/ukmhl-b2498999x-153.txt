In either case, the knife gets into the space bet\\ een the bladder and the rectum, where any amount of damage may be done. Before puberty, the prostate is rudimentary, the prostatic plexus of veins undeveloped, the perina)um, generally, thinner, and the kidney almost necessarily healthy. The operation is therefore much easier, and much more certain to succeed, than in the adult. Other Perinseal Operations. — Median, Bilateral, K,ecto-Vesical.—Much interest once attached to the above, as in them was thought to lie the solution of the alternate questions, on the one hand, how best to remove small stones, and, on the other, how best to remove ve?y large ones. But small stones are now invariably crushed, and, on the other hand, through the earlier recognition of stone in the bladder, and the improved treatment of stone by lithotrity, and more recently by lithalopaxy, those very largo stones are no longer met with in practice which were of frequent occurrence some fifty years ago. The above-named operations are therefore now abandoned tlu’ough tlie restriction of the area of applicability of perinscal lithotomy.

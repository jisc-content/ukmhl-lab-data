G3 limes called tlie loioer border) runs to the right from the apex to the lower part of the right border of the gladiolus; it rests upon the cordiform tendon of Ihe diaphragm. This border cannot be made out by percussion, on account of the subjacent liver. The upper part of the right border (sometimes called the right border-) runs from the gladiolus to the right extremity of the base. It is convex to the right, and nearly coincides with the right border of the sternum. The left border runs from the apex to the left extremity of the base, being somewhat convex to the left, but just escaping the left nipple. Valves of the Heart {after Holden).—'‘Tha aortic valves lie behind the third intercostal space, close to the left side of the sternum. The pulmonary valves lie in front of the aortic, behind the junction of the third rib, on the left side, with the sternum. The tricuspid valves lie behind the middle of the sternum, about the level of the fourth costal cartilage. The mitral valves (the deepest of all) lie behind the third intercostal space, about one inch to the left of the sternum.’’ Lungs.—Their apices rise behind the inner ex- tremity of the clavicle and sterno-mastoid as much as an inch or an inch and a half above the first rib. Their anterior borders meet in the middle line behind

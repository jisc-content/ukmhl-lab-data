38 patellar ligament. Care must be taken, in excising the hypertrophied bursa, not to open the capsule of the knee-joint. There is a bursa beneath the liga- mentum patella). Synovial Membrane of Knee-Joint.—Kises, in the extended position, about tivo inches above the upper border of patella, or even a little higher, especially on the inner side; in flexion it does not rise quite so high. Inferiorly, it descends as low as the upper part of the head of the fibula. It not unfrequently communicates with the synovial mem- brane of the superior tibio-fibular articulation. Popliteal Space. — Broad above, where it is bounded externally by the strong tendon of biceps passing down to the head of the fibula, and internally by the thin prominent tendon of the semitendinosus, internally to which is the thick rounded tendon of semimembranosus. Narrow below, where it is bounded on either side by the two heads of the gastrocnemius, the outer head having the plantaris beneath it. Bursae in Popliteal Externally, one beneath outer head of gastrocnemius, v-hich some- times, and one beneath tendon of popliteus, which almost always, communicates with knee-joint. Intcr- Jially, one beneath inner head of gastrocnemius (between it and semimembranosus and posterior liga-

T 104 extremity of the former incision, and over the outer aspect of tlie limb, to the lower part of the posterior fold of the axilla. The flap thus made is then turned up, and the capsule is exposed and divided, the humerus being rotated as above explained. The soft parts remaining on the inner side of the limb are now divided by cutting straight into the axilla; these soft parts, as they contain the axillary artery, being caught hold of by an assistant before the artery is divided. In the original oval method the first incision (handle of the racket) was made on the outer side of the limb, beginning on the acromion; this had the inconvenience of leaving the cicatrix in a somewhat exposed situation. ' j Parts Divided.—The vertical incision divides the anterior part of the ! deltoid, with the subjacent anterior circumflex artery, and twigs from ' the acromio-thoracic; the cephalic vein and the descending branch of j the acromio-thoracic artery ; a part of the insertion of the peotoralis major. The oblique incision on the outer side of the limb divides the ( outer and back part of the deltoid, the long head of the triceps, the teres major and latissimus dorsi, udth the posterior circumflex vessels and nerve. ‘ With the capsule there are divided the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The final cut into the axilla divides the previously undivided portion of the peotoralis major, the biceps and the coraco-braohialis, the axillary vessels, and the nerves to the upper limb When time is an object, as may be the case on the battle-field, the shoulder may be amputated by an external or deltoid flap, made, at least in its lower part, by transfixion.

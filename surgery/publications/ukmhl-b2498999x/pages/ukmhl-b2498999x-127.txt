121 ongus digitorum, with (in tlie case of the Sj-me) the two origins of the flexor accessorius; in the case of the Syme, either the internal and external plantar vessels and nerves, or possibly the posterior tibial, if the heel incision is made rather far back ; in the case of the PirogoCf, the internal and external plantar. Amputation of Lower Part of Leg.— Long anterior flap of skin and superficial fascia only; short (or no) posterior flap; partly saw tibia; while doing so, saw fibula; complete section of tibia. Saw off small portion of crest of tibia, or remove same with cutting pliers. This is the best place to do a Teak, especially if skin on dorsum of foot is healthy, and can be used to make the long anterior flap. Measure circumference of limb with piece of tape. Take half the piece, and lay same across front of limb, marking extremities of same with pen or pencil. Similarly mark out the two other angles of anterior or square flap by measuring downwards on either side of limb, and transversely below. Turn up soft parts down to the bone. Short posterior flap one-fourth of anterior— i.e., one-fourth of half circumference of limb. Amputation of Upper Part of Leg.— Circular ; or make two equal flaps of skin only, or or skin and a little muscle at upper part. First flap may be made antero-external, including soft parts from fibula to inner border of tibia; then the postero-internal flap may be made by transfixion. But such a flap is likely to be thick and heavy, and to I’etract too much.

17 Cutaneous Veins. —On the inner side of the artery, in its lower half, is the basilic vein, accom- panied by the internal cutaneous nerve. The cephalic vein runs in the groove on the outer side of the biceps, then between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, and finally opens into the axillary above the coracoid process. Musculo-Spiral Nerve and Superior Pro- funda Artery.—Wind obliquely round back of humerus a little above its middle. Below this, for three or four inches above the condyles, there is nothing to interfere with operations on the bone. Bend of the Elbow ,—In a muscular limb it forms a triangular depression, bounded internally by the pronator 7-adii teres, externally by the supinator longus, and above by the projection of the brachialis anticus and biceps. The tendon of the biceps can here be felt, with the brachial artery on its inner side; more internally is the median nerve. In front of the arteiy, separated from it by the bicipital or semilunar fascia, is the median basilic vein, running upwards and inwards, and accompanied by the anterior branches of the internal cutaneous nerve. Externally is the median cephalic vein, somewhat smaller, running upwards and outwards, accompanied by the anterior branches of the

i 64 the sternum between the levels of the second and fourth costal cartilages. Inferiorly, the anterior bordc7-of the right lung follows the line of the sixth costal carti- lage, while that of the IcftiB notched to expose the apex and lower part of the anterior surface of the heart. Laterally, the lung usually descends as low as the eighth rib ; posteriorly, as low as the ietith. In very deep insjnrations the lung descends an inch and a half lower. The litic of reflexion of the plciwa from the chest wall on to the diaphragm runs along the costal cai’tilages from the lower exti’emitj^ of the gladiolus to the lower border of the last rib, the pleura lining the inner surface of the latter. The Vertebral Spines.—Can be felt from the sixth cervical downwards, the spine of tlie seventli cervical vertebra being the most prominent (V. promi- , nens). The upper cervical spines, which lie in front of the ligamentum nuchro, recede too much from the j surface to be perceptible to the finger, except, pos- < sibly, the bifid extremity of the axis. The dorsal j spines lie in the median furrow caused by the projection j of the erectores spina). They do not lie on a level | with corresponding rib and corresponding vertebral ] body: each lies on a. level with the head of the rib ' and the body of the vertebra below. This is due to the obliquity of the dorsal spinous processes. The two lower dorsal spinous processes are less •A 't

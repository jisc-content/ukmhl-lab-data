132 On the left side of the body a similar operation is legitimate with reference to the carotid, which, how- ever, has the internal jugular vein closer to it, and more anterior, than is the case on the right side. With reference to the first part of the subclavian, the operation has also been performed, but only once, it is believed. The great depth of the artery, the extent to which it is covered by the pleura, the fact that it is crossed by the left innominate vein, and has both the pneumo-gastric nerve and the phrenic nerve in front of it, are circumstances which would deter most surgeons from undertaking the operation. Collateral Circulation.—The remark mode above in reference to the ligature of the carotida applies to the circulation of the right side of the head and neck, after ligature of the innominate. After this ligature, and after the ligature of the first part of the subclavian (internally to the vertebral), the circulation of the right upper limb would be carried on both through the inosculation of the two vertebrah, and through the collateral channels enumerated in the case of the ligature of the axillary. Excision of the Eyeball.—The stop^speculum being introduced, pick up a fold of conjunctiva, and divide with blunt curved scissors, first the upper, then the lower segment of the membrane near the margin of the cornea. With a strabismus hook, pick up the tendons, and divide them. Passing the curved scissors behind the globe, divide the optic nerve. After removing the eyeball, bring together the edges of the wound in the conjunctiva with a few delicate stitches. It is sometimes recommended to divide the external rectus first, leaving the tendo?i

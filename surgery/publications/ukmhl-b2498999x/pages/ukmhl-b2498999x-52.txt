46 Herophili. Gives attachment to the ligamentum nuchsB. Fi'om either side of it spring the superior curved lines of the occipital bone, which give attach- ment to the trapezius, sterno-mastoid, and occipito- frontalis. The inferior curved lines ai’e out of reach of the finger. Frontal SinuSGS-—Do not exist in childhood. They are formed, as age advances, by the separation of the two tables of the skull. The absence of the usual external prominence does not necessarily indicate the absence of the sinuses, which may be formed by the retrocession of the inner table of the skull. Neither does a prominent bump necessarily imply a large sinus. The same remark applies to the mastoid cells. Latoral Sinus.—Euns in its horizontal portion along a line drawn from the external occipital pro- tuberance to the external auditory meatus, grooving the posterior inferior angle of the parietal. In its descending portion it follows the anterior border of the mastoid process. Lower Levels of the Brain.—The line of the horizontal portion of the lateral sinus, prolonged along the posterior half of the lower border of the zygoma, marks the lower level of the posterior and middle lobes. The lower level of the anterior lobe is marked bv a line drawn through the superciliary

101 the upper half or the 5th metacarpal boue, and over the lower part of the ulna. Through this incision the extensor carpi ulnaris is divided, and the soft parts ai’e raised from the front and the back of the carpus and lower part of the ulna. The mode of dealing with the pisiform bone and with the unciform process of the unciform is a matter of some importance. It will be noticed that these bony points give origin to the muscles of the hypo- thenar eminence, and, further, that the pisiform bone, through giving attachment to the flexor carpi ulnaris, establishes a connection between the latter luuscle and the portion of the hand which is to be left. They must both be preserved. The unciform process is to be nipped off from the unciform bone with cutting pliers. The pisiform bone, after being separated from the cuneiform, is to have its articular surface removed with cutting pliers. The soft parts being raised as far as may be necessary, parts 3 and 4 of the opei’ation will become relatively easy. Amputation of the Forearm. — Place the fore-arm in a position intermediate between pronation and supination, and make two short flaps, one anterior and the other posterior. It will be noticed that, the limb being flattened from before backwards, the flaps need not be long. In the lower part of the forearm.

138 of the lip from the jaw for about a quarter of an inch on each side. With a drill the bone can then be perforated on each side of the median line, so as to admit of the two halves being subsequently drawn together with wire. The jaw is then divided in the median line with a saw. The section need not be completed with the saw; but the bone forceps may be used for the purpose, the slight irregularity often resulting being advantageous in maintaining the parts in apposition. The halves of the bone should be held asunder while the operator cuts the genio-hyo-glossi muscles from the jaw with a pair of scissors, leaving the attachment of the genio-hyoid muscles. With the forefinger and scissors the tongue can then be dissected from the floor of the mouth, with the sub- lingual glands and mucous membrane, until the hyoid bone is reached, firm traction being made with a stout string passed through the tip. The tongue being then drawn down, the palato-glossi muscles will be put on the stretch, and must be divided with scissors, after which a handled needle, around which the wire should be passed, should be passed through the tongue close to the hyoid bone. The screw of the ecraseur should be worked very slowly, or hsemorrhage may occur, and would be difficult to arrest, since both lingual arteries would probably be divided at the same time.” “ The operator should be prepared with a handled

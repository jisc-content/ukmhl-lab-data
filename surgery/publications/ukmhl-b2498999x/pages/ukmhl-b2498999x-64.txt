I 58 cartilage by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle. The Stylo-Hyoid and Posterior Belly of the Digastric.â€”Run obliquely downwards and forwards from the mastoid process to the hyoid bone. Beneath them passes the whole of the neuro-vascular bundle of the upper part of the neck. The hypoglossal nerve runs along their lower edge, and marks the point where the external carotid artery is usually tied. Above and in front of these muscles lies the super- ficial portion of the submaxillary gland. Beneath the submaxillary gland, in the angle between the two bellies of the digastric, is the anterior part of the hypoglossal nerve, just before it disappears beneath the mylo-hyoid. The nerve and the two bellies of the muscle bound a small triangular space, of which the lloor is formed by the hyo-glossus. The lingual artery crosses this space beneath the hyo-glossus muscle. The facial artc7j grooves the upper and back part of the submaxillary gland, and then crosses , the lower jaw in front of the masseter. Between the sternal and clavicular heads of the sterno-mastoid lie the common carotid artery in- ternally, and the internal jugular vein externally.

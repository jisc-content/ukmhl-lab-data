41 malleolus are the two peronei muscles, the brevis being in front of the longus. The sheaths of all the above tendons extend about an inch and a half above the malleoli. To keep clear of them in tenotomy, it is about two inches above the malleoli that the tendons should be cut. « Anterior Tibial Artery.—Somewhat smaller than the posterior. Euns along a line drawn from a point a little internal to head of fibula to midway between the kao malleoli, lying in succession between tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum, be- tween tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis, between tendon of extensor longus pollicis, which crosses it, and extensor longus digitorum. The an- terior tibial nerve is first on its outer side, then in front of it, then again to its outer side. It is deep above, and snperficial belou', where it can be felt beating upon the tibia midway between the two malleoli. Posterior Tibial Artery.—Somewhat larger than the anterior. Lies at first an inch external to inner border of tibia. It is here covered by inner head of gastrocnemius and solens, the latter muscle having a glistening layer of fascia on its anterior surface. Fn r t her down, it lies beneath skin and fascia only between tendo Achillis and inner border of tibia. In both situations it rests upon deep muscles of back of leg.

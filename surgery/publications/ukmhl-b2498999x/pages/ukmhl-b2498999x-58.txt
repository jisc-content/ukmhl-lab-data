52 'The Tongue.—is rough over the anterior two- thirds of its dorsum, and smooth posteriorly. On its under surface, in front of the frenum, it presents a narrow median furrow. On either side of this are the ranine veins; these indicate the position of the corresponding arteries. The middle line of the tongue is but slightly vascular. The Sublingual Glands.—Stand out on the floor of the mouth on either side of the frenum. On their inner side we find the sublingual artery, which is endangered when the frenum is too freely divided. Tendons of the Genio-Hyo-Glossi.—May be felt in the middle line of the floor of the mouth, just behind the jaw-bone. Their division allows the tongue to be drawn very freely out of the mouth, as may be necessary in the removal of a cancer of the organ.

Abnormal Obturator Artery.-Spine of ilium, Poupart’s ligament, glands of groin. —See “ Lower Limb.” Liver.— The greater part of its anterior border corresponds to the lower border of the right costal cartilages ; in the middle line, however, it descends to about midway between the ensiform cartilage and the umbilicus. Its convex surface rises on the right side, anteriorly, to about an inch below the nipple; posteriorly, to the tenth dorsal spine. On the left side it does not rise quite so high. The fundus of the gall bladder lies opposite the tip of the ninth costal cartilage of the right side. Stomach.—When empty, lies quite at the back of the abdomen, overlapped by the liver. When dis- tended, it turns upwards on its lesser curvature, its anterior and posterior surfaces becoming respectively superior and inferior, and its gi’eater curvature, an anterior border. The stomach then displaces con- tiguous organs in every direction, and occupies the greater part of the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions. The cardia, the least movable portion, lies just below the junction of the seventh left costal 3

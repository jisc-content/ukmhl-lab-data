146 finger; surgeon cuts tov^’ards it, dividing posterior fibres of left accelerator m’inas, left trausversus perinaei, probably left transverse perinaeal artery; perhaps a few fibres of the levator ani; inferior layer of deep perinrcal fascia. III. Groove in staff felt through membraneous por- tion of urethra with nail of left forefinger ; urethra punctured, dividing deej) trausversus perinaei, if it exist, and posterior fibres of compressor urethrae. lY. Knife pushed onwards in groove in staff,— dividing membraneous and prostatic portions of urethra, neck of bladder, and part of prostate gland. V. Kinger introduced into bladder; stone felt with finger ; staff withdrawn; forceps introduced ; stone extracted. Possible Accidents.—The bulb and its artery may be divided if the incision is begun too far forwards. (It will be borne in mind that the artery of the bulb may lie further back than usual, and that there may be an accessory pudic artery difficult to avoid.) The rectimi may be opened if it is not kept out of the way, or if the knife is turned too far inw ards; the entire breadth of the prostate with the pelvic fascia, the prostate plexus of veins, and the accessory pudic artery (if the latter exist) may be divided if the deep incision is too free; the pudic arteiy may possibly be divided where it rests on the pudic arch.

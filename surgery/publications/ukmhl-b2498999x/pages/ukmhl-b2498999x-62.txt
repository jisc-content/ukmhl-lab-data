56 Crico-Thyroid Membrane.—Is crossed Ly tlie small artery of the same name, a branch of the superior thyi-oid. In laryngotomy, the membrane is first exposed by a vertical incision, and then divided transversely close to the cricoid cartilage—that is, as far as possible from the vocal cords. Cricoid Cartilage.—Is the surgeon’s pidncipal guide in tracheotomy. Behind it the pharynx narrows into the commencement of the oesophagus. Foreign bodies frequently lodge at this point. The Trachea.—Kecedes from the surface as it descends. Unless the low division be specially indi- cated, the canal had better be opened as high as possible. The isthmus of the thyroid gland (which crosses the second, third, and fourth rings of the trachea) can be either drawn dov'n or divided; or the cricoid cartilage, with the two or three first rings of the trachea, may be divided (laryngo-tracheotomy). The Inferior Thyroid Veins.—Are neces- sarily distended when tracheotomy is required. They should be avoided as far as possible, and any abundant haemorrhage should be stopped before the trachea is opened. The left innominate vein rises somewhat dangerously high in front of the lower j^art of the trachea. In front of the trachea there is sometimes

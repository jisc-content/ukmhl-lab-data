113 terosseous membrane, keeping close to the tibialis anticus, so as not to get, as it is easy to do towards the middle of the leg, on the outer side of the ex- tensor proprius pollicis. The anterior tibial vessels and nerve will be found on the interosseous mem- brane, the nerve being more or less external to the artery. The aneurism needle should be passed from the outer side. At the lower part of the leg the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis crosses, and gets internal to, the artery; but it is best to draw the tendon outwards, and to seek the artery on its inner side. Collateral Circulation'.—The collateral circulation through the pos- terior tibial and peroneal is so free th.at its channels need scarcely be enumerated. One may note, however, the inosculation of the external plantar \rith the dorsalis pedis at the back part of the first interosseous space; and, at the ankle, the anastomosis of the anterior peroneal both with the external malleolar and with the tarsal and metatarsal, and tha of the internal plantar and internal calcanean with internal malleolar. Ligature of the Dorsalis Pedis Artery.— Incision from back part of first interosseous space nearly to a point midway between the two malleoli. Find the extensor proprius pollicis and the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum. Emerging from beneath the latter will be seen the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis. The artery lies be- tween the latter tendon, which crosses it towards its termination, and the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis. It is frequently concealed to some extent

114 by the layer of deep fascia which unites the sheaths of the adjoining tendons. The inner branch of the anterior tibial nerve lies on its outer side. It is best to pass the aneurism needle from the outer side. Ligature of tlie Popliteal Artery.—in- cision in the middle line of the popliteal space, mainly above the line of the articulation. Divide skin and fascia, avoiding the external or short saphenous vein. Flex the limb, so as to relax the hamstring muscles, and draw them apart. The internal popliteal nerve will probably be the first structure come upon. The popliteal vessels lie to its inner side, and deeper, resting on the femur in the inner part of the woimd. The vein is external and posterior to the artery, and close to it. The aneurism needle should be passed from the outer side. Collateral Circulation.—The articular arteries communicate freely one with the other. The superior external articular anastomoses with the descending branch of the external circumflex. Both superior articular anastomose with the ferf orating branches of the frofunda. Ligature of the Posterior Tibial Artery, Middle Third. —Incision about an inch from the inner border of the tibia. Identify the inner head of the gastrocnemius, and, consequently, the soleus, which lies beneath it. Cut carefully through the soleus, looking for the glistening layer of fascia on its anterior surface. Divide this on the director, and thus expose the layer of intermuscular fascia which

153 which the uppei' end of the ‘ button-hole ’ incision in the urethra may be drawn upwards. The staff being passed and held with the grooved side forwards, the surgeon cuts down upon it by an incision about 1^ in. long in the median line, and opens the urethra just above the stricture. The staff is now pushed out at the wound and turned round, so that the small hook is forwards: it is then drawn upwards so as to catch in the upper angle of the opening, and in this way the urethra is put on tlie stretch and steadied. If the special staff he not at hand, the end of a catheter can he cut down on with almost equal ease. The edges of the slit in the urethra are then seized in' artery-forceps and held apart so as to expose the interior of the canal, which can be readily recognised by its smooth shining surface. It will often be found to be convenient to pass a silk suture through each, side by which the edges may be held apart, as the forceps are rather apt to get in the way. Oozing having been allowed to cease, the aperture leading to the stricture will usually be found without very great difficulty. If a false passage have been opened in- stead of the urethra, it is recognised by the absence of the smooth pink mucous membrane. The orifice of the stricture must be sought for with a fine probe. Wheelhouse uses a small probe-pointed director. In some cases the small director used in slitting up the canaliculus will be found to pass when other instru-

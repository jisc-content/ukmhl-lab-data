Lisfranc’s, or Tarso-metatarsal Ampu- tation.—Left hand to grasp sole of foot, finger and thumb marking bases of 5th and 1st metatarsal bones, the former always easily felt (see p. 42). Dorsal incision slightly convex forwards between points named, i.e., a little forwards and inwards from base of 5th metatarsal bone. Long plantar flap, longest internally, extending as far as middle of ball of big toe, to be marked out by a deep cut running parallel to line of attachment of toes, but not com- pleted in the first instance. Disarticulate the three outer metatarsal bones (they lie in a line oblique forwards and inwards) and the 1st metatarsal bone (it lies just a little in front of the line of the three outer ones). To disarticulate the 2nd metatarsal bone intro- duce the point of the knife, blade upwards, into the back part of the first interosseous space; then, holding the knife as a dagger in stabbing, press it backwards so as to divide the interosseous ligament between the internal cuneiform and the base of the 2nd metatarsal, and at the same time press the front part of the foot downwards: the dorsal liga- ments being divided, the joint will open.

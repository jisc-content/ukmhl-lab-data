10 I do not think however that the Directors of this popu- larly-managed institution would, for one moment, object to their being relieved of the patronage which they now enjoy, in the appointment of dressers at least; and, if so, it is my intention, in the above respect, to follow in the footsteps of our continental friends and rivals, and to petition for free and open competition among all the candidates for this situ- ation. Thus, it will be seen who are the talented and indus- trious, and, at the same time it will place at the elbow of the attending surgeons a phalanx of young men who will greatly expedite their labours, and conduce much to promote the interests of the charity.* Most of the hospitals on the continent, which I had the opportunity of visiting, were remarkable for the appearance of cleanness and comfort which they presented to the eye of a stranger. In the former respect, they are, in my opinion, much indebted to the peculiar character of their female attendants, those " Sceurs de la charite" as they are called, a religious order of women, whose whole pleasure seems to be the temporal as well as spiritual benefit of those intrusted to their charge. These monastic-dressed and interesting female attendants, I found invariably at their duty; and whoever has visited those abodes of poverty and disease, and observed their assiduous and devoted attentions, and respect- able appearance, must have been struck with the superiority which they exhibit to the hired and careless menials at home. For the comfortable appearance of these hospitals, and those in London, I think, they are much indebted to the unlimited use of that, which in this establishment, in many respects so superior, would be a great addition. I mean bed curtains, which, in both medical and surgical cases, particu- larly in the females wards, would prevent many unpleasant and disagreeable exhibitions, tend much to quiet the fears of â€¢ Though the patronage as to dressers is still in the hands of the Directors, yet I have always found my recommendation of those deemed the best qualified for this office, a sufficient guarantee, for preferment. On this account I think the above change less necessary.

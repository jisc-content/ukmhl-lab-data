16 clamour of those who are wilfully blind to the result likely to arise from their salutary measures.* As to the importance of the study of clinical surgery, and the advantages attending its cultivation, these are so obvious that the very youngest, now hearing me, must be immed- iately impressed with them. Compare, as you will soon have the opportunity of doing, the surgery which you may have read in books, or even heard in lectures, with that which will be brought under your observation at the bed side of the patient, and the difference will not fail to strike the most careless. Many of the publications which have issued from the press, both in former and more modern times, upon the most important points in surgery, are so confused and contradictory that I have often been led to think that the student would do better not to trouble himself with them at all; but read at first only in the great volume of nature, where alone correct information is to be obtained. Indeed, without this observation of nature's processes at the patient's bed side, and the reasoning which must of necessity follow on every case which meets your view, and where your feelings in every scene of affliction are so much interested, the lessons attempt- ed to be enforced, elsewhere, must fall, I fear, with listless- ness on the ear. Without this careful study of the variety of symptoms, and modifying circumstances, of each particu- lar case, arising from their causes, their combinations, con- stitutional peculiarities, progress, &c. your future practice will be stained by empiricism, and your success in after life, in proportion, problematical. As to lectures on surgery, as they are sometimes delivered in the schools, they are, in my opinion, of very little ad- vantage, consisting as they have done, of theory manufac- tured in the study, the fruit perhaps of a brilliant imagina- tion, than drawn from real life, and the result of careful * The revenue to the hospital from the above source, so far from diminishing in consequence of these enactments, as some supposed, has increased beyond any former period since the foundation of the establishment; and this, in a greal measure, from the additional number of pupils attracted by the great blank in the medical and surgical education in this otherwise celebrated school being now

13 these last, so far as I could observe, were quite unknown. Yet, notwithstanding-all this, we observe our Royal Colleges, our Faculties, and our Army and Navy Boards, issuing edicts daily concerning " the necessity of clinical surgery and practi- cal anatomy," and some learned bodies, nearer home, have even gone the length of parenthising " actual dissection" as necessary before being taken on trials; but never one word is said all the while about the impossibility of the poor student obtaining such a qualification; or, if so, at what a price, or at what hazard of life and reputation. Now, I feel quite convinced that unless there is a change of a very decided kind effected, and that speedily too, upon the laws of this country with regard to dissection, the stu- dent will find it much more beneficial, and even more eco- nomical, at once to acquire a knowledge of the language of our rivals, and betake himself to their capital, where he can obtain, without cash, all his classes and hospitals; and as for dissection he may have as much as he can make a good use of for a trifle,* but which in his own country would amount to a sum equal at least to his whole expenditure. I speak not unadvisedly; for it was the method I myself took to obtain that which I in vain attempted at home, and which I deem indispensable, that frequent dissection of every part of the human body, which.an abundant sup- ply of subjects can alone furnish.f This is a very dismal state of matters; but I sincerely hope that brighter prospects are awaiting you all, and that the time is not far distant when prejudice shall yield to science its proper objects, The price of subjects in Paris is generally about 7 francs; and, if the blood vessels are injected, 3 francs more is charged; in all about 8s. The price of subjects in tins country is quite arbitrary: sometimes I have known them ad valorem as h.gh as £10, 10s. at other times they are not to be procured for either love or money. r til. ^ ^ P''eSe"u-den°,un0t!S !t RS fe,«"y either to resurrect, or encourage fcose who engage ,n h.s infernal occupation : yet, as has often been strongfy feted, tb* law must be v.olated, before the laws above alluded to, and enforced with the grea est seventy on those medical men entering the Army or Navy, or todeed the profession generally, can be complied with !

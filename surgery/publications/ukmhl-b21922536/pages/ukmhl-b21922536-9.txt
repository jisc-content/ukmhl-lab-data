7 direct relief, they, at the same time, prove of incalculable benefit to society at large, by the advantages which they present for the cultivation of surgical science. I can no where ascertain at what period, in the history of hospitals, pupils were first admitted to observe the practice of the attending surgeons; but, from the fact of almost all the advancement which surgery has made, during the last two centuries, having been effected through the instrumen- tality of these talented individuals, who were invariably to % be found in attendance upon them, it must be evident that, at a very early date, they were regarded as the best practical schools for the improvement of both masters and students. Take a survey of the great surgeons of the last century— of Cheselden, Pott, Hey and Hunter, in our own country, and of Sabatier, Petit, Desault and Scarpa, on the Continent—and who among them would have been regarded as standard authorities in their profession, unless they had enjoyed that extensive experience, and those numerous opportunities of performing surgical operations, which hospitals alone are calculated to confer ? And, in our own times, this superiority in skill, and this dexterity in operating, is still more con- fined to hospital surgeons than at any previous period of our art; for, whether we look to France, and there see Dupuytren monopolizing operative surgery, both public and private, or to Great Britain, and here follow in the footsteps of a Cooper, an Abernethy, or a Lawrence, the fact must be admitted that, while the rich make choice of those men who, on all hands, are acknowledged as the highest in the scale of professional attainments, the poor in our hospitals are at the same time the recipients of their attentions, and the instruments by which all their well-earned fame, and highly valued skill, has been acquired. But, while hospitals have in all ages been the best stepping stones to private practice and celebrity, have they, either at home or abroad, been the means, in the hands of the attend- ing surgeons, of conveying to the minds of the students all that instruction for which they are so well calculated, or for correcting all those erroneous notions which lectures and

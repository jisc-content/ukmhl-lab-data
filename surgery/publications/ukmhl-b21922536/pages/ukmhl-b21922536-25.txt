23 have been the consequence, if, by a slovenly examination, ignorance such as I have described, had been allowed to pass ? Why, the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons would have been disgraced, the candidate, would, through stupidity, and, which is worse, presumption, have been rivetted to his follies, and the public would, in the long-run, have been the miserable dupes and sufferers. To obviate, in some measure, therefore, such like scenes, to make all those pupils who go the round with me, conversant with my cases, I propose to give certificates of attendance to those only who deserve it, after individual and private examination, at the end of each quarter, as during last summer. By this means, though more laborious and fatiguing to myself, the most modest, as well as the most confident, is stripped of a single apology for absence, and, I at the same time, by this procedure, not only save the trouble daily of calling the catalogue, but, which is of greatest moment, command your mental as well as bodily presence, at the bed sides of my patients.* In the practice of this hospital, as of all others, you will find, that the daily visit is by far the most useful, and the regular duties the most important; for it is to be presumed, that he who can operate with dexterity, will also be the person, who with most success, can perform his minor and more laborious duties. Yet, sorry am I to say, such is the rage for opera- tions, such the importance which seems to attach to them, that, though the least part of the profession, they seem to take a firmer hold of the public mind, and strike a deeper impres- sion on the pupil's senses than the daily cures performed; they in fact usurp an importance in education which does not belong to them; the surgeon, instead of being valued according to his talents, sense and general information, is praised only in proportion as he operates with boldness and dexterity. * A great majority of the above have lately availed themselves of the oppor- tunity of waiting upon me, and submitting to this test, not so much of their abilities as of their industry; and I rejoice to say now, without in the least flattering their vanity, that with one or two exceptions, I have found much, both to pmise and admire in the acuteness of observation, and the uniform assiduity which has been displayed by them, during their clinical course.

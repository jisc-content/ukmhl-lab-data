11 the nervous and irritable, and, in many cases, prove a soporific of a far more agreeable kind, than all the anodynes in the materia medica. That there are objections to their use, both in an economic and healthful point of view, I am well aware; but the advantages which I observed to result, from their use, more than counterbalanced any expense or risk of contagion which, by some, might be dreaded.* In most of the continental hospitals I remarked also that convalesence was much more attended to than in this country; and, for promoting this desirable object, there are, in many of these establishments, such as those of Paris, Milan, &c. galleries round the wards, the roofs being of immense height, and, in many others, as those of Pavia, Bologna, Naples, &c. covered walks, where, at all times, the patients may have the advantage of recreation. Now, if on the continent, and, particularly in Italy, where the weather is so dry and genial, and the barometer so steady, it is thought of so much advan- tage to the recovery of the inmates that every hospital almost has its gallery or covered walk, how much more necessary must it be here, where, during the year, we have such continued rain and storms, and where such a varia- tion of atmosphere prevails, as to preclude the inmates from taking that inhalation of pure air, and that salutary recrea- tion, so indispensable to their convalesence, and so essential to their perfect recovery ? I feel convinced that the advan- tages of these measures need only to be pointed out, to the liberal managers of this Infirmary, to be immediately complied with. But, not to detain you any longer with the general man- agement of continental hospitals, I proceed to say a few words as to their surgical state; and here I must admit, at the outset, that there was nothing which impressed me so much as the superior industry, at least of the attending surgeons, compared to that exhibited by those of my own â€¢ Since the above was delivered, I have memorialized the Directors on the subject of curtains ; and I rejoice to say, that I found them unanimously favour- able to their limited use; but irresistible opposition was encountered from a quarter from which I least expected it.

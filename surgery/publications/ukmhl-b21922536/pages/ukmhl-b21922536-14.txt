12 native city, or indeed native country, and at the same time of the great utility of that uninterrupted and interesting series of clinical lectures which all the hospital students, without fee, had the opportunity of enjoying. Figure to yourselves the first surgeon in France making his appearance, pointedly and regularly, at six o'clock a. m. (which by the bye is rather too much of a good thing) at the bed side of his first patient in the Hotel Dieu, calling all his dressers before him, and receiving from them a summary of the cases under their charge: now, follow him (with turned-up sleeves and dressing gown thrown round him) to the wards, and there observe him going his rounds, of sometimes upwards of three hun- dred patients; but this is not all; for at nine o'clock, (by which hour in general the whole of the above number of patients had been visited by him,) he marched into the opera- tion room; and there I have frequently seen him perform operations, and thereafter give a clinical lecture till well on to mid-day. Search our schools and hospitals here, and see if any such enthusiasm is any where to be found, or any such information by those in attendance is to be obtained ! But it is not only in a surgical point of view that I would wish to call your attention to the importance of the hospitals of France and Italy; for I look upon the advantages which the student derives from them, in regard to anatomy as of superior moment; for such is the law that any dead body which remains unclaimed, in any of the hospitals, after a certain number of hours, is x-emoved for the use of the students of anatomy, and may be obtained at an expense which the poorest among them can always defray. It may be very well to talk about the surgeons of our own country being as able, and our schools and hospitals as well supplied with teachers, as those of the continent; but where I would ask, is practical surgery so explained and enforced, or at what school is a knowledge of anatomy so easily obtained.'' I can safely say not in this country, where, in general, I have observed that he is accounted the most expert who gets through his work the fastest; and, as for explanation of wha< is going forward, or any thing in the shape of clinical lectures,

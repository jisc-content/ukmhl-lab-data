25 falsehood takes its place ? For I fear that no situation, how- ever arduous, and no conduct, however straight-forward, will shield their possessors from the malevolence of those whose only amusement seems to be the lasceration of the most ami- able and exalted of natures. I most sincerely hope, however, that those days of darkness have gone by, and that hospital medical men, as they have all along been, will still be charac- terized as the most liberal of their brethren, and the fore- most in the ranks of charity and philanthropy. In conclusion, I have only to remark, that if any of you should, at any time, think yourselves aggrieved, or have the least fault to find, either with the regulations of the house, or the servants belonging to it, you have only to make your complaints to me, or any of my colleagues, and we shall do all in our power to find you redress; for, in my opinion, nothing conspires so much to mutual good will and improve- ment, as candour, and frequent kindly intercourse, between all parties.

17 induction. Well do I remember, when a student at a uni- versity not far distant, that the learned professor began his course of surgery with stone in the bladder, delivered some twelve or fifteen lectures on this (it must be confessed) very important disease, and finished with hernia, and those two subjects occupied almost the whole of the surgical course in those days. At present, matters are very much changed, under the talented and experienced professor of surgery in our university, and many more topics are introduced. Still however I am of opinion that the student, who is well directed, will learn more in one week in the wards of an hospital, such as this, than during a whole session of attendance on surgical lectures, however ably written, or amusingly, or eloquently, enforced. Surgery, to be well taught, ought, I think, to be less a treatise, than a demonstration of disease, rather a des- criptive lecture, than an assemblage of precepts or theories. Better would it be for the student to know nothing of surgi- cal diseases than have to correct his impressions, received in the lecture room, by those in the hospital. You may be told in the class room, of inflammation, and its consequences; and, as is generally the case, much of your valuable time, may be taken up, with fine-spun theories on this all-engrossing subject; but only present to your eye, a patient, who has just made his appearance from some of our magnificient manufactories, and lies in our accident ward, with his leg, it may be, shattered by some steam engine gearing, and what now are your sensations? what your interest? and what, in fine, the instinctive reasoning on the case; here, you must have inflammation, and perhaps m all its stages, and all its varieties, and tell me now whether what is seen, touched and properly commented on, at the bed side, does not ten thousand times more strongly rivet your regards, than all which you may previously have heard on the subject? Again, as to the diagnostic department of our art, in the umversity, you may be told, with all the eloquence of a Demosthenes, what hernia is, what are its causes, what its symptoms, and what are its bottled or dried morbid appear-

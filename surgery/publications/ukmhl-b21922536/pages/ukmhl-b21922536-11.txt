9 research, have thus furnished them with the ground work upon which so goodly a fabric of medical and surgical obser- vations has been erected. Attached to each hospital, are a certain number of perma- nent and temporary medical officers, the former consisting of the physicians and surgeons, and the latter of the clerks and dressers. In regard to the permanent situation of the chief medical attendants, I am of opinion that the practice, both in Paris and London, has many advantages over that which prevails in this institution, where, at first, the attend- ing surgeons only remained at their post for three months. This was latterly extended to six months; and, last year, the Directors very judiciously extended the period of attend- ance to one year, proving, if any proof were wanting, that the longer the attendance the greater will be the skill ac- quired, and the more complete and matured the practical knowledge to be communicated.* All the medical officers in attendance on the hospitals in Paris are elected, to their various situations, in a manner so ' admirable, and so much superior to that system of patronage and cabal, which unfortunately too frequently prevails in our own country, that I cannot refrain from adverting to it for a moment. When any vacancy occurs, candidates, by public advertisement, are called on to enrol themselves before a certain day, when a jury of medical men, after a great variety of trials of the respective aspirants, both in public and private, > confer the appointment. This practice of popular election [ renders the various public offices, either in schools or hospitals, of much more importance in France, than any similar ones in this country, where, generally, it is money more than talents, and interest rather than diligence, which obtains the victory. * From the scarcity of what is called pure physicians in this city, as well as from the skill and experience of those in attendance at present in this infirmary, the above office has been monopolized, or rather I should say has been pressed on the acceptance of a very few individuals, who have attained the highest medi- cal honours; the remaining M. D.'s choosing occasionally to handle the lancet. uvght this pure exclusive system to continue? B

19 Theory without practice you will very soon find to have only a short-lived existence—that of to-day giving place to that of to-morrow, and both soon forgotten—but observation of nature, and her processes, must ever prove useful, and instructive; and her laws admit of no change. Surgery may, in this respect, be aptly compared to some gigantic pyramid, reared amid the ages which have passed, whose base and centre, founded and cemented by the observation of facts, have withstood the torrents of time, but whose sides and summit, loosely joined and crowned by crude speculation, have gradually crumbled into dust, leaving no vestige of the hands which formed them. But though I have thus spoken of theory without practice, I must at the same time inform you, that principles, carefully deduced, and well digested, are equally indispensable to the proper practice of your profession. Without those lights to guide you, empiricism must characterise your whole conduct, and rotinism, with all its evils, stamp your every abortive effort at cure. The rectifying of both these blunders is the great object of hospital surgery, in which your attention will be pointed to diseases as in nature they are to be found; and, thus, taking it for granted that you know something of the rudiments of your profession, theory and practice are, in our wards, made to assist and correct each other. Every patient who enters under our charge will thus, in a manner, be a natural book, in which you will be able to read for yourselves what actually occurs, to think and judge for yourselves what remedies ought to be had recourse to, and the result to be expected; and when you do at last enter upon practice, you will find yourselves, as it were, at home—little presenting itself either strange or difficult, your previous diligence in nature's school, having stamped in your mind, that, which no system of oral instruction, can ever communicate. With respect to the advantages of this infirmary as a school of practical surgery, I think they are both numerous and important; for, whilst in the great capitals, such as Lon- don, Paris, &c. the surgical patients are distributed over many hospitals, they are here concentrated into one.

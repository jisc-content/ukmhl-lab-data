24 Let me therefore again warn you of the necessity of exam- ining for yourselves every case, and at the same time, with the greatest circumspection. Let not one single sinister obser- vation escape you, calculated cither to hurt my own feelings, or to upset that confidence in the minds of my patients, so necessary to their cure. As to your conduct in this amphi- theatre, during the performance of surgical operations, I hope that it will continue to be characterised by that decorum, so becoming the place, and which I have found so necessary, to the operator's composure of mind, and steadiness of hand. For the accomplishment of this very desirable object, I shall take as much care as possible, that no obnoxious head, or obtrusive body, be interposed between you and the patient; the neglect of which sympathy, for the laudable curiosity of the pupil, has, I believe, been the main cause of those dis- graceful scenes, too often exhibited in our metropolitan hos- pitals, and the fertile source, of much of the vituperation and abuse displayed in some of our periodical journals.

I mean, when, instead of the banner of truth, that of falsehood is unfurled, when licentiousness, rather than liberty, is adopted as its motto, and when calumny and slander, instead of candour and fair dealing, are wielded as its weapons. I may indeed be told that truth is great, and it shall prevail; but how often do we find that varnished

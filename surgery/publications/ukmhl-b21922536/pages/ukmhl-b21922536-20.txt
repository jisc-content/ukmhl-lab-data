18 ances, &c. and this is all very well; but let a patient make his appearance in our waiting room, for advice only, let him retire behind the ominous screen, down stairs, and there uncover his disease; who among you, that has only heard cut-and-dry lectures on surgery, will now be able to say what disease the poor sufferer labours under, and what ought to be done ? You see that there is swelling of the scrotum, some appearance of obscure fluctuation, some pain, and bowels rather constipated, you take him to the ward, and with your trocar and cannula puncture what, in your specu- lative notion, you supposed hydrocele, when, behold, no water flows: you get confused, agitated and alarmed; and so you may! you have got into a herniary sac, you have dashed into the intestine, and the miserable sufferer is doomed, if not to death, at least to a fate more horribleâ€”to an incurable and loathsome artificial anus. With respect to operations on the dead subject, as per- formed in the class room, I shall add, that you require to be present in this amphitheatre, for only a few moments during an operation on the living, to be instantly struck with the difference. In the lecture room, all is smooth, all natural, and it may be beautifully dissected, all calm and steady as a rock. On the other hand, here, all is agitation, the parts about to be the subject of operation, confounded, displaced, and irregular, all the frame of the unfortunate and sensitive sufferer, is unsteady, and cries, which would melt the most obdurate, too often pierce the heart, and unnerve the hand of the most skilful and determined. All our ideas of external objects are vague, until they are presented to our senses, until the animated picture of real existence is exhibited; then, but not until then, can we, with any degree of accuracy, say what this or that disease is; and, in proportion to the magni- tude of the gallery which you have the advantage of attending, and the number, variety, and importance of the living plates of disease which meet your observation, if I may so express myself, so will you be able afterwards to advance to the practice of your profession, with comfort and satisfaction to yourselves, and advantage and success to those intrusted to your charge.

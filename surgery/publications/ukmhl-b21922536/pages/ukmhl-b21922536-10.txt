8 books so often disseminate ? I fear notâ€”else, why should I have found, in my researches on this subject, that the first year of the French revolution was that in which Desault first taught the medical world the superiority of clinical instruction at the Hotel Dieu ? and, in spite of obloquy and reproach, continued to lecture at the bed side of his patients, or, immediately after his visits, in the operating theatre, on those cases, which, from their delicacy, he was prevented ,from commenting on in the wards. Since his time, the same valuable course of practical surgery has continued to be given not only in the Hotel Dieu, but in almost all the other hospitals on the Continent, which, not very long ago, I had the opportunity of visiting; and, perhaps, before adverting to the state of matters nearer home, it may not be out of place, in me, here, to give you a very short account of some of those institutions, and their surgical attendants; as, in my opinion, it is to the former that we are indebted for the best specimens of surgical arrangement, and to the latter, as ex- hibiting the best examples of clinical lecturers. Almost all the hospitals in the French metropolis are sup- ported and directed by the government of the country, differing, in this respect, from similar establishments here, where, with few exceptions, they are endowed and managed by the public at large. In Paris there is a central board of administration, where patients must first apply, and from which, lines of admission are granted them, to the various hospitals, judged most adapted to their respective diseases. If we compare this arrangement with the indiscriminate admissions, which prevails in all the London hospitals, the advantages must appear very obvious; for, by this means, the medical or surgical attendants, attached to the various hospitals, and who may wish to follow out any train of investigation, are put immediately in possession of those cases most suited to their purpose. It is to this admirable arrange- ment, I think, that the medical world are, in a great measure, indebted for the admirable works of Corvisart, Laennec, Alibert, Baylc and Broussais, whose hospitals, containing nil the choice cases, the object of their individual and undivided

Opinion of Velpeau. Parisian in advance of some London surgeons. Wound of internal carotid; by Br. Twitchell. Operative process described; case by Dr. Keith. 211. Thk precept so strongly insisted upon, that no operation should be done on a wounded artery unless it bleeds, and at the place from which it bleeds, has been particularly opposed with reference to the neck, the opponents believing that placing a ligature on the primitive carotid is an operation not attended with much risk, and may therefore be done as a precautionary measure when the wounded part does not bleed; which state- ment is an error. Of thirty-eight cases collected by Dr. Norris in 1847, in which this vessel was tied for aneurism, twenty-six died, and twelve suffered from affection of the brain, the fre- quency of which occurrence has been singularly overlooked by practical surgeons, and proving, in a very marked manner, that the operation of tying the primitive carotid is not a trifling affair, and that the success, when compared with the failures, is only as one and one. A much more important objection is the diffi- culty of deciding, in many cases of wounds of the neck, what artery is wounded, and what trunk should be tied; whether it be the external carotid or its branches, or the internal, or the vertebral artery; errors have been committed on all these points by men of the greatest anatomical and surgical knowledge; the trunk of a sound artery having been tied instead of that of a wounded one, inflicting thereby on the patient a second

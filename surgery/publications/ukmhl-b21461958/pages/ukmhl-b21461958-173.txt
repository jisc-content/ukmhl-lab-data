Constitutional and Local Remedies. 161 as taking place on the surface of an ulcer, the febrile symptoms should precede the changes in the ulcerated surface. That the febrile symptoms do appear to follow the appearance of the local alteration is in many cases indisputable; that they precede or accompany the local symptoms in many other cases is indubitable; and that the disease in a mild state, although yet capable of committing much mischief, is neither preceded nor followed by febrile or constitutional symptoms, cannot be doubted. The febrile symptoms themselves differ essentially from each other when they do occur, generally partaking the character of the endemic fever prevailing in the country at the season in which they appear. The fever is sometimes in- flammatory, sometimes typhoid, and occasionally resembles the bilious remittent of the summer and autumn in hot climates, and ends in typhus. It is probable that a want of attention to these circumstances has decided the opinions entertained by different individuals as to the general character of the febrile symptoms, and of the treatment to be pursued for their re- moval. That this disease was generally considered a consti- tutional complaint, until nearly the end of 1813, must be admitted; and it was the very indifferent success which at- tended its treatment by constitutional means and simple detergent applications, which caused the surgeons of the British army to view it more as a local disease, capable of giving rise to severe constitutional symptoms; a change of opinion which was materially influenced by the knowledge that the French surgeons, with Pouteau, more generally con- sidered that it was, in the first instance, local, and treated it by the actual cautery. In my hands, constitutional treatment, and every kind of simple mild detergent applications, always failed unless accompanied by absolute separation, the utmost possible extent of ventilation, and the greatest possible atten- tion to cleanliness; and not even then, without great loss of parts in many instances; this induced me, at Santander, in November and December, 1813, to try the mineral acids, not as then generally used as stimulants or detersives, but as caustics. This proceeding was always, however, accompanied by a constitutional treatment, regulated by the nature of the symptoms, which at that station were never benefited by p 2

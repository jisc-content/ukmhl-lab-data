Peculiar Circular Form. 160 rapidly extending towards each other, until they constitute one whole. The red of the granulations hecomes of a more violet colour, and the change is accompanied by a burning pain, not usually felt in the part, while a layer of ash-coloured matter is soon seen covering them, which adheres so firmly as not to be readily removed; or, if separated, shows that it is a substance formed upon the surface, and constituting a part of the granulations themselves, which are ultimately con- founded within it. About the end of the first week, and sometimes much later, this kind of ulcer becomes more painful, the edges or the circumference of the wound assume a browner hue, and the parts become somewhat pasty, the whitish colour of the part particularly affected being opaque, grey, and soft. It may be said that the false membrane having become very thick, has lost the little vitality it possessed, and become putrid; the discharge, which had been partly suppressed, now re-appears, not as pus, but as a foetid ichor, exhaling the peculiarly offen- sive stench of this disease. This pulpy, yellowish, putrid substance becomes thicker, and extends deeply: it invades the whole substance of a muscle, under which a probe may be passed, and the instrument brought out through it, with the loss, perhaps, of some strife of blood, from parts which are not yet actually destroyed; the mass is, however, adherent, although its extent diminishes by the putrefaction and wasting away of its surface. There are two characters always peculiar to this disease, in which it differs from all other gangrenous ulcers from ordi- nary causes; these are, the circular form it assumes after a very few days, even in its slighter varieties, and its peculiar odour or stench. 167. If this disease were entirely a local complaint, caused by the application of a morbid poison, giving rise to the destructive changes described on the surface of an ulcer, it should be only followed by febrile or constitutional symptoms at the end of several days; and Delpech is disposed to think that in such cases these constitutional symptoms take place from and after the sixth day. If it were entirely a constitu- tional disease, giving rise to the destructive changes described

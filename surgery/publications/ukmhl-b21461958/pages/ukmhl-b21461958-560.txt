550 Artificial Anus. from the falling in especially of the posterior part of the lower end, to which the upper has become united. The pro- jection thus formed in the tube is called by the French eperon, or promontoire, valve or spur, ridge, or septum; it directs the fcecal matter through the external wound, whilst it obstructs its passage into the lower part of the bowel. There is generally great difficulty in ascertaining the fact of the existence and exact situation of this valve during life; in distinguishing the upper from the lower end of the intestine, as well as the nature and extent of the adhesions by which the injured intestine is retained in its situation. If the absence of such a valve can be satisfactorily made out—and it is sometimes wanting—the external opening may be successfully closed by compression, or by operation. If the valve should exist, its removal by a preliminary operation is necessary; it has been attempted in France with various but somewhat doubtful success. 402. When a portion of small intestine has been lost by mortification or otherwise, and the patient has recovered with an unnaturally situated or artificial anus, the intestine, although at first in contact with the wall of the abdomen, is gradually, in many cases, though not in all, retracted into the cavity; it has been supposed, by the dragging of the mesentery upon it at the point of union of the divided extremities outside where the eperon or valve is formed; and it is said that this dragging has even led to the gradual disappearance of the valve, admitting thereby of the contents passing more readily from the upper part of the intestine into the lower, and consequently laying the foundation of a cure. This dragging of the intestine, or its movements under the different motions of the body, in some cases cause an elongation of the membrane formed under the adhesive process, by which the intestine is attached to the inside of the wall of the abdomen, in the same manner as adhesions are elongated between the pleurae, and a sac or pouch is thus formed between the cut ends of the intestine and the fistulous external opening which Scarpa was the first fully to demon- strate and explain, and which he called an intonnoir, infundi- bulum, or funnel. If then, in an old case, a small portimi of the wall of the abdomen be removed, in the form of a V, the

Peculiar Illustrative Case. 202 right common iliac artery of a lady of middle age for a swelling in the hip, supposed to be a glutseal aneurism, and which, after commencing the operation, was found to occupy a considerable part of the iliac region. The lady died a year afterwards, and it was then found that the ligature had been applied at the distance of five-eighths of an inch from the bifurcation of the aorta, and three-eighths of an inch above the origin of the internal iliac, independently of the line of separation between the parts of the iliac divided by the liga- ture, and which did not seem to be wider than the ligature itself. The separated ends were united at the point of separa- tion by new matter, the orifice or end of each being closed by a very narrow barrier, the inner coat of the artery being redder than natural, somewhat irregular and contracted, and containing hardly any coagulum, thus proving the fact, in the largest artery in the body save one, that a coagulum is not necessary for the safety of the union, while the immediate vicinity of so large a vessel as the internal iliac, to say nothing of the aorta itself, also proves that the danger hitherto ex- pected from the neighbourhood of a collateral branch is more imaginary than realâ€”two great facts the practice of the Peninsular war led me to declare, and which can no longer be doubted. The preparation exemplifying these points is in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, together with the ligature still carrying in its noose the portion of the artery it strangu- lated and brought away with it. 187. A ligature should always be round and small; provided it be sufficiently strong. The strength of a ligature is variously estimated; some surgeons trying it by the strength of their own fingers, others by what they conceive to be the resisting power of the coats of the artery, in which perhaps they may err. The only way in which a surgeon can hope to acquire correct information on this point, is by trying on the dead body what force of fingers is required to cut the inner coats of arteries of various sizes; and then taking the least force required for this purpose, to ascertain whether he can easily pull the ligature over, or off the divided end of the artery. If a surgeon will take the trouble to do this, he will find that

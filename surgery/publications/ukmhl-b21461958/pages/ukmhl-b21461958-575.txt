565 Wounds of the Penis. there is usually some injury done at the same time to the corpora cavernosa, and the part becomes contracted, and curved when distended. I have not seen any of these cases since the introduction into practice of the methods which have been recommended by DiefFenbach and others for the formation of a new urethra by borrowing from the neighbour- ing partsj but several might certainly have been benefited by such treatment. A married soldier, of the 29 th Regiment, was wounded on the heights of Rolica, in August, 1808, by a small musket- ball, which went through both corpora cavernosa from side to side. The man suffered very little inconvenience, and the wounds healed very well. He seemed to consider the injury as of no importance to himself, but had some idea there might be a difference of opinion in another party. There is usually a deficiency of substance at the part, after such wounds, and sometimes an inconvenient curve or twist, such as often takes place when the corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum are injured or raptured from other causes. coo

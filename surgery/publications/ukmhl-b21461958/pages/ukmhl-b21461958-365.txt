Gun shot Wounds of the Skull have Peculiarities. 355 tion depending on the presence of a spicula of bone, which has passed through the dura mater, and is irritating the brain beneath. It has been supposed that the danger would be diminished if the pia mater were wounded also, as the brain would project and fill the wound; but the accuracy of this opinion may be doubted; if the dura mater were injured through error or design, I should not think the evil lessened by adding to it a wound of the pia mater, and perhaps also of the brain. By those who have been accustomed to the terrible injuries which occur in military warfare, in which large portions of the brain are sometimes exposed, and even lost, without much in- convenience following; the exposure of, or the opening into the dura mater, is not considered of so much importance as it is by those who have had no opportunities of seeing such awful cases; whilst the formation and retention of matter below the bones of the cranium is, on the other hand, more dreaded by those who have often seen their ill effects, than by those who have had fewer occasions for observing them; by whom, however, they are often considered, when they do take place, to be irremediable by art. 280. Gun-shot wounds of the skull are attended by certain peculiarities. In ordinary circumstances there is usually an external wound and a fracture more or less comminuted, with depression; this wound will almost always require to be en- larged by a simple incision, so as to show the extent of the depression or the size of the broken and depressed portions of bone. When the bone is scarcely injured, and the periosteum is only bruised, or when the bone is even deprived of this covering, it does not follow that it should die or even exfoliate. In many instances the wound will gradually close in and heal, as if no such evil had occurred; and in those which do not terminate so favourably, the cure may only be delayed by the exfoliation of a layer or scale of bone from its outer surface, unless the mischief should have implicated the parts beneath. A musket-ball striking directly against a bone sometimes makes a hole not larger than itself, with or without any radiat- ing fracture; and one large trephine, if properly applied, will often embrace the whole of the mischief, and admit of the

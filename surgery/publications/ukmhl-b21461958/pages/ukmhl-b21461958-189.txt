External Coats of Arteries. 177 sented by line 4 in the circular diagram, is formed of strong elastic fibres difficult of separation, and when torn across, have curled extremities, as shown in the diagram marked 4, differ- ing only in size from those found in the ligaments of the spine, and in the ligamentum nuchse of quadrupeds, as shown in the separate diagram marked 4. The external coat of an artery divided also into two layers is shown on the circular diagram by lines 5 and 6. These two layers are composed of the yellow elastic fibres last noticed, and another set of fibres, white in colour and inelastic in struc- ture, arranged in various directions; the inner layer predomi- nating in yellow elastic, the outer layer in white inelastic fibres, and constituting a firm investment to all the other layers of which the artery is composed. The white inelastic fibres are shown in diagram N o. 3, fig. 5, with a yellow elastic fibre curling Â«, Yellow elastic fibres. 4, White inelastic fibres. c.

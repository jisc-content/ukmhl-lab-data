Compression of the brain means a diminution of the size of certain parts of it, resulting from the pressure of an ex- traneous body, whether it be fluid or solid, in consequence of which particular symptoms are generally known to ensue. When they occur, it is said that the sufferer is labouring under symptoms of compression of the brain, and apoplexy from the rupture of a bloodvessel may be considered as the best form or illustration of the complaint. These symptoms sometimes take place from the presence of a foreign substance, such as a point or piece of bone, which from the smallness of its size can hardly compress, although it may displace; and it is then said, that the symptoms arise from irritation of the brain. Many of them have also been found to occur from loss of blood, or the absence of pressure, or from insuificient pressure arising from changes in the circulation; and several different opinions have been entertained on all the points connected with these subjects. It has been argued, that as the brain is incompressible, no compression can take place. There is no proof, however, of the fact of its being incom- pressible as a whole, although it has been stoutly maintained by Monro secundus, Sir C. Bell, and others.

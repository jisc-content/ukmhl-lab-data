473 Operation. fleeted, the posterior spinal or long muscles, running in and filling up the groove or hollow of the side of the spine, will now be distinctly seen, composed chiefly of the sacro-lumbalis, and the longissimus dorsi muscles—sometimes called as a whole the erector spinm, or the sacrospinal muscle. This, which forms a thick mass over the beginning of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, is not to be divided or interfered with, beyond a very few at most, of its external fibres; the opening into the chest about to be made should begin at its external edge, and go through the external intercostal muscle, which is now exposed on a plane below it. The eleventh and twelfth ribs, unlike all those which pre- cede them, except the first, have only one surface of articula- tion with the corresponding vertebra, to which they are attached, instead of two facettes articulating, one with the body of the vertebra above, the other with that below. They form—particularly the twelfth—a more acute angle with the spine than the others, which gives to them their greater degree of obliquity; whilst the freedom of their cartilaginous extremities enables the twelfth particularly, to be depressed or separated by a moderate force from the rib above, to a greater extent than at any other part; by which means a foreign body of larger size may be removed from between them more readily than elsewhere. 349. Operation.—The eleventh and twelfth ribs having been distinctly traced, and the obliquity of their descent from the spine having been clearly made out, the patient ought, if possible, to be placed on a stool, with tbe upper part of the chest supported by a pillow on a table before him. An incision should then be made, over the intercostal space between these ribs, three inches long, and slightly curved tbrough the integuments down to the latissimus dorsi muscle; and as the mass of long spinal muscles is usually three inches in width, and can in general be seen, the incision should commence two inches from, but between the spinous processes of the eleventh and twelfth vertebra?, and be continued obliquely or diagonally downwards in the course of the interspace between these ribs. The latissimus dorsi and the serratus posticus inferior muscles having been divided at the upper part where s s 2

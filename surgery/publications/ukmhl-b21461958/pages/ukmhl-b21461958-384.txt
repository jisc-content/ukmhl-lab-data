The means which the improved methods of auscultation have afforded, cause the progress of the symptoms which follow to be less obscure, an lead to a less doubtful practice than formerly; whilst they render a knowledge of this branch of medical science an essential part of the education of a surgeon. 296 Incised or punctured wounds, from swords, lances, bayonets, or knives, require a treatment essentially distinct, on many points,from that of gun-shot wounds, especially m the com- mencement. On this early treatment so much depends, that details of the more serious or more important cases are rarely found among the records of injuries sustained on the field of battle, where so much is often to be done, and so few are to be found to do it. ...

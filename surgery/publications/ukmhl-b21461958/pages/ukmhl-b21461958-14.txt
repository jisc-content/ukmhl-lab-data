2 Every public functionary and one to the principal officer of the Honourable the East India Company's Service in each presidency in India. If the Court of Directors should consider this commentary worthy of the notice of the medical officers of their native regiments, they may obtain as many copies as they please from the printer, at the same charge as he will make to me for those I shall give away.

251 LECTURE XV. Ligature of the common iliac artery; of the aorta; of the internal iliac artery; of the external iliac artery—two methods; in cases of aneurism of the gluteal or sciatic artery, the internal iliac artery should be the vessel secured—in all cases of wounds, the wounded artery itself; ligature of the femoral artery in the groin; compression not to be made upon it when the opera- tion is done for aneurism; operation for popliteal aneurism; suppression of wine; constitutional irritation after these ope- rations; ligature of the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries; of the anterior tibial artery; of the plantar arteries. 218. The operation for placing a ligature on the aorta should not be done by makiDg an opening through the front of the abdomen, as has hitherto been proposed. It should in future be attempted and executed nearly in the same manner as the operation for placing a ligature on the common iliac, which has succeeded. The aorta bifurcates usually on the body of the fourth, or on the intervertebral substance between it and the fifth vertebra, although it may be higher or lower a fact which cannot be ascertained previously to the operation; the most usual place is nearly opposite to the margin of the umbilicus on the left side. It is about half an inch above this that the ligature should be placed on the aorta, if this opera- tion is ever done again, rather lower than higher, on account of the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery. As the aorta is to be reached by carrying the finger along the common iliac, the comparative situation of that vessel is next to be estimated. The length of the two common iliac arteries varies according to the stature of the patient, and the place at which the aorta bifurcates. The common iliacs again divide into

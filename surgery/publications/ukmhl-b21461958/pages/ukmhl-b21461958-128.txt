116 Primary Amputation of the Arm- to be apprehended in the more favourable cases is from in- flammation, and this will be rather diminished than increased by the operation; the danger of deferring which is manifest and certain, whilst the injury committed in the thorax or abdomen is not ascertained, and its effects may be ob- viated. If the termination should be unfavourable, it can only be a matter of regret for the sake of the individual, and not for the non-performance of a duty. If the cavity of the chest be laid open, or several ribs beaten in, or a stuffing of the lungs take place from a large ruptured blood-vessel, all of which circumstances are obvious, and cannot be mistaken, the operation would, in all probability, be useless. A haemor- rhage of short duration, or the expectoration of blood in moderate quantities, although a dangerous symptom, is not to be considered as depriving the patient of a reasonable chance for life, for it frequently follows blows from more common causes, from which many people recover. If the opera- tion be delayed to ascertain what injury may have been done to the chest, from the symptoms that will follow, the danger resulting from both will be increased; and even when it has been ascertained that there is but little mischief existing in the thorax, the operation can no longer be performed with the same propriety, in consequence of the inflammation which has supervened; and the patient will probably die, when he would have recovered under a more decided mode of treatment. 108. A round shot or flat piece of shell may strike the arm, after rebounding from the ground, or when nearly exhausted in force, without breaking the skin, or only slightly doing it, yet all the parts within may be so much injured as not to be able to recover themselves: the bone may be considerably broken or splintered, the muscles and nerves greatly contused. The injury may not, perhaps, be quite so extensive. The bone may be merely fractured, and yet the soft parts will often be so much destroyed as not to be able to carry on their usual actions. A ruptured bloodvessel may, with an apparently slight external wound of this nature, pour out its blood between the muscles, and inject the arm to nearly double its size, all of which are causes rendering an operation necessary, and re- quiring decision, for inflammation will, and mortification may,

Peculiar division and fracture of inner table. Principle in surgery on this point. "Trephine less dangerous at the first than at a later period. Fragments of bone injuring the brain to be removed. Operation dangerous; illustrative cases. Brain bears pressure best in young persons. Symptoms of concusdon are frequently accompanied by those of com- pression. Contre-coup. 262.

A large splinter of the inner table was driven more than an inch into the brain, and on its extraction the patient's senses and power of voluntary motion instantly returned. The part of the skull to which the trephine was applied, did not indicate externally any depression, although the external table came away in the hollow of the trephine, leaving the inner table behind."

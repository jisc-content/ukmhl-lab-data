434 Effusion into the Chest takes place and after the supervention of some serious inflammatory symptoms, he was forwarded to Lisbon, for embarkation for France, in a fair state of recovery. It was the successful results of these cases which led to the closure of all such wounds in the first instance, with the bope of preventing thereby the extension of inflammation to the whole sac of the pleura, which in many instances it suc- ceeds in doing; and thus that which was done from apparent necessity in the first instance, rather than scientifically adopted, became a rule of practice, which may be laid down as a principle to be followed in similar cases. When persons thus wounded are neglected, the wound remains open, and the cavity of the pleura passes into a state of suppuration, after all the symptoms of acute pleuritis or of pleuro-pneu- monia have taken place. 331. If the union of a large incised or other wound by the ad- hesive process does not take place, a bloody serous fluid oozes out from und/r the dressings, if the oppression of breathing should not lead to their removal; and the patient is relieved by the discharge, which after a time, as the case proceeds towards recovery, will become less in quantity and more purulent in quality. If the union of the divided parts should take place ex- ternally, and the general as well as local symptoms become more urgent, there can be little doubt of a collection of some kind having taken place, and then auscultation and per- cussion, if the latter can be borne, become of the greatest importance. From the moment the wound is closed the ear becomes the most important guide; the only one in fact to be depended upon as to what is going on within the chest. The case is one of pleuritis, perhaps of pleuro-pneumonia, and hence the reason that the symptoms and treatment of these com- plaints have been more fully noticed than might be con- sidered to appertain to the province of surgery. The effusion of a bloody serous fluid comes on, after a penetrating injury, from the third until the seventh or ninth day, by which time the cavity of the pleura may be filled; puncturing the chest between the sixth and seventh ribs at the point of elec- tion or reopening the wound should be early resorted to for its evacuation.

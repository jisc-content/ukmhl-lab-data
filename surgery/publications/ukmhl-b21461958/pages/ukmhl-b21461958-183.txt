Structure of A rimes. 171 separable into two: the epithelial, marked 1, and the fenes- trated, marked 2. The middle coat is also separated into two; the inner, or muscular, marked 3, and the outer, or elastic, marked 4. The outer coat is divisible also into two layers, the inner, marked 5, and the outer, marked 6; number 5 being composed more of elastic fibres; number 6 more of areolar fibres, by which tissue, in a less condensed state, the arteries of the extremities are attached to their sheaths. Such may be considered to be the general composition of a large artery, each particular structure remaining to be examined. 174. If a small portion of the inner coat of an artery be gently scraped with a knife, or if the inside of the cheek be treated in a similar manner, a little white soft substance is brought away on it, called epithelium, a name given to it by Ruysch, from the delicate layer of epidermis investing the female nipple, kiri, upon, 9n\y, a nipple. The epithelium of the human body is divided into three kinds by microscopists—the tesselated, pave- ment, or scaly; the cylindrical,or conical; and the spheroidal, or glandular. The tesselated, as it exists in arteries, is repre- sented in diagram No. l,in three different stages—in the young person, in middle age, and in the very old person; one stage gradually degenerating or changing into the other, at each different period of life. It is composed of one or more layers of nucleated cells, of a flat, oval, round, hexagonal, or polygonal form, and about of an inch in diameter; the nucleus in

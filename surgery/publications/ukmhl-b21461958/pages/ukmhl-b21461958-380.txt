370 Removal of Blood from (lie, Dura Mater. sary where the broken portions are deprived of their natural support and connexions, but as little should be taken away as possible. When the loss of sense and motion is accompa- nied by fracture, and continues to increase rather than to diminish, after the necessary and usual means have been adopted for its relief, a piece of bone should be removed; and if blood should be found in any quantity on the dura mater, it may be necessary to take away more bone to admit of its free discharge; for although the gradual pressure of the brain from within will tend to expel it, this object may not be attained in sufficient time, and the patient may be lost. The older surgeons in these cases were anxious to ascertain how far or to what extent the dura mater was separated from the skull, and they often removed large portions of bone ac- cordingly; although their practice should not be implicitly followed, repeated observation has shown that modern sur- geons have often fallen too much into the opposite extreme of doing nothing. When blood has been evacuated in this manner, the parts must pass from a state of inflammation into that of suppuration before the dura mater can agam adhere to the superincumbent bone, and care must be taken that the matter shall have a free discharge. If symptoms of fever, followed by those of commencing compression, should super- vene from the granulations arising from the dura mater filling up the opening and preventing its exit, they should be ex- cised- or if the matter should have gravitated in a direction which does not admit of its being discharged, the opening in the skull should be increased so as to remove the impediment, and thereby lessen the danger. A layer of blood is often extravasated very thinly over the whole surface of the brain, and cannot be removed, although it may be absorbed. It is on the other hand often collected in larger quantity on the basis of the cranium, whence it will not be absorbed and cannot be removed. It may be extrava- sated without reference to the part on which the blow has been received, constituting a case analogous to that of apoplexy, for the relief of which no surgical operation can avail; but when a blow has been undoubtedly received on a part of the skull, and any sign of mischief can be perceived on or in that part, the removal of the bone is permissible.

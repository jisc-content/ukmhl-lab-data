428 LECTURE XXIII. Simple injuries of (lie chest from sioord or knife ; wound to be closed by a continuous suture; to lie on the wounded side- Treatment of incised wounds of greater extent; to relieve the oppression in breathing; to suppress hcemorrhage; closure of the wound; secretion of fluid into the cavity. Conclusions, six in number. 325.

It might be supposed that a very slight wound of the lung would be followed by some expectoration of blood, but this does not always take place; and although its presence may be con- sidered demonstrative of the injury, its absence is no proof of the contrary; for a considerable injury from a stab or from a musket-ball may be inflicted, with scarcely any sign of blood in the matter expectorated. If the pleurse are in their natural state, a small quantity of air may enter the chest, but the opening will require to be direct, and tolerably large, before the lung will separate or shrink from the wall on this account; if adhesions should have been previously formed between the pleuroe preventing it, they will be for the advan- tage of the sufferer. In a simple incised wound, injuring the lung perhaps extensively, as supposed from the bleeding from the mouth, no examination by probes or other instruments need or ought

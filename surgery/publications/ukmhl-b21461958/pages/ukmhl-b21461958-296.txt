It may even be said that there is no one symptom which is presumed to demonstrate a particular lesion of the brain, which has not been shown to have taken place in another of a different kind. Examination after death has often proved the presence of a most serious injury, the existence of which bad not even been suspected; and death has often ensued immediately, or shortly after the most marked and alarming symptoms, without any adequate cause for the event being discovered on dissection. One man shall lose a considerable portion of his brain without its being productive at the moment of the slightest apparent functional inconvenience; whilst another shall fall, and shortly die without an effort at recovery, in spite of any treatment which may be bestowed upon him, after a very much slighter injury inflicted apparently on the same part.

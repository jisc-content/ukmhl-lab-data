Bronchophony. 387 into the larger bronchial tubes causing bronchial respiration, which is no longer a vesicular or crepitating, but a whiffing sound, like that caused by blowing forcibly through a quill, or as if little gusts of air were blown in or blown out. The voice betrays to the ear of the auscultator another sign; it descends into the pervious bronchi, and being conveyed to the ear through the solid lung, gives rise to that peculiarity of voice called bronchophony, a correct knowledge of which can only be acquired by repeated observation. When the inflammation of the lung is confined to a small and deeply-seated spot, auscultation may not at first reveal the evil; or it may possibly be overlooked, through the sound part of the lung becoming more active, and giving forth in consequence a stronger and more puerile breathing, which may mislead the listener. When the vesicular murmur cannot be heard, when the rlwnchus or crepitating rale or sound is not present, and bronchial respiration and bronchophony can only be distin- guished, the case is one of great anxiety and danger. The second stage of hepatization is passing into the third, or purulent infiltration, of which auscultation shows no further signs, although the matter secreted may be expectorated, in proof of what has taken place. Pus is thus formed, which is steadily maintained by some pathologists, not to be deposited in the form of abscess, but to be infiltrated throughout the parenchymatous substance of the lung, finding its way into larger bronchial tubes, or being poured out from some parts of their secreting surface; but the accuracy of this statement, as a rule, may be doubted, from some dissections having proved the reverse. 302. The effects of inflammation of the pleura are well marked; the first is to diminish, if not to annul, the secretion of the exhalation, or halitus, by which it is lubricated; so that its surfaces can no longer glide without noise upon each ether. The patient is often made aware of the difference by some uneasy internal sensation; the auscultator by a rubbing or creaking sound emitted as the inflamed pleura, no longer smooth and polished, rub against each other, and become covered by a thick, effused matter, although not actually

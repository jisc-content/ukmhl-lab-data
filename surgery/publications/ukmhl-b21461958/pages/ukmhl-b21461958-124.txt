De Beaufwfs Artificial Foot. 112 The advantage of the invention is, that whereas a common wooden pin only gives one point of support, and consequently the body is obliged to raise itself, so as to describe an arc, of which the end of the wooden pin is the centre, the curved foot acts like a series of levers, each successive point of it being a fulcrum. It may be compared to a portion of a wheel: the body of the patient is rolled forward, with scarcely any effort of his own, the support being continuous, and preventing the slightest liability to slip. It also lessens the shock of walking, as the foot begins to act before the whole weight of the body is thrown upon it.

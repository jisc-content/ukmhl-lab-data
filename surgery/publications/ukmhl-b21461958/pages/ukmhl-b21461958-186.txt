174 Middle or Fibrinous Coat composed of No. 2. The middle coat, as it was termed, forms by much the greatest part of the thickness of an artery, and, generally speaking, is of a more or less yellow colour. It appears fibrous to the naked eye, and can be peeled off not unfrequently in a series of circular layers; when examined microscopically, it is seen to be composed of two sets of fibres arranged in a circular direction. The inner layer is composed of muscular fibres, of the organic or involuntary kind. (See line, marked 3, on the circular diagram.) The outer layer is composed of elastic fibres, and marked line 4 on the same diagram. These con- joined layers form the muscular coat of Mr. Hunter, the fibrous or contractile coat of later anatomists, who denied its mus- cularity from the supposed absence of fibrine-an error fallen into from chemical science being unequal at that time to its discovery, or rather of its more elementary part, called protein, the principal constituent both of albumen and fibrine, which two are now found to differ from each other in the addition only of three per cent, of sulphur. Mulder says, in his " Animal andVegetableChemistry,"(PartII,p.307,)Â«Thecombinations of sulpho-phospho protein (fibrine and albumen) and of sulplio- protein casein, with acids, alkalies, and salts, are especially

INTRODUCTORY LECTURE. Gentlemen,—Among the many papers, lectures, and books I have printed and published on various subjects, tbere are six volumes, entitled " Records of the Surgery of the War in Portugal, Spain, France, and the Netherlands," and one memoir on "Hospital Gangrene"—in all seven,some of which have gone through four editions; and I am now called upon for another, which shall consolidate the seven into one or two thick books; to which I demur, not liking the trouble. I have been also requested to abridge myself into one volume, to which I cannot assent, as that will give me as much, if not more trouble; and the booksellers take care that, under any circumstances, there shall be little or no profit beyond what they call the honour of the thing. I have, however, accepted the offer of the Editor of The Lancet to publish as many lectures as I may find it convenient to give from time to time on these subjects, with permission to print from the letter- press prepared for his journal as many copies as I may think fit. These lectures, thus given, will be merely a commentary on what I have already written, containing such additional points as the progress of science may have rendered necessary, and such recommendations for future observance as the advancement of surgery during the last thirty years may seem to require. When completed, and they will be almost aphorismal, or expressed in the fewest possible number of words, I shall send one copy to the library of every regiment in her Majesty's service, one to each Naval hospital station, B

Amputation at the hip-joint; in- juries justifying the operation; case of Captain Flack; wound of the principal artery, with fracture of the femur, necessitates the operation; in malignant disease of the femur, the operation affords the only chance of success; amputation at the hip-joint not to be done when the bone can be sawn through immediately below the trochanter major, and there be sufficient flaps; mode of operating; prior ligature of the femoral artery by Baron Larrey ; not practised in the British army; directions for operating; Professor Langenbeck's mode; Mr. Brownrigg's; illustralioe engravings; amputation by the circular incisions- secondary amputation; number of vessels to be tied in primary and secondary operations; Mr. Luke's amputation of the thigh by the flap operation; protrusion of bone after the operation; exfoliation from badly sawing or splitting the bone, or unduly separating the periosteum. 65.

Art and science at that point cease to be useful. 66. At the commencement of the war in the Peninsula, all surgeons believed it to be impossible to compress in an effec- tive manner the artery of the thigh against the bone, as it

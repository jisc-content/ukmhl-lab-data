442 Statistics of Wounds of the Chest. Between the 12th of April and the 28th of June, thirty-five died, fourteen were discharged to duty, and fifty-seven were transferred to Bordeaux, to proceed to England, some to die, some to be pensioned, but few in all probability to return to the service; being an ultimate loss of nearly one-half, if the fifty-seven cases sent to England could be traced. M. Meniere, in giving an account of the wounded carried to the Hotel Dieu of Paris, in the three remarkable days of July, 1830, where every case was immediately taken care of, says forty cases were received into the hospital; of these, twenty died; he states the cases of ten more, seriously wounded, who recovered; and he gives the names of seven more, in six of which the cavity of the chest was not perforated; and alludes to three wounded by small swords, who recovered; the loss being thus one-half, even if the rest happily and perfectly recovered, which may be doubted; thus showing that with the ablest assistance the Hotel Dieu of Paris could afford the loss was one-half. After the battle of Waterloo, the loss was much greater; with the army on the Sutlej, the loss was deplorable, in consequence of the want of a sufficient number of medical officers and of meansâ€”a state of destitution to which I have drawn the attention of the Directors of the East India Com- pany in the strongest possible terms, but which they will not rectify; and which must some day become the subject of Par- liamentary discussion, and, I doubt not, of public reprobation. 336. "When a musket-ball fairly passes through the cavity of the chest, the orifice of entrance is round, depressed, dark- coloured, and more or less bloody in the first instance; the " orifice of exit is generally more of a rugged slit or tear than a hole. The alarm is great, and the powers of life are much depressed. The wounds may or may not bleed; the sufferer may spit up more or less blood; respiration may be difficult; countenance pale; extremities cold; pulse variable; symptoms dependent on particular constitutions, and circumstances con- nected with the extent of injury. It has been said that balls are apt to run round the body, coming out at a point opposite to that at which they entered, without penetrating the cavity of the chest; this, whenever it does take place, is a rare exception to a general rule, dependent

"When the periosteum covering the bone is bruised, or the bone is merely deprived of this membrane, it does not follow that the bone should die or exfoliate. In many instances the wound will gradually close up and heal, as if no such accident had happened. A blow or bruise on the head often gives rise to a swelling or tumour, from the rupture of the small vessels passing into the cellular membrane between the scalp and the pericranium; the tumour in these cases appears immediately after the receipt of the injury as a soft swelling, and is usually found to con- tain blood, which in most instances is removed by absorption in the course of from two to three weeks. In some cases in- flammation supervenes, and one part becomes tender and appears to point; into this a small incision should be made to allow the blood and matter to escape, when gentle compression should be resorted to, in order to induce the parts to unite. Swellings of this kind in new-born infants, occurring from pressure during delivery, may be readily mistaken for defi- ciencies of the occipital and parietal bones, if it were not for the absence of all motion, which under such circumstances would be communicated to them from the brain. The blood effused in the cellular membrane raises the border of the swelling, which becomes harder than the neighbouring parts h n

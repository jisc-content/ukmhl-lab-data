Removal of Fingers. 239 brachial artery, although, that even must be done as a last resource, if the bleeding should still continue. If it be asked why not do this in the first, rather than in the last instance, the answer is, that it has so often failed to prevent a renewal of the bleeding from both ends of a wounded artery in the hand, that complete dependence cannot be placed upon it, particularly if there should be a division high in the arm of the brachial into the radial and ulnar arteries. When, how- ever, the arteries leading to the wound have been secured, either by pressure or ligature, near to the part, and the bleeding returns by the collateral circulation, which in the hand is so free, the cutting off the supply of blood through the main trunk may, and often has, suppressed the hsemor- rhage, at all events for a sufficient time to enable the injured parts to recover themselves, provided the fore-arm is bent, and the person kept at rest in the most restricted manner, without which this operation will also in all probability fail. It is believed that in this case the collateral circulation has been maintained by the interosseal artery. 209. "When the obstacle to the application of pressure arises from the injured state of the metacarpal bone or bones, one or more should be removed, with the fingers if necessary, so as to expose a clear and new surface, on which the bleeding vessels may be seen and secured. In some cases, and particu- larly if there should be a hsemorrhagic tendency in the arte- rial system generally, as known from previous accidents, the first compress maybe wetted with ol. terebinth., or the dilute sulphuric acid, or the matico; and these remedies may be also administered internally. 210. The same principles apply to arteries wounded in the foot, the operations on which will be hereafter described.

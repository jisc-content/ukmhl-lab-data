548 Ball passed per Anum. Brussels, where my attention was particularly attracted to him, in consequence of his having passed the ball (a small rifle one) per anum, three days after his arrival, or the sixth from the receipt of the wound. The wound was healed by the end of August; and he felt so well that he marched to Paris, with other convalescents, to join his regiment. After some weeks he got drunk, and suffered from an attack of pain in the bowels, in the situation of the wound, re- quiring active treatment. On attempting one day to have a motion, he found, after many efforts, that something blocked up the anus, and on taking hold of and drawing it out, he found it was a portion of the waistband of his breeches, including a part of the button holeâ€”a fact verified by Staff- Surgeon Dease, who wrote to me an account of this peculiar case. After this the man recovered without further difficulty, although, as in all such cases, there was a herniary projection. He was afterwards subject to costiveness, to pain in the part after a copious meal, probably from the stretching of the adhesions formed between the intestine and the abdominal peritoneum, which at first inclined him to bend his body forwards to obtain relief. In all such cases, the extraneous substance having lodged, and mainly injured, in all probability, the vitality of the part which assists in the lodgment, the ball becomes covered with a layer of coagulable lymph or fibre, capable of retaining it in its new situation, whence it is gradually removed by ulceration, or by the sloughing of the injured parts into the cavity of the bowel; much in the same manner as an abscess in the liver is evacuated into the duodenum, or neighbouring intestine, to which it may become attached. It is always fortunate when the canal from the external wound is cut off by the deposition of lymph, as it expedites the cure, and renders the injury less formidable; but if this should not take place, the contents of the bowel are discharged through it for a greater or shorter length of time, until the canal between the parts gradually closes, and cicatrization takes place, in default of which an artificial anus may remain in addition to the natural one, the functions of the bowels generally being performed with more or less difficulty.

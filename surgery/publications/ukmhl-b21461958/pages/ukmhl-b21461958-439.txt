Patient to lie on the Wounded Side. 429 to be made as a general rule; but the wound should be imme- diately closed by sutures after the external parts have been sufficiently examined to satisfy the surgeon that no portion of the offending instrument has been broken off and sticking in the part. The advantages derived from the closure of punctured wounds of the chest in former times led to the practice of sucking them by the mouths of irregular practitioners, gene- rally the drum major of the regiment, when the patient was a soldier; and the consequences, although in some instances apparently miraculous, were in others quite as unfortunate. That bleeding may take place from the lung into the cavity of the chest is indisputable, but little or no blood will escape through a small wound; and its continuing to flow from such a wound will be a presumptive, if not a conclusive proof that some artery external to the pleura has been wounded. Sucking, under ordinary circumstances, of a small wound, unattended by bleeding, does good by attracting the natural fluids to the parts, and thus causing them to swell, so as to be placed in apposition in the most advantageous manner for their re-union. Punctured wounds of small size therefore may be sucked chirurgically, if any one be willing to do it; after which a bit of gold-beater's skin, or dry lint, is to be placed upon the wound, supported by a compress covered by adhesive plaster; these dressings should not be removed for several days. 326. The patient should lie on the wounded part, as a general rule, if he can conveniently bear it, not for the purpose of allowing any effused blood or fluid to flow out, unless some particular reason require the precaution of keeping the wound open; but to allow the pleura covering the lung to be as closely applied as may be to the pleura lining the wall of the chest, with the hope that the adhesive process may take place between these parts, and by this means cut off the wound from the general cavity of the pleura; a proceeding due to the practice of the Peninsular war, and not too well known at the present time to some teachers of surgery, who seem to confound the practice thus recommended in incised wounds penetrating the cavity of the chest with that which should be adopted in gunshot wounds. They ought not to

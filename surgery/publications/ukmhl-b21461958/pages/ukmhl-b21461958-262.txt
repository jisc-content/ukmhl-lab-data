252 Relative Situation of the Common Iliac Arteries. the external and internal iliacs, -which division is usually oppo- site to the sacro-iliac symphysis. The length of the common iliac artery is therefore tolerably well defined, as scarcely ever exceeding two inches and three quarters, and seldom being less than two inches. The external iliac is a little longer than the common iliac, and the place of subdivision of the common iliac into external and internal can always be ascertained during an operation, by tracing the external iliac iipwards to its junction with the internal to form the common trunk, which proceeds upwards and inwards to the aorta. The left margin of the umbilicus being taken as a point opposite to that which may be presumed to be the part at which the aorta divides, and the situation of the external iliac becoming femoral being clearly ascertained, a line drawn between the two will nearly indicate the course of these two vessels; sufficiently so at all events to enable the operator to mark with his eye or with ink the place where he expects to tie the artery, and to regulate the length of the incision, so that this ideal spot may correspond to its centre. It is necessary to recollect also, that the whole of one hand and part of the other must be introduced into the wound, to enable the operator to pass the ligature round the artery, and to tie the knots; so that an external excision of less extent than five inches will not suffice, and six will afford a facility in operating, which will save pain to the patient, and inconve- nience to the operator. In calculating the length of the inci- sion, allowance must be made for the size, obesity, and muscu- larity of the patient. If a rule be placed on the crest of each ilium, about one inch and a half behind the anterior superior spinous process, it will pass in a well-formed man across the junc- tion of the fifth lumbar vertebra with the upper part of the sacrum, and a little way behind where the common iliac divides into external and internal. The centre of an incision, six inches in length, beginning about half an inch above Poupart's ligament, and about the same distance to the outside of the inner ring, and carried upwards, will fall nearly on a line with this point. The incision should be nearly parallel to the course of the epigastric artery, but a little more to the outside, in order to avoid it and the spermatic cord, and

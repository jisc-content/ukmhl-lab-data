Amputation at the Ankle-joint. 101 tion necessary, the operation introduced by Mr. Syme for removing the foot at the ankle-joint, will be well adapted for this injury, provided the soft parts have not been so much destroyed as to prevent the formation of a covering flap or flaps. His directions are,â€” " Pressure should be made on the tibial arteries by the finger of an assistant, or a tourniquet applied above the ankle. The only instruments required are a knife, of which the blade should not exceed four inches in length, and a saw. The foot being held at a right angle to the leg, the point of the knife is introduced immediately below the malleolar projection of the fibula, rather nearer its posterior than anterior edge, and then carried straight across the bone to the inner side of the ankle, where it terminates at the point exactly opposite its commence- ment. The extremities of the incision thus formed are then joined by another passing in front of the joint.

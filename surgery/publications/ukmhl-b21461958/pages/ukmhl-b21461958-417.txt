Operation by Incision. 407 in which case even recourse should not be had to incision. When the arm is placed by the side, and bent forwards at a right angle, so that the hand rests on the ensiform cartilage, the inferior angle of the scapula will correspond in general^ but not always, with the interval between the seventh and' eighth ribs at the back part. The attachment, however, of the last of the true ribs, the seventh, to the xyphoid cartilage, can always be ascertained in front, and an error of importance cannot well take place, as the object in making a puncture by measurement is to avoid the diaphragm. Freteau, of Nantes, says that he performed the operation on the left side between the tenth and eleventh ribs, and on the right side between the ninth and tenth in more than thirty dead bodies, and always opened into the cavity of the chest, commencing the incision close to the edge of the latissimus dorsi muscle, or about three inches and a half from the spine, an operation which in this place should be done by incision, and not by the trocar. When there is reason to believe that there is an extraneous body to be extracted, such as a ball, the place of election is of importance, as it is desirable it should be a little above the diaphragm, in order to facilitate its extraction - for although, by carefully shifting the position of the patient, a ball or a piece of bone may be brought to rest against the opening, it will not be easily taken hold of, unless it lie upon the diaphragm, a point which will be hereafter further elucidated. When an external swelling indicates the presence of matter, and there is reason to believe it communicates with the inside of the chest, the opening should be made into the tumour, and is then called the " operation by necessity," which is not an uncommon occurrence after gun-shot wounds It is not always, however, done in the most convenient place' and should then be repeated lower down, which will also be sometimes necessary in consequence of the matter collected in this way being cut off by adhesions from the general cavity. When the operation by incision was alone performed the success was certainly not great. In modern practice (.after the operation by puncture) it has been much greater, which may be attributed to the operation having been had recourse

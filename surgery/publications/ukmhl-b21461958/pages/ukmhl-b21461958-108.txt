96 Amputation of the Leg. the same time as the tibia, by which the chance of splintering the fibula is diminished; for this bone is held much more steadily under the saw when the tibia is undivided, whatever pains may otherwise be taken by the assistants to secure it. The limb should be a little bent, and the circular incision made with the smaller amputating knife through the skin and integuments to the bone, on the fore part, and to the muscles on the outside and back part; and as the attachment of the skin to the bone will not readily allow of its retraction, it must be dissected back all round, and separated from the fascia, the division of which, in the first incision, would avail nothing, from its strong attachments to the parts beneath. The muscles are then to be cut through, nearly on a level with the first incision, and down to the bones. The inter-osseous ligament between the tibia and fibula is to be divided with the catlin; and as several of the muscles cannot retract, in consequence of their attachment to the bones, they are to be separated with the knife; and in the same manner, the inter-muscular septa or expansions running between them, are to be divided, as they will still prevent their retraction. The retractor with three slips is now to be put on, the centre slip running between the bones, by which the soft parts may be pulled back to a sufficient distance, any adhering part being divided by the point of the knife. The bones are to be sawn through with the usual precautions, and the retractor removed, when the three principal arteries should be secured: the anterior tibial, on the fore-part of the inter-osseous ligament, between the tibia and fibula; the peroneal artery behind the fibula; and the posterior tibial near it, more inwards and behind the tibia; this artery will frequently, however, contract very much, and will only show itself on the compression being taken off the artery above. It in general causes more trouble to secure it than the others, and I have two or three times seen, even in London hospitals, the needle dipped around it in despair, when merely pulling out the artery with the tenaculum, and dissecting a little round it, would have shown the small retracted bleeding vessels arising from it, and have prevented, in all probability, a secondary haemorrhage The tourniquet ,if uaed.being removed, the smaller vessels tied.and the stump sponged with cold water, and dried, the integuments and muscles should be brought

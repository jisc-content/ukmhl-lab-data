23 LECTURE II. A wound made by a musket-ball is essentially a contused wound; sometimes bleeds; attended by shock and alarm when from cannon-shot, or when vital parts are injured; secondary hemorrhage rare. Entrance and exit of balls. Course of balls. Position. Treatment: cold or iced water; no bandage to be applied; wax candles. Progress of inflammation.

A wound made by a musket-ball is essentially contused, and attended by more or less pain according to the sensibility of the sufferer, and the manner in which he may be engaged at the moment of injury. A musket-ball will often pass through a fleshy part, causing only the sensation of a sudden and severe, although sometimes of a trifling blow. If it merely strike the same part without rupturing the skin, the pain is often great. Major King, of the Fusiliers, was killed at New Orleans by a musket-ball, which struck him on the pit of the stomach, leaving only the mark of a contusion. 2. Wounds from a musket-ball do sometimes bleed consider- ably at the moment of injury, and for some little time after- wards, although no large vessel shall be injured to render the bleeding inconvenient or dangerous; and as a large artery is rarely injured by a musket-ball, the application of a tourniquet is seldom if ever necessary, unless a vessel of some magnitude should be torn or partially divided.

Conclusions. 440 vessel external to tlie cavity, that vessel must be secured by torsion or by a ligature applied on it, all the other methods recommended being simply surgical absurdities. d. If blood flow from within the chest, in a manner likely to endanger life, the wound should be instantly closed; but as the loss of a reasonable quantity of blood in such cases, say from two to three pounds, will be beneficial rather than otherwise, this closure may be delayed until syncope takes place, or until a further loss of blood appears unadvisable. e. If the wound in the chest have ceased to bleed, although a quantity of blood is manifestly effused into the cavity of the pleura, the wound may be left open, although lightly covered, for a few hours, if the effused or extravasated blood should seem likely to be evacuated from it, when aided by position; but as soon as this evacuation appears to have been effected, or cannot be accomplished, the wound should be closed. It must be borne in mind that the extravasation which does take place is usually less than is generally supposedâ€”a point which auscultation will in all probability disclose. f. If the cavity of the pleura is full of blood, and the oppression of breathing and the distress are so great as to place the life of the patient in immediate danger from suffoca- tion, the wound should be re-opened, if it have been closed, or freely enlarged, if small, to such extent as will allow of a clear evacuation of the effused blood. It has been supposed that in such a case the lung does not sufficiently collapse, and the bleeding is therefore continued because the vessel cannot contract; but the lung will collapse under pressure of the air, unless prevented by previously-formed adhesions, when the haemorrhage may possibly cease ; instances of which are said to have taken place; and the practice should therefore be borne in mind.

t Convulsions general or partial. 313 brain on the right side was so remarkable, when compared with those of the left, as to leave little doubt of its having been occasioned by something which had pressed them against the inside of the cranium; and on slicing off a portion of the brain, a larger coagulum of blood was found below than is usually observed to exist without the almost immediate death of the patient. The same thing has been so distinctly marked in other instances, that no doubt can be entertained of those convolutions of the brain which were situated between the coagulum and the cranium having undergone a considerable degree of compression. It is worthy of remark, that the pulse of this person was always regular and remarkably quick, from the first examination after the receipt of the injury until the period of his death. 256. Convulsive actions of the muscles, or positive convulsive fits, are always important symptoms; yet they seem in some persons to be dependent on idiosyncrasy, particularly when they appear early, and after the loss of blood, in which case they are less dangerous. They occur at different periods after the receipt of the injury, and have been supposed to depend in general upon laceration of the substance of the brain, although experiments on animals, would seem to show that they may be caused directly by irritation of the cerebro-spinal axis within the skull, in which case the patients are more likely to recover. They have been observed particularly on the side opposite to that which is paralytic, so as to give rise to the idea that the paralysis is dependent on injury of one side of the cerebrum, and convulsions of the other. When the effect of the injury is so great as to cause complete paralysis, convulsive twitches do not take place, although they frequently precede, and may in many cases be considered as premonitory signs' whilst the evil which gives rise to the paralysis is gradually accumulating. When the paralysis is not complete, the side so affected suffers sometimes from slight convulsive twitches whilst well-marked spasms prevail in the other, leading to the belief, that whilst paralysis is an affection of only one half the brain of the opposite side, or of half the spinal marrow of the same side, convulsions are the effect of a more general irritation, capable, however, of being con- E E

98 Amputation of the Leg. and dressing of the stump are accomplished as in the thigh amputation, but more care is required to avoid pressure on the acute margin of the tibia, (which, when very sharp, should be removed,) and to prevent the pendulous state of the flaps. A. The mid-point between B and C, at which the knife is in- troduced for carrying it across the limb. A to D. The course of the incision to form the posterior flap, E. F to g. The course of the incision to form the anterior flap. When the nature of the injury renders amputation neces- sary at or immediately below the tuberosity of the tibia, the operation may be done with safety. Baron Larreyrecommended the removal of the head of the fibula in such cases, which I have done with impunity, and made thereby a better stump than if it had not been done; but as the articulating surface of the head of the fibula does sometimes enter into the composi- tion of the knee-joint, and this cannot be known beforehand, the removal of this portion of the fibula is not advisable, neither must the tibia be sawn above the tuberosity, lest the capsular ligament be implicated. As an operation by which the knee- joint is saved, it is important, for although the stump is very short, it forms a solid support for the body, and enables the patient to walk without the aid of a stick, and admits of the adaptation of an artificial leg. The skin, in these cases, must be saved, in every direction, by flaps, to form a covering. When in sufficient quantity, the operation may be done by the circular incision, as much muscle as possible being saved, to aid in forming a covering on the under and outer sides. The posterior tibial artery will be found to have retracted behind the head of the bone, whence it, or others which may bleed, must be drawn out. The nerves must be cut as short as possible.

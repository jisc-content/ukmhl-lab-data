Cause of Mortification. 182 an artery such as the femoral, or the application of a ligature, thQ temperature of the limb is commonly diminished; after that period, and as the action of increase takes place, the tem- perature is'usually from three to five degrees higher than in the opposite healthy limb. At the end of from eighteen to twenty-eight days, in a successful case, it is found to be equal in both. It is asserted by some sanguine supporters of the all- powerful influence of the collateral circulation, that it is suffi- cient at all times, and under all natural circumstances, to maintain the life of the extremity. The practice of the Peninsular war proved the fallacy of this opinion in too many instances to admit of any doubt of its inadequacy to do so in the lower extremity after the division of the femoral artery, under ordinary circumstances. The fact of enlargement or of a new development of vessels having taken place after the commencement of disease, or the reception of an injury, has been demonstrated by dissection, and it is through them the life of the limb is to be preserved; but time is required for their development. When a limb is lost through mortifica- tion, as the consequence of a division or obstruction of the principal artery, it usually takes place after the infliction of a sudden injury, in consequence of these collateral branches not having had time to enlarge. 179. The collateral circulation is therefore not the same, and is not in the same stage of preparation, in a limb suffering from a divided or wounded artery, as in one in which an aneurism has for some time existed; and this is the reason why mortifi- cation is more common after wounded arteries than after operations for aneurism.

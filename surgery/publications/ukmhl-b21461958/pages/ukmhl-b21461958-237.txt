Amputation not always to follow Mortification. 227 amputate a thigh when mortification has stopped just below the knee, and a line of separation has been formed between the dead and the living partsâ€”an opinion formed on a principle laid down in opposition to those usually received by the pro- fession at large, and which have been entertained from the fact, that amputations done under these circumstances are commonly fatal. Richard Cook, aged fifty, a mason, whilst sitting on a square block of stone, on the 23rd of February, was struck by another, which drove the popliteal space, or ham, against the edge of the block on which he sat, giving him great pain, and otherwise greatly bruising the leg, although no bones were fractured, nor was the skin torn. The limb, on his admission, half an hour afterwards, into the Westminster Hospital, was much larger than the other, and of a dark reddish-blue colour, evidently from the bruise or extravasation of blood, which appeared to be still issuing from the vessel or vessels, as the limb continued to increase in size, until it became at last greatly swollen. The pulsation of neither the anterior nor the posterior tibial artery could be distinguished through the swelling the next morning. The bowels were opened, and a cold spirit lotion was applied to the calf and around the leg, and the swelling somewhat subsided, the limb becoming quite a blue-black, which, with the tenseness of the parts, distinctly indicated the effusion of a large quantity of blood. It was soon obvious that greater mischief had occurred than had been expected; and on the 2nd of March, as vesications, filled with a bloody fluid, were formed on the outside of the leg, over the fibula, and the whole limb was manifestly about to pass into a state of gangrene, if it had not already done so, I prepared everything for tying the popliteal, or other arteries, if found necessary, and made a long and deep incision on the outer and back part of the leg, through the integuments and muscles, posterior to the fibula, and removed a considerable quantity of coagulated blood from between the muscles and from a large cavity which extended upwards into the ham, without causing further haemorrhage, and in no part of which cavity could an artery be felt. The patient's countenance and body had assumed a jaundiced hue; the pulse was very quick; the

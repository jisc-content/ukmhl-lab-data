Suppuration on the Surface of the Dura Mater and Brain. 351 is incapable of maintaining its life, and must die. If the outer table only be diseased, it may exfoliate; but if there be reason to believe that matter has collected beneath, on the dura mater, the bone should be removed by the trephine. Inflammation of the dura mater proceeding to suppuration, or the formation of matter between it and the bone, appears to have been a much more common consequence of injuries of the head, in former times, than at present; it is not now of frequent occurrence in London hospitals. As blows on the head, and the structure and functions of the brain, are the same at present as formerly, the difference in regard to such cases can only depend on the difference of treatment. It is, in fact, infinitely more depletory now, and therefore less operative. Blood is taken away in larger quantities, and the tartrate of antimony and mercury are by most surgeons administered at an early period. Suppuration, or the formation of pus on the surface of the dura mater, not being, under the strictly antiphlogistic and mercurial system, so common as formerly, sufficient atten- tion has not perhaps been paid to another evil which frequently accompanied it in former timesâ€”viz., suppuration on the surface and in the substance of the brain itself; for the greater number of those who died with fracture and depression of the skull, and whose cases are recorded, suffered also from alteration of the structure or substance of the brain, and the formation of matter within it or upon its surface; this termination might not have taken place in a large proportion of the cases in which it occurred, if the depressed bone had been raised to its level, and the irritation arising from undue or unequal pressure had been avoided. It must be admitted, however, that an internal part of the brain may receive such shock at the moment of injury, as well as an external part, that no treatment can arrest the progress of the mischief, although it may be delayed; and when the patient dies, after four, five, or more weeks of alternate hope and suffering, matter may be found in some part of the brain where an injury was not suspected. Purulent matter may be formed beneath the dura mater

271 LECTURE XVI. Ligature of the common carotid artery: the external; the internal; the arteria innominata; the subclavian, the axillary, the brachial, the ulnar, the radial, and their terminations in the palm of the hand. 230. The carotid artery may be tied in almost any part of its course, in the following way:â€”The patient being seated with the shoulders supported, in such a manner that the light may fall on the neck, the head is to be bent a little forwards, to relax the muscles on the fore part. An incision is then to be made on the line of the inner edge of the sterno- cleido-mastoideus muscle, by which the integuments, the platysma myoides, and the superficial cervical fascia are to be divided. The extent of this incision, in persons with long necks, may be from a line beginning parallel with the cricoid cartilage to within about half an inch of the sternal end of the clavicle: when the neck is very short, it must be begun as high up as the lower edge of the thyroid cartilage, so as to be as nearly as possible three inches in length. The sterno-cleido- mastoideus muscle is then to be drawn outwards, with any vein which may be seen attached to its under edge. The pulsation of the artery under the fiDger will point out its situation, and the sterno-hyoideus and sterno-thyroideus muscles being drawn and kept inwards, the omo-hyoideus will be seen crossing in the upper part of the hollow thus formed by the separation of these parts. The central tendinous portion of this muscle is attached and fixed by the deep cervical fascia, and lies immediately over the sheath of the

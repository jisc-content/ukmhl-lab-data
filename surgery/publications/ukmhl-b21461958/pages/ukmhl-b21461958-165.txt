Tables of Hospital Returns. 153 Of 310 amputations, 25 died, 172 recovered in the field, and 113 were sent to the rear, of whom one-sixth may be con- sidered to have died, making a total of 45 deaths in 310 cases, the proportion of upper exti-emities to lower in the 310 being as 182 to 128, thus greatly influencing the result, which is con- sequently much more favourable than if the numbers had been reversed. The proportion of upper to lower extremities in the secondary operations, as by Return No. III., is equally in favour of the upper, and can only be accounted for, when compared with Return No. IV., by the army being constantly in motion, and the hospitals at a distance. The difference of results at the several stations is also remarkable; it is so with the divisions in the field. The 3rd and 4th divisions under staff-surgeons Lindsey and Boutflower, kept their amputations with them in bivouac, and their success is remarkable; that of the 4th division has no parallel. The light division, on out- post duty, could not keep their amputations. These two returns include 886 amputations. The labours of the surgeons of the army may be judged of by the fact, that during the last three months of the year, to which these returns refer â€” viz., from September 25th to December 24th, 1813, the number of sick and wounded amounted to 37,144, a number nearly equal to that of the whole army.

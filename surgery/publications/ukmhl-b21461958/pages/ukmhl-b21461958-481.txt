A natomy of the parts concerned. 471 open into the cavity of the abdomen,â€”a difference in result to be explained by reference to the anatomy and physiology of the parts concerned; showing that this operation, when required on man, should alway be done cautiously by incision, and not by puncture with the trocar and canula. On examining the lower part of the chest from within, after removing the pleura, the diaphragm is seen forming the boundary between the thorax and the abdomen, commencing from the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, and forming an arch under which the upper part of the psoas muscle passes (the ligamentum arcuatum proprium). From this part extends another aponeurotic arch along the lower border, to the end of the last rib, called the false liga- mentum arcuatum (ligament cintre du diaphragme of Cruveil- hier), which is nothing more than the upper edge of the anterior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, folded upon itself in all its extent. The diaphragm is after- wards attached to the lower border of the twelfth, and in succession to the eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, seventh, and sometimes to the sixth, ribs, counting from below upwards. The external intercostal muscles are distinctly seen between the ribs, extending from the spine until they meet and are concealed by the fibres of the internal intercostal muscles, near the angles of the ribs. The vessels and nerves, after passing on the external intercostal muscles, subsequently run between them and the internal ones. The lower intercostal arteries arise from the aorta on each side, and before they enter the space between the ribs, give off a branch passing backwards to the vertebral canal, and the posterior muscles of the spine. The eleventh and twelfth intercostal arteries, covered at first by the pillar of the diaphragm, ascend on leaving the vertebra to reach the under edges of the ribs, and are accompanied by a vein and nerve. The tenth intercostal artery, and those immediately above it, run almost horizontally, and nearly in the mid spaces of the ribs, as far as their angles, at which part a small artery is commonly given off, which descends from the main trunk at an acute angle to the rib below, and may be injured in opening into the chest, and be perhaps mistaken, in operating,

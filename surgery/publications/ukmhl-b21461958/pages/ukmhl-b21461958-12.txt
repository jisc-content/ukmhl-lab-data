PREFACE. vi n his subjects. Leave of absence for three months might be advantageously granted to officers in turns for the purpose of attending these lectures, and the Professor should certify as to their time having been well em- ployed. For thirty years I endeavoured to render this service to the Army, the Navy, and the East India Company, from the knowledge I had acquired of its importance. To the Officers of these services my Lec- tures and Demonstrations were always open gratui- tously, as a mark of the estimation in which I held them. By the end of that period the enthusiasm of the anthusiast who wished for another battle in 1814 had ^ozed out, like the courage of Bob Acres in "The Rivals," at the ends of his fingers. The course of instruction was discontinued, but not until such parts svere printed, under the title of "Records of the Surgery of the War," as were not before the public, in order that teachers of civil or systematic surgery should be acquainted with them. The reasons for the pub- lication of the following Commentaries are stated in the Introductory Lecture. 4, Berkeley Street, Berkeley Square, June 21, 1853.

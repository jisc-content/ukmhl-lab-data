Collateral Circulation. 180 referrible to the time of life in which the continuity and per- meability of the main trunk cease to exist, but to the nature of the disease or injury which has given rise to it. When an aneurismal limb has been injected, on which an operation has not been performed, the collateral vessels have all been found larger and more fully shown than on the opposite side, although not to the same extent as in cases of a similar nature in which the operation has been done. It is necessary that this enlargement of the collateral branches should take place at an early period, because in many cases of aneurism the artery beyond or below the tumour is obliterated long before any operation is performed. The main supply of blood has been already cut off from the extremity, and the operation adds very little to the derange- ment of the circulation which has for some time taken place below the tumour. "When an operation has been successfully performed for aneurism, and the patient has died some time afterwards, dis- section has shown various arteries enlarged, both above and below the part where the trunk was obliterated by the liga- ture; and not only an enlargement of arteries, which from their regularity have received names, but others have been developed not usually known to exist, or not of a size to be conveniently traced. These through their frequent anastomoses bring the blood at last into several larger trunks, by which it is again conveyed to the original vessel below all and every obstruction which may have taken place; thus compensating by a circuitous route for the loss of the direct supply. The principal object of inquiry is, do these vessels always exist, or at what period of time do they begin to enlage, so as to enable them to carry on the circulation, in the manner in which it is presumed to be done ?â€”for few will assert that the enlarge- ment of these particular collateral vessels was an accidental play of nature, and existed previously to the commencement of the disease or injury for which the operation was per- formed. On this point, the theory of the operation for aneu- rism and its applicability to wounded arteries appears to hinge; and what is of more importance, on which the practice resulting from it depends.

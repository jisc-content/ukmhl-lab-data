458 Case by General Macdonald. soldier, who knew that his chance of recovery was small. It was a most gallant, a most friendly spirit. Peace to his manes. If the ball had caused a greater degree of irritation, I was prepared to cut down upon the rib, and remove a part of it, if necessary; for I have seen balls so situated slip from their lodgment, roll on the diaphragm, and cause general inflam- mation, suppuration of the cavity, and death, which must almost always ensue in such cases, unless the ball can be removed, and the matter evacuated by an operation to be hereafter described. General Macdonald, of the Royal Artillery, was present at Buenos Ayres, when a bombardier of that corps received a wound from a two-pound shot, which went completely through the right side, so that when led up to the General, who was lying on the ground, he saw the light quite through him, and supposed he was of course lost. This however did not follow, and some months afterwards the man walked into General (then Captain) Macdonald's room, so far recovered from the injury, as to be then able to undertake several parts of his duty before he was invalided; thus proving the advantage of a shot, however large, going through, rather than remaining in the chest.

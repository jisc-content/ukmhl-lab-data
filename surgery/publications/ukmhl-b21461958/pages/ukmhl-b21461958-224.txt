214 Observations on the Precept. to the bottom of the -wound or the bleeding part. It is necessary in such cases to be attentive to the course of the great vessels and nerves, but not to the safety of muscular fibres, the division of which leads to no permanent injury. As pressure on the main trunk led to the ultimate suppression of the haemorrhage, it may be said, that a ligature placed high up on the femoral artery would not only have done the same, but would have relieved the man from the anxiety necessarily dependent on the momentary fear of a recurrence of the haemorrhage. There are two objections to this method of proceeding: the likelihood of mortification taking place, which in similar cases has been known to occur; and the possibility of the haemorrhage being renewed through the anastomosing branches. The temporary suspension of the circulation by pressure does little or no harm, more particu- larly where the pad used is so thick and narrow as to cause it to fall principally on the artery, and only in a slight degree on the surrounding parts, which by a little attention may be readily accomplished. It is not, then, good practice to cut down upon an artery on the first occurrence of hajmorrhage, unless it be so severe or so well marked as to leave no doubt of its being from the main trunk of the vessel itself; nor is it then advisable to do so, except the artery continue to bleed; for many a haemorrhage, supposed to have taken place from the main trunk of an artery, has been permanently stopped by a moderately continued pressure exercised in the course of the vessel, and sometimes on the bleeding part itself, particularly if the blood be of a dark colour, indicating that it comes from the lower end of the vessel. A painter could not have had a better subject for a picture illustrative of the miseries which follow a great battle, than some of the hospitals at Salamanca at one time presented. Conceive this poor man, late at night, in the midst of others, some more seriously injured than himself, calmly watching his bloodâ€”his life flowing away without hope of relief, one man holding a lighted candle in his hand, to look at it, and another a pewter washhand-basin to prevent its running over the floor, until life should be extinct. The unfortunate wretch next him with a broken thigh, tho ends lying nearly at right

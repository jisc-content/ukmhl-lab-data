231 Illustrative Cases. quantity of coagulated blood had forced itself under the soleus in the course of the muscles, increasing the size of the leg, and florid blood issued from both openings on taking the com- pression off the femoral artery. On passing the finger into the outer opening, and pressing it against the fibula, a sort of aneurismal tumour could be felt under it, and the lueniorrhage ceased, indicating that the peroneal artery was in all proba- bility the vessel wounded. In this case there was, in addition to the wound of the artery, a quantity of blood between the muscles, which in gun-shot wounds accompanied by inflammation is always a dangerous occurrence, as it terminates in profuse suppuration of the containing parts, and frequently in gangrene. Its evacuation therefore became an important consideration, even if the haemorrhage had ceased spontaneously. The leg having been condemned for amputation above the knee, the officers in charge were pleased to place the man at my disposal; and being laid on his face, with the calf of the leg uppermost, I made an incision about seven inches in length in the axis of the limb, taking the shot-hole nearly as a central point, and carried it by successive strokes through the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles down to the deep fascia, when I endeavoured to discover the bleeding artery; but this was more difficult than might be supposed, after such an open- ing had been made. The parts were not easily separated, from the inflammation that had taken place; and those in the imme- diate track of the ball were in the different stages from spha- celus to a state of health, as the ball in its course had produced its effect upon them, or their powers of life were equal or un- equal to the injury sustained. The sloughing matter mixed with coagulated blood readily yielded to the back of the knife, but was not easily dissected out. The spot which the arterial blood came from was dis- tinguished through it, but the artery could not be perceived, the swelling and the depth of the wound rendering any operation on it difficult. To obviate this inconvenience, I made a transverse incision outwards, from the shot-hole to the edge of the fibula, which enabled me to turn back two little flaps, and gave greater facility in the use of the instru-

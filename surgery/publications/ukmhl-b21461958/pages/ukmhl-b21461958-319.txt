Absence of Motion. 309 by the removal of the bone, unless some fluid be retained be- neath it. If the quantity of fluid extravasated or collected under it be large, it rises immediately on the removal of the bone; but the protrusion of this membrane does not always take place for some hours afterwards, if the fluid be more diffused. The motions of the brain, when the dura mater is thus protruded into the opening, become very indistinct, even if they can be perceived. These two pointsâ€”viz., the protrusion into the opening and the absence of pulsation, are important facts, to be borne in mind in connexion with the practice to be pursued. If we sometimes see the natural and ordinary size of the brain diminished under pressure, and that certain symptoms, such as insensibility, syncope, convulsions, and paralysis, are consequent on this state; and are relieved by the removal of the pressure and the restoration of the compressed brain* to its ordinary state; we may safely conclude that some derange- ment takes place in its integral parts, which may be best understood by the word Compression. If we further consider that compression can rarely exist without irritation, and that sometimes of a formidable nature, there does not appear to be so much difficulty in the subject as is frequently represented, although the physiological explanation may not be so simple. In the present state of our knowledge, we apprehend that in many cases approaching to apoplexy, in which the symptoms are similar to those arising from compression, all, or nearly all the vessels, as far as we can ascertain, are actually full of blood, instead of being partially empty and containing less than the natural quantity. When we see a patient, lying in a state of insensibility with a fracture of the cranium, imme- diately recover his senses after the application of the trephine and the removal of a large coagulum of blood, we are apt to suppose that the coagulum of blood and the insensibility stand in the relation to each other of cause and effect. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the pressure of the extravasated blood confined by the bone had occasioned the insensibility, and that this did not depend alone upon some few vessels containing less blood than usual; for the brain must be con- sidered as a whole in all these investigations, and reference

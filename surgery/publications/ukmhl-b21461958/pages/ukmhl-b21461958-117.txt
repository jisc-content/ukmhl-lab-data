Amputation at the Tarsus. 105 flap from the under part of the foot, is performed in the fol- lowing manner: The joints of the metatarsus with the tarsus having been well ascertained, an incision is to be made across the foot, in the direction of the joints, but from half to three- quarters of an inch nearer the toes, and the integuments drawn back over the tarsus. From the extremities of this incision, two others are to be made along the sides of the great and little toe, for about two inches and a half, according to the thick- ness of the foot; and the ends of these two incisions are to be united by a transverse one down to the bone, on the sole of the foot, the corners being rounded off. The flap thus formed on the under part is to be dissected back from the metatarsal bones, in- cluding as much of the muscular parts as possible, as far as the under part of the joints of the tarsus. The metatarsal bones are now to be removed by cutting into and dislocating each joint from the side, commencing on the outside, by placing the edge of the knife immediately above, but close to the projec- tion made by the posterior part of the metatarsal bone sup- porting the little toe, which prominence is always readily perceived. The arteries are to be secured, any long tendons and loose capsular ligament to be removed with the knife or scissors, and the under flap, formed from the sole of the foot, is to be raised up so as to make a neat stump, -when brought in contact with the upper portion of integuments that were first turned back; the whole to be retained in this posi- tion by sutures, adhesive plaster, and bandage. When the skin of the under part of the foot is much torn, which is not uncommon in a wound made by a fragment of a shell, the flap cannot be formed from it; in this case it must in great measure be saved from the upper part; but the integuments being here so much thinner, the flap is not so good a defence against external violence, and will be more readily affected by cold. The metatarsal bones may be sawn across in a straight line, in preference to removing them at the joint; and although the whole may be sawn across at once with more ease than any one of them individually, except the outer ones, yet the stump is never so much protected from external violence as when the operation is performed at the joints of the tarsus. 98. Amputation of the foot, leaving the astragalus and calcis, may, in certain cases of injury anterior to these bones, be per-

222 Errors demonstrated. the femoral artery, but the practice of the Peninsular ■war dissipated such fears. The reason given for not laying open the wound and looking at the bleeding artery in this case, is ingenious, but not tenable. The patient is said to have lost a quantity of blood; and if this were even a fact, which may however be doubted, is there a case on record of a serious wound of the femoral artery, such as this was supposed to have been, in which that vessel has been successfully secured by ligature, without the patient having equally lost so large a quantity of blood as to be supposed to be about to die? It has always been so; the reason is not therefore valid, and cannot be admitted. The fifth error arose from imagining that the considerable loss of blood supposed to have taken place would have ren- dered the patient incapable of bearing more; for it is a recorded fact, that those operations high up on the femoral artery, from which patients have recovered, have never been done without great losses of blood having been previously sustained; and if the patient was so weakened that his heart and arteries could not bear the abstraction from their contents of a few ounces more blood—supposing such loss to be inevitable—how could they have power to drive or force the blood through the limb by the collateral channels in a manner sufficient to support its life, when the main trunk was cut off within the pelvis ? They could not do it—they have rarely done it under such cir- cumstances; they could not have done it in this case; and if the patient had not died within the first forty hours of in- flammation of the peritonseum, to which accident he ought not to have been exposed, he would have died of mortification within forty hours more, which had already commenced, as shown by the swelling of the limb and pain in the calf of the leg, which almost invariably attend such mortification. The sixth error consisted in the belief, that if the femoral artery had been wounded, a ligature on the external iliac would have permanently arrested the bleeding. It would in all probability have done no such thing, beyond a day or two —perhaps even only for the moment. It is a delusion, per- sisted in notwithstanding the most clear and positive proofs to

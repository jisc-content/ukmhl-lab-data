507 Mticous Membrane of the Stomach. venous trunks. The vesicles, quite distended, and grouped in masses, push forward the membrane, and give to it, by these inequalities, an appearance resembling that of a mulberry. The minute vesicles above noticed fulfil the important office of absorption, by drawing into their cavities through their walls, by a process called endosmosis, that portion of the chyme necessary to form chyle; when filled with it they burst or dissolve, their contents being thus discharged into the texture or substance of the villus, fit to be taken up by the granular vesicles interspersed among the terminal loops of the lacteals and communicating with their trunks, running up from the root of the villus in their centre. Absorption is thus shown to be effected by closed vesicles, and not by vessels opening on the surface of the villus. The debris, and the contents of the dissolved chyle-cells, &c, pass into the looped net-work of lacteals, as in other lymphatics. When the gut contains no more chyme, the flow of blood to the mucous membrane diminishes, the develop- ment of new vesicles ceases, the lacteals empty themselves, the villi become flaccid, and the cast-off epithelium is repro- duced, apparently from the nuclei in the basement membrane, in the intervals of digestion, showing that this function should only be induced at regular periods, the presumed special use of the epithelium being to prevent, in a measure, the absorp- tion of any effete or other matters which might exert a dele- terious influence on the system, the epithelium of the follicles now secreting a mucus which may be considered protective. In the large intestines there are no villi, but the whole surface is covered with follicles, which must be capable of absorbing as well as of secreting, as it is ascertained that persons can be nourished and kept alive for many weeks by nutritious enemata which do not pass into the small intes- tines. 374. On examining the mucous membrane of the stomach, its follicular structure is immediately seen, the follicles re- sembling much in appearance those of the intestine; but in the stomach minute tubes are found opening into the bottom of each follicle, fulfilling in all probability, a different office, the follicles being lined by columnar epithelium, the tubes by

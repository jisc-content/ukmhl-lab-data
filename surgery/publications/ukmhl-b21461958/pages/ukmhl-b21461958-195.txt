183 LECTURE XL Proper treatment of wounded arteries due to the Peninsular war ; Hunterian theory inapplicable; opposing theory of Mr. GxUhrie; means supposed to be adopted by nature for the suppression of bleeding from large arteries from the time of Celsus to 1811 dis- puted ; their true nature shown; important distinction ch'awn between the processes adopted with upper and lower ends of a divided artery; cases illustrative of the facts stated; application of a small ligature; consequent processes; opmions formerly entertained, erroneous; internal coagulum not absolutely neces- sary; artery does not always contract up to its next collateral branch, nor is it necessavry; important case in proof; ligatures should, be small, roimd, and strong; undue interference to be avoided. 180. The due appreciation of the means adopted by nature and by art for the suppression of haemorrhage, as well as the proper treatment of wounded arteries, is owing to the surgery of the war in the Peninsula. They were suspected after the battles of Rolica, Vimiera, Oporto, and Talavera, but did not receive their complete development until the battle of Albu- hera. It was not until after that of Toulouse they were par- tially admitted; and it is only of late that they have been almost everywhere acknowledged, taught, and practised. Previously to the time of Mr. Hunter, the diseased or di- lated state of the coats of an artery which constitutes an aneurism, was, when it occurred in the ham, very often fatal. The operation of Anel, first performed in 1710, of cutting down to the artery, and placing a ligature upon it immediately above the dilated part, was not approved, and Mr. Pott, the great contemporary of Mr. Hunter, recommended that

He was sent to the rear at the end of ten weeks, nearly well. On the day preceding the battle of Fuentes d'Onor, in 1811, Serjeant Barry was wounded in the chest. The ball entered close to the nipple of the left breast, and passed out at the back, between the eighth and ninth ribs. The anterior opening of the wound soon healed, but the posterior one did not do so for a considerable period, when he became affected by such severe cough, with expectoration, that his medical attendant deemed it proper to reopen it. The symptoms were relieved, and portions of his shirt and jacket were discharged. After this his health improved so rapidly as to enable him soon to join his corps. The wound in the back repeatedly opened and healedâ€”generally at intervals of twelve or four- teen months; but for five or six years it ceased to do so.

He died of mortification of the left leg, Jan. 4th, 1833.

After many severe symptoms and much suffering, he died on the 1st of December, worn out by the discharge, which often amounted to a pint a day, and for the free exit of which the external wound had been early enlarged.

Ligature of the Anterior Tibial Artery. 270 having the tendons of the extensor digitorum communis on the outside, and that of the extensor proprius pollicis on the inside, by which it is overlapped, it being also covered by the fascia and the integuments. On the instep this artery runs over the astragalus, the naviculare, and the os cuneiforme internum, to the base of the metacarpal bone supporting the great toe. It here divides into two branches; one dips down between the first and second metatarsal bones, to join the terminating branch of the ex- ternal plantar artery, rendering the collateral circulation free; the other passes on to the inside of the great, and the opposite sides of the first and second toes. The artery is always to be found on the fibular side of the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis.

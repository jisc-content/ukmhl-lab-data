238 Treatment by Compression. fascia, (as extensively as the situation of the tendons and nerves in the hand will permit,) and which are best effected by introducing a bent director under it, the current of blood, through either the ulnar or the radial artery at the wrist, or even both, should be arrested in turn by pressure, which in most cases of this kind will succeed, if properly applied, and thus show the vessel injured. The bleeding point should be fully exposed, and all coagula removed, when a piece of lint , rolled tight and hard, but of a size only sufficient to cover the bleed- ing point, should be laid upon it. A second and larger hard piece should then be placed over it; and so on, until the compresses rise so much above the level of the wound as to allow the pressure to be continued and retained on the proper spot, without including the neighbouring parts. A piece of linen, kept constantly wet and cold, should be applied over the sides of the wound, which should not be closed, so as to allow of any blood being freely evacuated; and if the back of the hand be then laid on a padded splint, broader than the hand, a narrow roller may be so applied as to retain the com- presses in their proper situation, without making compression on or impeding the swelling of the adjacent parts, the fingers being bent, in order to relax the palmar aponeurosisâ€”a pro- ceeding which should never be neglected in any operation in the palm of the hand. It has been lately proposed by M. Thierry, a French surgeon, to raise and bend the arm, as a means of impeding the circulation where the artery passes over the elbow-joint, and the proposal deserves adoption, but not to the extent he recommends, which cannot be long sub- mitted to. Pressure made at the same time on the radial or ulnar arteries, or on both, by a piece of hard wood, two inches long, and shaped like a flattened pencil, is much more effec- tual, and more to be depended upon. When from the bones being broken, or the hand so swollen, or from other circum- stances, pressure, however lightly and carefully applied, cannot be borne in the manner directed; and the attempts to secure the artery at the bleeding spot have failed, and pressure on the radial or ulnar artery has been equally unsuccessful, in con- sequence of the swelling, or other circumstances; both maybe tied at the wrist, in preference to placiug a ligature on the

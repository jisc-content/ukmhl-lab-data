172 Efntlidial Goat, each cell containing within itself one or more nucleoli, and even several paler granules. The epithelium has a thickness proportioned to the friction or pressure to which it is exposed, particularly when covering the skin. In the arteries of the young, and in the mammalia generally, the epithelium is strongly marked; in older persons all traces hoth of cells and nuclei have disappeared. It lines not only the internal sur- face of the arteries and veins, hut the mouth with its cutaneous glands; the conjunctiva of the eye; the pharynx and oeso- phagus; the vagina and cervix uteri; the entrance of the female urethra, and the serous membranes. No. 1. MIDDLE. YOBNO.

It lines the urethra in the female, from the entrance where the tesselated ends, and extends inwards to the urinary tubules of the kidneys; the greater part of the male organs in a similar manner; the digestive canal and gland ducts, from the cardia to the anus.

Recovery after Wounds of the Heart. 487 friction, or attrition sound, indicating the presence of inflam- mation of the pericardium, may be absent, and will not be discernible, if a layer of blood be effused into the cavity of that membrane, whilst the natural sounds of the heart are rendered more indistinct as the heart is separated from the walls of the chest by the effusion, which distends the peri- cardium, and impedes the regular action of the heart, but cannot compress it, as an empyema does the lung. If inflam- mation take place without an effusion of blood, the friction sound will be heard, and will usually continue even after some effusion of serum and of lymph has occurred, as the quantity of serum is rarely sufficient to prevent the effused and attached portions of lymph from rolling against each other. The presence of a larger quantity of fluid may be more distinctly known by percussion, if it can be borne in cases of injury, the degree and extent of the dulness being the measure of its existence and accumulation. It may extend over a part or over the whole of the precordial region, reaching as high as the second, or even the first rib, beneath the sternum, and even under the cartilage of the ribs of the right side. 358. That the heart when wounded is capable of recovery by the permanent closure of the wound, in a few rare instances, is indisputable; and it would seem, from a consideration of the different cases which have been recorded, that such re- covery takes place in consequence of there being little blood discharged through the wound, or into the cavity of the peri- cardium, or into that of the pleura. The absence, or the cessation of haemorrhage, by the contraction of the wound or the formation of a coagulum, is the first step towards a cure and it was to one or other of these circumstances that most of those who survived the injury for several days or weeks owed their existence for the time, although they usually died from the effects of inflammation, more of the inner lining and outer covering, than of the substance of the heart itself. If the wound be inflicted by a musket or pistol-ball, it cannot be closed, although pressure may be made upon it for a time, so as to suppress the external flow of blood. If this should succeed, it is more than probable that the hasmor-

472 A natomy of the parts concerned. for the intercostal artery itself. From the angles each artery runs in a groove in the under edge of the rib as far as the anterior third, when they all become very much diminished in size, and, leaving the grooves, run in the middle of the intercostal spaces, until lost in their different anastomoses with the branches of the epigastric, phrenic, lumbar, and cir- cumflex iliac arteries. In making an opening into the chest between the tenth and eleventh, or between the eleventh and twelfth ribs, the artery will not be iujured, provided the opening be made below the middle of the intercostal space, which is wider between the eleventh and twelfth ribs than between those above it. The vein is situated above the artery, and proceeds to the vena azygos major on the right, and to the smaller azygos vein on the left side. The intercostal nerves are the anterior branches of the dorsal nerves, and lie below the arteries under the pleura upon the external intercostal muscles, until they approach the angles of the ribs, where they enter between the layers of the intercostal muscles. It is worthy of observation that the pleura is necessarily continued over the inside of the twelfth rib, to line the differ- ent attachments of the diaphragm, and that an incision may always be made into the chest above this point, if done care- fully. On removing the integuments of the back, covering the muscles and the lower ribs, the broad expanse of the latissimus dorsi muscle is brought into view, extending from the ilium and spine upwards and outwards, and covering all the parts of importance beneath, in the operation to be described. On the removal of the lower part of this muscle, the serratus pos- ticus inferior is seen, of a somewhat quadrilateral form, arising by a thin aponeurosis, common to it and to the latissimus dorsi, from the spinous processes of the three superior lumbar vertebne and the two inferior dorsal, and proceeding upwards and outwards to be inserted, by four flat tendinous digita- tions, into the four lower ribs. If this muscle be separated from its origins and turned out- wards, or divided in the middle, and its two portions re-

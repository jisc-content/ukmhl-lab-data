Peculiar illustrative Cases. 195 an inch, having within it a small coagulum. The lower end of the artery from which the hasmorrhage had taken place was marked by a spot of a similar character; but on passing a probe upwards from the popliteal space, it came out at a very small hole in the extremity of the artery, in the centre of the yellow spot, the canal of the artery not being contracted and diminished, but only apparently closed by a layer of the yellowish-green matter laid over it, and adhering to its cir- cumference. Serjeant Baptiste Pontheit, of the French 64th Regiment, was wounded by a musket-ball at the battle of Albuhera, on the upper and fore part of the thigh, which passed out behind, in the direction of the femoral artery. He lost a great quantity of blood at the time, but the wound went on well until the 26th, ten days after the battle, when he felt something give way in his thigh, and found himself bleeding from the wound, which, however, soon ceased on pressing his hand upon it. In the afternoon, on again moving, he lost about half a pint of florid blood, which induced the surgeon on duty to place a tourniquet on the limb. "When at leisure, (in the course of two hours,) I removed the tourniquet, and as no haemorrhage occurred, and there was no swelling in the vicinity of the wound, I replaced the dressing with a precautionary screw tourniquet, explaining to him its use, and the probable nature of his wound, together with the operation requisite to be per- formed in case of further bleeding. On turning at night, he lost a little more blood, which ceased by his tightening the tourniquet, which was shortly after loosened. In the morning, everything being removed, there appeared some swelling about the wound, the opening of which was filled up by a coagulum: gentle pressure being made, it readily turned out, and was followed by a stream of arterial blood, leaving little doubt of the femoral artery being wounded. Compression being effected in the groin, I made an incision three inches and a half in length, taking the wound as a central point, and exposed the femoral artery and vein: both were wounded, the former being half destroyed in its circumference, surrounded with coagulated blood, and appearing as if it had sloughed from being touched by the ball, the course of which

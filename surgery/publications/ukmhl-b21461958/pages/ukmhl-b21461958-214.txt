Secondary Hemorrhage. 204 stances which do not readily yield under irritation, such as the extremity of a nerve, or a slip of ligament which is not sufficiently compressed in the noose of the ligature. Secondary haemorrhage may also take place from the ex- tension of ulceration or sloughing to the artery from the surrounding parts, and perhaps as frequently as from any- other cause; but when mortification occurs, there is no secondary haemorrhage, unless in that species which is called hospital gangrene. The advantages to be derived from the application of a strong, small ligature, from the least possible disturbance of the surrounding parts, and from absolute quietude, whilst the healing processes are going on, must be so obvious as to require no further observation. An undue interference with the ligature, by pulling at it, cannot be too earnestly deprecated at an early period.

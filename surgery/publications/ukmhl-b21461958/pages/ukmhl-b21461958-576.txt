In many instances fistulous openings remain for years. The orifices of entrance and of exit of the ball lead to little in- formation. It is only from the absence of paralysis, or of hEemorrhage, or of those signs which indicate the lesion of any of the organs contained within the pelvis, that the surgeon can form an estimate of the evil which has been committed; even when parts of the greatest importance are injured, such as the bladder or the rectum, the general symptoms are oc- casionally of little moment. When paralysis occurs, which it rarely does unless the spinal marrow be injured, the functions of the bladder and of the rectum are implicated, and there is but little pain. When the nerves only are injured, the paralysis is not complete; it usually affects one side more than the other, is a numbness rather than a paralysis, and is accompanied by severe pain,

The ball had gone' through the chest from before, directly backwards; the pos- terior wound was closed; the anterior one was fistulous, and discharged a small quantity of matter, of which he spat up daily a large quantity until he died. The lung was diseased throughout, and contained several vomicae or small abscesses from which the matter expectorated was secreted. The' track of the ball was nearly filled up, although the part im- mediately around was harder than usual. The lung adhered in many places to the wall of the chest, which was much flattened. In other cases, portions of wadding, of leather belts of splinters of different lengths, pieces of buttons, and even balls, have been found loose in the chest, showing the necessity for an especial and decided treatment. A French soldier was wounded by a musket-ball at the battle of Waterloo; it penetrated the chest, fracturing the

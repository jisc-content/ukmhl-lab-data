250 Dr. Keith's Case of Ligature of tlie Internal Carotid. turned towards the right shoulder, when an incision was made from below the ear along the ramus of the lower jaw to below its angle. No haemorrhage occurred, and the vessel was speedily exposed, and secured by a double ligature passed under it, with less difficulty than the depth of the vessel would lead one to expect. One ligature arrested the flow of blood, and the other was therefore withdrawn. The woman recovered, without any return of the bleeding. Dr. Keith, aware of the necessity for tying the other end of the artery, if it should bleed, watched the case day and night until the period of danger had passed away. The pin gave no trouble, until felt by the patient as about to go down the oesophagus, which it did to her great satisfaction and relief from further anxiety.

Treatment in extreme Cases. 427 ation, the distress in breathing is removed, the failing circu- lation is restored, and the opposite lung resumes its functions. The course then to pursue in such extreme cases is, to punc- ture the chest, evacuate the air, withdraw the canula, and close the opening. The life of the patient having been thus saved, time is given for the wound in the lung to heal under the usual inflammatory processes, provided it will do so with- out a recurrence of the mischief. This, if it should take place, must be met by another puncture, or the opening in the chest should be made permanent, in order to equalise the pressure of the air in the cavity. The incisions (" the tailladea of the French") into the cavity of the chest, formerly recommended, should only be resorted to when the means indicated have failed, which they will rarely do, when combined in the first instance with an antiphlogistic treatment, aided by sedatives, and if necessary by cordials. The advantages to be derived from auscultation in these cases are evident. Their value has been sufficiently shown and the ear or the stethoscope should be resorted to at least three times in twenty-four hours, in every case, however trifling it may appear to be.

259 Ligature of the External Iliac Artery. now to be torn through with the nail, immediately over the pulsating artery, and the peritoneum is to be separated by the finger, and pushed upwards until sufficient room has been obtained; which, in this as well as in all other operations on the iliac arteries, is sometimes difficult on account of the pro- trusion of the intestines covered by the peritoneum, when the patient is not sufficiently tranquil. The artery is yet at some depth; it is covered by a dense cellular membrane, con- necting it to the vein on its inside, which must be torn through with the nail. The anterior crural nerve is separated from the artery by the psoas muscle, at the outer edge of which it lies. The aneurismal needle should be passed between the vein and the artery, and the point made to appear on the outside of the latter. In this operation the ligature is placed on the external iliac, above where it gives off the epigastric and the circumflexa ilii arteries; as the operation is very much the same as that already described, with the exception of the incision being shorter and nearer to Poupart's ligament, it is obvious, if it were found necessary from disease to tie the artery higher up, or even to tie the common iliac, that it might be done by merely enlarging the wound. It is therefore the best mode of proceeding when the aneurismal swelling in the groin has encroached on Poupart's ligament. Another method has been recommended by Sir Astley Cooper, which is perhaps more followed, where there is little doubt of the artery being sound. " The patient being placed in the recumbent posture, on a table of convenient height, the incision is to be begun within an inch of the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and is to be extended downwards in a semicircular direction to the upper edge of Poupart's ligament. This incision exposes the tendon of the external oblique muscle: in the same direction the above tendon is to be cut through, and the lower edges of the internal oblique and transversalis abdominis muscles are exposed; the centre of these muscles is then to be raised from Poupart's ligament; the opening by which the spermatic cord quits the abdomen is thus exposed, and the finger passed through this space is directly applied upon the

Treatment to be followed. 437 p p 2 for the evacuation of the effused hlood and serum. It is pro- bable that the wound of the vessel in the lung which furnished the blood will be closed in five or six days; whilst it is of great importance that the lung should be early relieved from pressure, that it should be allowed to expand, and not be bound down by false membranes, which will be the case if the com- pressing fluid be not removed, and the inflammatory symptoms subdued. There is no object to be gained but the suppression of the hsemorrhage by retaining the blood and serum within the chest; whilst the probability of a return of the bleeding is not great after an opening has been made, although much mischief will inevitably follow the effused fluids remaining too long. Repeated observation has shown that in sabre wounds pene- trating the chest and lung, which have not united, and from which no excessive hemorrhage has occurred, a great dis- charge of serous fluid usually takes place from the cavity, which, gradually diminishing, becomes purulent, and at last ceases, without the function of the lung being destroyed; whilst, if the wound had been early closed, and the fluid col- lected too long retained, the function of the lung would be impaired, and a counter opening, for the relief of the resulting empyema, may be unavailing. Whenever, therefore, the ad- hesive process between the pleurse has failed, and great effusion has taken place, the sooner it is discharged the better. In addition to the closure of the wound, it is desirable to arrest the haemorrhage by other means, if possible, such as the abstraction of blood from the arm, to such an extent as it may be considered the patient can bear; the administration of the acetate of lead with opium, turpentine, matico, or the mineral acids; and the external use of cold or iced water, if it can be borne. If there be reason to believe that a rib or ribs have been injured,—that any extraneous body is enclosed in the wound,—or, from its appearance, that it will certainly re-open—an incision should be made in the part injured, for the purpose of giving the necessary assistance. The cure, however, will not only be assisted, but mainly effected, by procuring a depending opening, by means of the small trocar and canula introduced as low down as auscultation will au-

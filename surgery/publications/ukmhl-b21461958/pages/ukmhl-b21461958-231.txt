Errors demonstrated. 221 ever name it may be called, having two openings leading to, or into it, and communicating with the atmosphere, could be augmented to any dangerous extent by the further pouring out of blood from an artery of any size, or from any artery at all, without some of such extravasated blood being discharged, or forced out through one or both of the open external wounds in sufficient quantity to show that the opening in the vessel was not closed. The first two errors, or defects of principles, gave rise to the third—viz., the belief that an operation was necessary where none was required, the dissection having proved that the whole idea of the nature of the injury was a mistake: there was no large artery wounded; the small one, which had been wounded, had ceased to bleed; the quantity of blood extrava- sated did not exceed seven small table-spoonfuls. The third mistake could not have taken place if the first two errors had not been committed. The fourth error occurred from its being taken for granted that the femoral artery was wounded, and that ascertaining the fact by opening the small swelling which contained only three and a half ounces of blood, would be followed by a fatal haemorrhage; which supposition arose from this swelling re- ceiving a pulsatory motion from its vicinity to the femoral artery,—a mistake which should not have occurred; for it had long before been said, (page 16 of my published lectures,) " The motion or pulsation of the swelling often depends on the impulse given to the whole as a mass, by the great artery against which it is lying, and not upon blood circulating through it. When blood is extravasated by the rupture of small vessels in consequence of the passage of a wheel over the limb,—and especially in the thigh, where I have seen a swelling containing fluid blood pulsate in an almost alarming manner, until it gradually diminished as the blood coagulated, when the motion became a mere elevation at each stroke of the heart,—the whizzing sound, or thrill, attendant on a rup- tured artery (of a size to require a ligature being understood) is in these cases wanting, constituting a very distinguishing mark of this accident." Surgeons fifty years ago were afraid of haemorrhage from u 2

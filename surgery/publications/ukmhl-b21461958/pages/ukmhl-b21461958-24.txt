ID Military Medical Anecdote. lately seen a greater desire for information in most persons, â– which, if continued, cannot fail to lead to beneficial results. I must also hope that this strong appeal to your judgment, and the earnest recommendation it carries with it, for your atten- tion to these most important injuries, will not fail of success.

When the wound in the ex- ternal parts has been made by an instrument not larger than one- third, or from that to half an inch in width, no attempt to probe or to meddle with the wound, for the purpose of examining the intestine, should be permitted. When the external wound has been made by a somewhat broader and longer instrument, it does not necessarily follow that the intestine should be wounded to an equal extent; and unless it protrude, or the contents of the bowel be discharged through the wound, the surgeon will not be warranted in enlarging the wound in the first instance, \o see what mischief has been done. It may be argued that a wound four inches long lias been proved to be oftentimes as little dangerous as a wound one inch in length; yet most people would prefer having the smaller wound, unless it could be believed that the intestine was injured to a

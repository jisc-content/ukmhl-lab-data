Wounds of the Rectum. 582 difficulty of passing urine. On the third day after his arrival at the San Carlos Hospital, or the sixth from the receipt of the injury, he passed the ball per anuin. The wound quickly closed, and he aided his comrades as an orderly in the hos- pital afterwards. CONCLUSIONS. 421.â€”1. Severe blows on the abdomen give rise to the ab- sorption of the muscular structures, and the formation, in many instances, of ventral hernia; this may in some measure be pre- vented during the treatment, by quietude, by the local abstrac- tion of blood, and by the early use of retaining bandages. 2. Abscesses in the muscular wall of the abdomen, from whatever cause they arise, should be opened early; for although the peritoneum is essentially strong by its outer surface, it is but a thin membrane, and should be aided surgically as much as possible. 3. Severe blows, attended by general concussion, frequently give rise to rupture of the solid viscera, such as the liver and the spleen, causing death by ha3inorrhage. When the hollow viscera are ruptured, such as the intestines or the bladder, death ensues from inflammation. 4. Incised wouuds of the wall of the abdomen to any extent, rarely unite so perfectly (except, perhaps, in the linea alba) as not to give rise to ventral protrusions of a greater or less extent. 5. As the muscular parts rarely unite in the first instance after being divided, sutures should never be introduced into these structures. 6. Muscular parts are to be brought into apposition, and so retained principally by position, aided by a continuous suture through the integuments only, together with long strips of adhesive plaster, moderate compression, and sometimes a retaining bandage. 7. Sutures should never be inserted through the whole wall of the abdomen, and their use in muscular parts under any circumstances is forbidden; unless the wound, from its very great extent, cannot be otherwise sufficiently approximated to

into the Cavity of the Abdomen. 535 after a punctured wound, aud not tympanitic from the extri- cation of air or the distension of the bowel by it, the wound should be enlarged to allow the evacuation of the extravasated blood, which cannot in such quantity be absorbed. The orifice of a small gunshot wound, which is not sufficiently direct to communicate with the cavity, and to allow the issue of blood extravasated in the quantity alluded to, should be enlarged to such extent as to effect that object. 396. Blood effused in moderate quantity and circumscribed by the pressure exercised upon the contents of the abdomen by its parietes, may readily be evacuated by the wound, provided it be sufficiently open; and the patient may recover, if the inflammation which must necessarily ensue, should not be communicated along the peritoneum throughout the cavity, or if it should be subdued in time. If the blood be in small quantity, it coagulates, and may be absorbed; but if in such a quantity as cannot be absorbed, or from any other causes which may prevent its removal by this means, it becomes, after a time, a source of irritation, and nature sometimes com- mences early to cut it off from the general cavity, by sur- rounding it with fibrine,â€”a result which, however desirable, can rarely be expected. "When extravasated blood is thus cut off from the general cavity, and cannot be absorbed, or be by accident carried off through an opening in the bowel, a change takes place, by which it ceases to be bland and harmless, and causes it to excite inflammation and its ordinary consequence, suppuration, if the patient survive so long. This occurs, for the most part! after the first inflammatory symptoms have subsided, from the tenth to the twelfth, or even to a later day; when the re- newal of irritation is accompanied by an increase of the general symptoms, by a more local pain, and by a cir- cumscribed swelling of some part near the wound, in which fluctuation may perhaps be distinguished, even during the existence of the general tenderness of the whole abdomen. Under such circumstances, when it is proposed to make an' incision into this part, if it should he thought advisable to do such an operation, it may safely be preceded by an exploring needle, or a very fine trocar and canula, which will demonstrate

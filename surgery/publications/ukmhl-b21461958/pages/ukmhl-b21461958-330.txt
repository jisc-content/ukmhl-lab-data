320 Injury of Middle Meningeal Artery. meningeal artery, it often gives rise to a more serious injury, which nothing but an operation can remove. The artery is always in a groove, and is often even imbedded in the bone at its lower part, and may be torn at the moment of fracture, giving rise to a gradual extravasation of blood on the surface of the brain, which can be borne to a considerable extent without causing any particular symptoms, although a sudden and considerable effusion causes immediate insensibility. When the extravasation is gradual, the patient walks away after the accident, and converses freely, becoming oppressed slowly, and in the end insensible, as the last drops of blood which are effused render the compression effective. When these symptoms occur after a wound in this particular part, the bone should be immediately examined; if there be no obvious fracture, and relief cannot be obtained by the abstraction of blood, the trephine should be resorted to as a last resource; for if there be truth in the statements so confidently made of frac- ture of the inner table of the bone from concussion of the outer without fracture, it is here especially that we may be permitted to look for it. The hemorrhage in the greater number of these cases takes place slowly, and the effused blood depresses the brain by separating the dura mater from the neighbouring bone -a process, however, which can hardly occur unless the injury has been so violent as to rupture its attachments to the bone; for the brain yields in general rather than the attachments of the dura mater, and is depressed, the hollow or cavity thus formed being filled up by the coagulum, which becomes thicker and thicker until insensibility is induced. Blood effused between the dura mater and the bone readily fills up in the first instance all the space formed by the disruption of the membrane; for the force with which the blood is poured out from the artery overcomes the resistance offered by the brain, which gradually yields and sinks unto that point at which its natural functions can no longer be carried on. If the attach- ments of the dura mater be strong, and the separation which has taken place between it and the bone be small the blood effused is compressed by the bone on one side, on which it can exert no influence, and is resisted by the dura mater, which will recede no further on the other.

492 Lacerations and Ruptures of the Heart. by auscultation. If the cavity of the pleura should fill with blood, it ought to be evacuated to give a chance for life, and if the pericardium should become permanently distended by fluid, it should be evacuated. Lacerations and ruptures of the heart have frequently taken place from blows or other serious contusions. Ollivier, who devoted much time to reading and collecting the observations made by different writers on the injuries of the heart, says," that of forty-nine cases of spontaneous rup- ture of the heart, thirty-four were of the left ventricle, eight only of the right, two of the left auricle, three of the right, and that in two cases both ventricles were torn in several places; and that these results were in an inverse proportion to those which occurred after blows or contusions; the right ventricle being ruptured in eight out of eleven cases, the left ventricle three times; the auricles being also torn in six of these eleven cases; the ruptures not being confined to one spot, but taking place occasionally in several different parts, or even in the same ventricle." In eight of the cases he had noticed, the heart was ruptured in several places. That a spontaneous rupture may be cui-ed as well as a wound, seems likely from a case reported by Rostan, of a woman, who died after fourteen years' suffering with pain about the heart, and was found to have the ventricle ruptured. A cicatrix was observed to the left side of the recent rupture, half an inch in extent in every direction, in which the new matter was evi- dently different from the natural structure of the heart.

Involuntary, Muscular, and Elastic Fibres. 175 remarkable. Protein is soluble in weak alkalies. Since, therefore, the serum of the blood is always slightly alkaline, being a proteate of soda, with sulphur and phosphorus, it keeps the sulpho-phospho protein in solution. This property is the cause of the blood remaining in a liquid state—a chief requi- site for animal life. " If a weak alkaline solution of protein is neutralized by an acid, the solubility of sulpho-phospho protein is greatly dimi- nished. The sulphuric and phosphoric acids, by not dissolving protein, stanch bleeding. Acetic acid, by which protein is dissolved, does not, neither does the hydrochloric. " Protein, according to Mulder,—although it is doubted by Liebig,—is a complex substance, consisting of several hetero- geneous organic compounds united into one whole, easily acted upon by strong reagents. "If a protein compound be brought into contact with an alkali, ammonia is immediately disengaged, and the alkaline solution can hardly be made weak enough to prevent the dis engagement of ammonia. If either fibrine or coagulated albu- men be dissolved in a weak potass ley, ammonia is always perceptible. Protein, therefore, is always in a state of decom- position, as serum is alkaline."

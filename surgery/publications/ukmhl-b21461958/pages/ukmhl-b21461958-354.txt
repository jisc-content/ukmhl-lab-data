Deductions as to Treatment. 344 ing into and irritating the dura mater or brain, they would have been removed, in the belief that although they might not at the moment have given rise to any other symptoms than those -which depended on the blow, the time would come when they would scarcely fail to cause those which usually accompany the formation of matter within the skull. If this danger should also be avoided, the subsequent evils which have been noticed as occurring at a later period, and which ultimately require the same operation for the relief of the patient after months of acute suffering, might be encoun- tered; for although a person may temporarily recover from an injury in which a portion of bone has been allowed to re- main a source of irritation to the brain, it does not follow that such recovery should be permanent. If there be a doubt on the mind of the surgeon whether there be or be not any por- tions depressed and irritating the brain or its membranes, he should wait; this is the real difference between the surgery of the latter part of the Peninsular war and that of the olden time. 272. "When a fracture is accompanied by depression, and the broken portion or portions of bone would seem to be driven into the dura mater or the brain, or to press so unequally upon them that as much mischief is likely to ensue from leaving, as from removing them, especially in an adult or a middle-aged man, less harm will in general follow from ascertaining the fact, by dividing the scalp, and removing the broken pieces, than by doing nothing, more particularly when the presence of a foreign body has been ascertained. If there be no symptoms indicative of mischief below the fractured part, the surgeon must then decide, after the best estimate he is able to make of the probable evil which will occur from allowing the broken or depressed portions of bone to remain. A French grenadier was brought to the field hospital, the second day after the battle of Salamanca; he had received a a blow on the left side of the head, probably from a piece of a shell, which had caused a contusion and swelling on the left parietal bone, with a graze of the scalp, but without any opening communicating with the bone. This swelling on

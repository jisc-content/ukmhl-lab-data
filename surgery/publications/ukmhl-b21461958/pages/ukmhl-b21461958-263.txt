Ligature of the Common Iliac Artery. 253 having a gradual inclination inwards towards the external edge of the rectus muscle, the patient being on his back, with the head and shoulders raised, and the legs bent on the trunk. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle having been opened inferiorly, is to be slit up for the whole length of the external incision; and the director having been first passed under the internal oblique muscle, through a small opening carefully made into it, it is to be divided in a similar manner. The transversalis is then to be cut through at the under part, and its tendinous expansion divided at the upper part, the greatest precaution being taken by the finger to prevent the peritoneum being injured. The fascia transversalis is then to be torn through at the lower and outer part, so that, the fingers may be passed inwards from the ilium, and the peritoneum detached from the iliac fossa, and turned with its contents inwards, by a gradual and sidelong movement of the fore and second fingers inwards and upwards, until, passing over the psoas muscle, the external iliac artery is discovered by its pulsation. It is then to be traced upwards and inwards towards the spine, when the origin of it and of the internal iliac from the common trunk will be felt. The point of the fore-finger will then be nearly in the centre of a line drawn from the umbilicus to the anterior superior spine of the ilium; hence the necessity for an incision six inches in length, if the artery is to be tied high up, which is to be accomplished by tracing it in a similar manner to its origin from the aorta. The common trunk of the iliac arteries and the aorta itself may be tied by the same method of proceeding; the only dif- ference which can be practised with advantage will be to make the incision a little longer at its upper part; no incon- venience arising from the addition to the length of the external wound, whilst the subsequent steps of the operation will be much facilitated by it. The following method of pro- ceeding, adopted in two cases, in which I placed a ligature on the common iliac artery, with a successful result, will bring the operation so graphically before the reader that it cannot be misunderstood, and may be readily followed in operating. I began the operation, the patient lying on the back, by an incision on the fore part of the abdomen, commencing an inch z

176 Voluntary and Involimtary Muscles. fibres are shown, consisting of more or less flattened bands, the fibres of which are soft, and marked with minute granules, sometimes exhibiting traces of nuclei. These purely muscular fibres are most abundant next to the inner coat of the artery, and diminish in number as they approach the outler layer, their place being occupied by firmer and more elastic fibres of a yellow colour, seen collectively in the circular diagram, as line 4, and separately in diagram 3, fig. 4, and in diagram 4. No. 4. The involuntary muscular fibres of an artery are rather smaller than those found in the intestines, bladder, and uterus. The voluntary muscular fibres differ from the involuntary, in having cylindrical fibres, of much larger size, with transverse and longitudinal markings, unlike the flattened fibres of less size of the involuntary muscles, which have also a faintly granular appearance, instead of the more determined trans- verse and longitudinal lines of the voluntary muscles. The outer or elastic layer of the ancient middle coat, repre-

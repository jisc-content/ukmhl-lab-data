If an intestine be divided circularly, in any part, its walls will be found to be composed of three principal coats or tunics which are,—commencing from the inside—the mucous, the muscular, and the serous or peritoneal, each being separated from the other by a layer of areolar tissue. A diagram thus made would show a transverse division of the intestine, and eight distinct, if not all dififerent parts. Beginning from without—viz., serous or peritoneal, areolar or sub-serous; lougitudinal muscular, areolar; transverse muscular, areolar or sub-mucous, and epithelial. The mucous coat in man has a peculiarity not observable in animals, of ledges or shelves projecting into its cavity. When the mucous coat of the duodenum is examined with the naked eye, the first part of its course presents a tolerably smooth appearance, gradually, however, becoming irregular in transverse folds, which are so numerous, marked, and regular, in the jejunum and ileum, as to have obtained, from the earliest times, the name of valvulse conniventes. They are most strongly marked in the jejunum, and gradually dis- appear towards the lower part of the ileum, the inner surface

133 LECTURE VIII. Secondary amputations not so successful after injuries as after incurable disease; circumstances under which the operation is performed in military surgery, and the consequencesj secondary hcemorrhage ; non-union of'the stump; phlebitis and sloughing of the stump; depositions of matter in the viscera; in secondary amputations larger flaps required, or the bone to be cut shorter; directions for sawing the bone; larger number of arteries to be tied; torsion of a/rteries; bleeding from a small branch, cut short, above the ligature; mode of avoiding this; use of the tourniquet, and its inconveniences; in oozing of blood, the wound not to be finally closed for some hows; treatment in cases of non-union; cat-gut or other animal ligatures; hcemorrhage from large veins to be controlled by pressure, not by ligatures; if the bone be too long, a piece to be sawn off; consequences of not doing so. Com- pound Fractures: definition of; comminuted; compound frac- ture of the arm or leg does not necessitate amputation; of the thigh, amputation is requisite; difficulty of treating a gun-shot fracture, with extensive splintering of the bone; consequences of the splintering; necrosis of the bone, and formation of sequestra; lodgment of a ball in, or its passage through a bone, without splintering; consequences; its removal requisite when lodged in a bone; mere grazing a bone by a ball; simple transverse fracture of a bone by a ball; flattening of the ball, and its lodgment between the broken portions of a bone; extensive shattering of the femur, a case for immediate amputation; gun-shot fractures of head and neck of the femur; excision of the injivred portions of bone—if the upper third, or middle of the bone, amputation ne- cessary; in fractures of the lower third, not communicating with the knee-joint, an attempt to be made to save the limb; when the femwr is splintered, if the limb is to be saved, the principal splinters to be removed; the necessan-y incisions often neglected; if the splinters cannot be got at, amputation is requisite ; secondm-y danger from the smaller splinters; a careful examination to be made for them when suppwralion is established, and incisions made if requisite for their removal; consequences of their reten- tion ; proper bedsteads for the wounded should form a part of mili- »

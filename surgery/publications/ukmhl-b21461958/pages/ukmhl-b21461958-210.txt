200 Effects of a Ligature on an Artery. by four distinct layers or structures, are not only divided, but the inner ones particularly appear to be curled inwards on themselves, so that the cut edge of one half or side is not ap- plied to its fellow in the usual way of two surfaces, but by curl- ing inwards meets its opponent on every point of a circle, and in this way forms a barrier inside that of the external coat, which is tied around it by the ligature: so that in fact when a small ligature is firmly tied, its direct pressure is not applied to the inner coats, which have been divided, and have curled away from it, but to the two layers of the outer coat, which is in consequence of that pressure made to ulcerate or slough, which processes could scarcely fail to take place also in the other coats, if they were subjected to pressure in a similar manner. The cut edges of the four inner layers being from this provision of nature perfectly free, are capable of taking on the process of inflammation, which stops at the adhesive stage. This they do by the effu- sion of lymph or fibrin both within and without, to a greater or less extent as the case may require. The outer coat of the artery must either yield by ulceration or sloughing, or the liga- ture must remain until it is decomposed and destroyed. The artery usually yields by sloughing, and the ligature is left at liberty by the ulceration which takes place in the sound part of the artery immediately above and below the part strangu- lated by the ligature, and which part is frequently brought away in the noose. The artery does not always yield by sloughing, particularly if it is a large one, and the ligature has beeu thick and soft. In this case a part of the outer coat, and par- ticularly the white inelastic substance, from its foldiug or plaiting under the ligature, seems to escape that degree of pressure necessary to destroy it, and when the remaining part yields, it remains entire, and is only removed by a subse- quent process of ulceration, occasioned by its irritation as an extraneous body. In such cases the layers of the external coat could not close around the inner ones; which are thus shown to be capable of forming an effectual barrier without it, although it materially assists in giving greater strength to the cicatrix, by the effusion of fibrin which takes place within, without, and around.

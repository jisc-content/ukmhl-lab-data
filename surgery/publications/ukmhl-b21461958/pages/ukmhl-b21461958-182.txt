The efforts resorted to by nature for the suppression of serious hemorrhages depend on the capabilities of the arteries as resulting from their structure, into which it becomes an object of importance minutely to inquire. With this view, the old division of an artery into three coats may be continued; the difference between ancient and modern anatomy being in their subdivision into different textures, or layers. The annexed diagram shows the edge of a large artery, which has been divided circularly, and magnified so as to exhibit s.x layers in a distinct manner; each of the three ancient coats are divided into two. The inner or old serous coat, is shown to be

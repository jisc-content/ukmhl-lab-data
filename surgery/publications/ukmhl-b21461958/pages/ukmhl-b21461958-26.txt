14 Wounds of the Diaphragm. returned to his duty. Ou the 6th of September, nearly fifteen months afterwards, he was attacked, after cleaning his horse, by all the symptoms of a strangulated internal rupture, and died next day. On opening the body, the greater part of the stomach was found to have passed through a hole in the diaphragm, made by the sword, and had become strangulated, like any other part constituting a hernia or rupture. The moral of these stories is yet to come. A respectably dressed woman, of a middle age, by which something between forty and fifty may be understood, came into my room one morning, saying she " was sent to show me her domen." Seeing that I hesitated, and did not appear to understand, she added, " the mark of the cut, Sir, made by Mr. , in my stomach, fourteen inches, Sir, from the end of the breast-bone, to the bone below."

Since that period, it is calculated that 150 or 160 operations of a nearly similar naturehave been done; one I saw myself precisely similar, the woman dying of bleeding after several days. Obstetricians or accoucheurs, the class of gentlemen who have generally done these things, have re- commended, some a cut of ten, some of eight, some of six, some of four inches, instead of fourteen; but whether the cut be longer or shorter, one third of the sufferers only have escaped with life; and the operation is not considered quite as successful as might be wished, more particularly as the complaint is usually one of great inconvenience and dis-

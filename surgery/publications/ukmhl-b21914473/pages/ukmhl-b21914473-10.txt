The pathology and treatment of injmdes of the skull was at that date most imperfectly understood, and the Academy gave out as one of the subjects for competition :— “ To establish the theory of injuries of the head by Contre- coup, and the practical conclusions to be derived therefrom.” The prize was awarded to Saucerote’s Essay, based on literary research, clinical observations, and 21 experiments on living dogs.* Amputation at the hip joint was only attempted after it w’as proved safe by vivisection. “ The Academy is informed, says its Secretary Greneral, that this operation has been performed with success on dogs.”f After relating the experimental proofs for that statement, the Secretary observes, “ These memorable trials should awaken the desire to do as much on the higher animals, and to encourage Army Surgeons, wdio have the greatest oppor- tunity, to undertake this operation after battles; for by it, probably, patients might be saved who are now left to their fate.” Experiments on brutes enlightened and nerved to action the practitioners of human surgery, and amputation at the hip joint, the direct outcome of vivisections, has re- sulted in saving many valuable lives, which otherwise must infallibly have perished. While Louis XV. and his court were patronizing the Academy, a few’ Englishmen dotted over the country, but chiefly in the provinces, were by their own unaided efforts leading up to a surgical revival of unequalled brilliancy.

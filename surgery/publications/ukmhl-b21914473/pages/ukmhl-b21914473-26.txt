When I undertook to deliver this address, I did not merely propose to recall historical evidence of the saving of pain and life to man, which experiments on brutes have ex- ercised on human surgery. I felt deeply, as the vast majority of the medical profession do, all the world over, the straight in which our colleagues are placed, who are charged with the study and teaching of physiology in Great Britain. As a group, they are in our front scientiflc rank, for merit and responsibility. The knowledge which they possess and promote, is es.‘?ential to all who practice our diflicult profession. Their teaching is the very foundation of the training of the pupils who enter our surgical wards. British Physiologists stand before the country accused of cruelty, dogged by spies, and liable to criminal prosecution for doing that, which some of the Avisest and best men of the Avorld haA^e done for the lasting benefit and honour of man- kind.

Patient and friends say “ we are in yoim hands, do as you think best.”

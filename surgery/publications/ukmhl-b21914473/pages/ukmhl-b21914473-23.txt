21 instruments, admits of very great extension; but it may be useful and interesting, at this stage, briefly to review the influence of the school of experiment generally, and of scientific experiments on living animals in particular, on the progress of surgery through the education of some of its leaders. Surgery was only a tangled mass of empirical knowledge, handed do^vn by tradition, until it came to be studied as a branch, and with the aid, of other departments of experi- mental science. Eeverting to our date of 1750, the quarter of a century which preceded and followed was singularly productive of naturalists and surgeons, physicists, chemists and astronomers, assisting each other and advancing on the same lines of observations and inductions. In 1728 John Hunter and Joseph Black were born. In the next five years followed Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729), Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley (1733). Lavoisier saw the light in 1743, and in the succeeding lustre Dessault (1744), Yolta (1745), Scarpa (1747), Jenner and La Place (1749). The five years (1764—69) were even more prolific, with Abernethy (1764), Larrey (1766), Astley Cooper, Humboldt and Cuvier (1769),—the epoch year which also gave the world Xapoleon and Wellington, Brunei and James Watt. Only three years later commenced the brief but brilliant career of Xavier Bichat, to be followed closely by an accession of some of the world’s greatest physiologists, surgeons and physicists, to wit Charles Bell (1774), Delpeche and Dupuytren (1774), Humphrey Davy (1778) and Berzelius (1779). One and all were original observers, working out the results of experiments according to the rules of the inductive philosophy. Everyone of the

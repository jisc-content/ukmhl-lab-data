10 it was, only represents the partial results of his method. It was the impetus which he gave to experimental enquiry, amongst his contemporaries and successors, that stamped his genius and inspired his school. As an illustration of the fertility of a comparatively trifling experiment, take the division of the tendo achillis in dogs? which John Hunter practised, to study the process by which divided tendons are united. He was led to the research by rupture of his own tendo achillis, curiously enough while dancing, the very year of his election into the Koyal Society. The experimental results so obtained led on to sub-cutaneous surgery, one of the most useful and life saving reforms in the art.* No one laboured more successfully than did Antonio Scarpa to demonstrate and extend Hunter’s teaching on Aneurism, and we are expressly told by Scarpa,f that he experimented on living dogs, sheep, oxen and horses, and on the information so obtained he founded his practice and teaching in the surgical wards and lecture theatre of the University of Pavia. An ardent admirer of John Hunter’s teaching, Abernethy put it to the hitherto untried test of ligaturing the iliac artery for aneurism of the femoral close to Poupart’s liga- nient.J His patient died, but Gfeorge Freer performed the operation with success, on a young Scotchman, at the Birmingham Greneral Hospital, 19th September, 1806.§ ^Palmer’s edition of J.

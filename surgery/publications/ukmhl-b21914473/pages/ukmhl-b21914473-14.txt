12 quote the conclusion of Dr. Jones’ preface, in defence of the practice of vivisection. “ He has only a few more words to say, addressed to men out of the pale of his profession, into whose hands this little book may fall, whose opinions he esteems and w^hose feelings he honours. He regrets the necessity of obtaining even this important knowledge by the sacrifice of brutes. But when we remember the incessant scourge of war which has follow’ed man through all ages of his history,—not to mention the consequences of accident and disease,—it is not too much to assert, that thousands might have been, and may still be saved by-a perfect knowledge of these subjects, which can only be directly obtained by experiments on brutes; indirectly and very slowly, by observations on the injured arteries of man, and even these cannot be made until he has fallen a sacrifice to the want of assistance, or to the' imperfect knowdedge of the Surgeon.” JMuch yet remained to be done to obtain our present knowledge of haemostatics. The time had now arrived for the English-speaking race beyond the Atlantic to lend their powerful aid; and by experimental researches on the use of animal ligatures, and on the tolerance of the animal tissues for metallic substances, the Americans grafted important facts on the common stock. Amussat revived the torsion of arteries, and Luigi Porta, the successor of Antonio Scarpa, instituted a great number of experiments on living animals to test the relative merits of ligature and torsion with a variety of materials and methods.* Time renders it impossible to name all the other authors who have laboured in the same direction. It will be sufficient to ^ *Dolle Alterazioni Patologiche delle Arterie per la Legatura e la Torsione. Esperienze ed Oaservazioni di Luigi Porta, pp. 837, con tredici Tavole in Rame Milano, 1845.

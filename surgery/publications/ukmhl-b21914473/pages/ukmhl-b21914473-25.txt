23 Brodie and Sir James Paget, the leaders of British surgery for the last half century. If you want to know what Brodie thought of scientific experiments on living animals in laying the foundation of a Surgeon’s knowledge, read his physio- logical researches, which, so late as 1851, when full of wisdom and honours, he deemed it worth while to collect, in the original papers published forty years previously in the Philosophical Transactions. If Sir James Paget’s recent article in the Nineteenth Century leave you in any doubt as to his opinion on the matter in question, be good enough to read his Lectures on Surgical Pathology, edited by Professor Turner of Edinburgh. If you want to know what Germany thinks on the subject, read Professor Virchow’s address before the late International Medical Congress Ueber den werth des Pathologischen Experiments ”). With illustrious individual exceptions, the Germans were backward in the race for Medical fame. They had nothing to compare with the French Academy of Surgery. Our Pre-Hunterian Surgeons were incomparably superior to their Pre-Hallerians. They had no match for Morgagni and his pupil Scarpa. But once they perceived the great truth, once they set out on the high road of experiment, their impetus was overwhelming and their conquests have brought them to the fore all along the line. Irony of fate ! That a countryman of Stahl and Hahne- man should, in the year of grace 1881, have had to defend before the greatest of all known Medical assemblies, the value of scientific experiments on living animals in the fatherland of William Harvey and the Hunters, standing as the great German scientist did, addressing his memorable audience, within a few yards of the Old Windmill Street School of glorious experimenta] memory. The contrast could scarcely

great surgeons named did some of his best work, in widening and solidifying the foundations and raising the edifice of human surgery, by experiments on living animals. The one surgeon amongst them w'ho did the least in that direction, illustrates in a particular manner the great value of such research. To Charles Bell, experiments on living animals were specially abhorrent; yet, without them, it would have been impossible for him to discover that sensory and motor impulses travel along different routes of spinal nerves, and that ganglions are not intended to cut off sensation as was universally held, up to his day. To those who doubt the influence of vivisections on Charles Bell, I would suggest the reading of only eight pages of his numerous works. From page 29 to 36 inclusive of the introduction to “ The Nervous System of the Human Body,” embracing the papers delivered by Charles Bell to the Royal Society on the subject of the nerves'^' is a succinct account of the substance of his chief discoveries, and of the processes by which he arrived at them. Vivisections were absolutely indispensable to him, and he performed them. Had he possessed sufficient firmness of resolve to subjugate his emotions to his reason, he would have experimented more, and speculated less. So doing he could not have failed to forestall Marshall Hall, and to have achieved a position amongst discoverers not inferior to William Harvey’s.f Through Everard Home and Dr. Baillie, John Abernethy, Astley Cooper and William Lawrence,—through the Hunt- erian Museum and its worthy conservator and commentator Richard Owen, the influence of John Hunter’s work has come down, by unbroken links, to the first Sir Benjamin *London : Longman’s, 1S30. tSee Dr. Michael Foster’s address on Physiology to Int.

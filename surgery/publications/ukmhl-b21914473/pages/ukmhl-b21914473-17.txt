It was Shipton,* an English student of surgery, who in the early part of the last century made the following experiment. He cut away a portion, equal to two fingers breadth, of the ileum of a dog, connected the extremities by an uninterrupted suture, and closed the external wound. The dog recovered, but the experiment bore little if any fruit until it was taken up by Benjamin Travers, who, through his master Astley Cooper, was a direct descendant of John Hunter’s school. Mr. Travers, acknowledging his indebtedness to Shipton^ instituted a series of experiments on living animals, and with the results so obtained, sought to reform the practise of human surgery. In his own words, “ The benefit which has of late years resulted to practical surgery from a diligent study of those secret processes by which nature accomplishes her operations, furnishes, I conceive, an irresistible argument for the necessity of experiments on brutes. It is a weak objection, although urged by some respectable authorities, that the difference of economy in animals of different species does not warrant the application of similar conclusions. Granting the points of difference, it cannot be denied that the points of analogy in the general structure and functions of all animals of the same class, infinitely preponderate. And as human anatomy would have been yet very imperfect, and physiology altogether a conjectural science without the advantage which this analog}^ has afforded, it is reasonable to presume that the doctrines^ of pathology must admit of a similar mode of illustration.”f The monograph in which Mr. Benjamin Travers recorded his observations w’as at once “Observatio de Portione intestini Canis feliciter abscissd, in Phil.

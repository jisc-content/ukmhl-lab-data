17 knife of the upper extremity of the human stomach blocked with cancer; a disease which, in that situation at any rate, has never been proved curable by other means. Before attacking it, Pean, of Paris, operated experimentally on brutes, then on man. His patient died ; but Billroth, and his assistant Wolfler, of Vienna, succeeded. My good friend Nicolaysen, of Christiania, followed; but in spite of his well-known skill, his patient died in fifteen hours. Nothing daunted Czerny, of Heidelberg, returned to the chax’ge. His patient had been greatly reduced in weight by ten weeks constant vomiting. The enormously distended stomach reached actually to the pubes, and contained a tumour near the pylorus as large as a child’s fist. Czerny opened the abdomen, then made an exploratory incision into the stomach, and removed the cancer. The operation lasted more than two hours. The wound healed without a sign of inflammation. There was no vomiting—no pain. The patient took some soup on the second day, meat on the fifth, got up the twentieth day, gained eleven pounds in weight the next fortnight, and then returned to his usual occupations.* Warranting, as such cases do, the placing of cancer of the stomach amongst diseases curable by the knife, do they not also justify the vivisection of dogs by Shipton and Travers, who, by their experiments, laid the first scientific foundation of intra-abdominal surgery. Even the brave Liston in 1840 denounced the surgeon who opened the abdomen, in^quest of tumours, in unsparing terms like these, “ The result has been such as to render the perpetrator indictable for culpable homicide, and to qualify for such punishment as his rash and reckless conduct richly deserved.” Had Liston been spared to know the triumphs * Transactions of the London International Medical Congress, 1881, toI.

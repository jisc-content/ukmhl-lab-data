In 1750 appeared “ A Critical Enquiry into the Present State of Surgery by Samuel Sharpe, F.K.S., Surgeon to Gruy’s Hospital,”—a work which supplies an authoritative standard of the state of surgical knowledge at that period. Of the means for arresting hemorrhage after amputations, Mr. Sharpe says, “ The actual cautery was certainly the most to be depended upon, and was therefore through a succession of ages down to our own days more frequently employed than any of the other means But the horror created by a red hot iron begat in some men an invincible antipathy to the method. Some surgeons applied arsenic and corrosive sublimate to the bleeding vessels, &c.” There is an account of “ nineteen men wdio, only one excepted, all died after amputations, and, as it was supposed, chiefly from the poisonous quality of the sublimate.”* This was the state of surgery in 1750, 158 years after the death of Pare. He, it was, who revived the ancient practice of ligaturing blood vessels, but in such an imperfect manner as to exercise comparatively little influence. Hying in 1692, when William Harvey, a lad of 14, was scanning Latin verses in Canterbury Grrammar School, the great Huguenot knew little or nothing of the circulation of the blood. To tie an artery Pare transflxed the tissues from without, very much in the same fashion that an upholsterer quilts a mattress, or he included in the ligature muscular and other tissues, for the purpose of securing better hold.f His con- temporary Fabricius ab Aquapendente, Harvey’s teacher of anatomy, argues against the ligature of arteries, and prefers *^Sharpe of cit. p. 279-SO. t OEuvres compltStes d’Ambroise Pare par J.

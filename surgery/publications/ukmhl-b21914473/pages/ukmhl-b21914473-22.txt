20 in the course of the winter, 1854, I |made a series of experiments on living animals in the laboratory of Mr. Fluorens at the Jardin des Plantes. The crushing instrument applied to the dog’s tongue, completely divided it in its thickest part. “ In experiments on the lingual tissue of living animals, we obtained this constant result,—when the crushing was conducted slowly, the solution of continuity was dry, and there was no hemorrhage, neither primary nor secondary, and healing was rapid. . . . But when the crushing was done quickly, hemorrhage occurred. ‘^In experiments performed at the Grenelle slaughter- house with Veterinar}^-Surgeon Charlier, the 1st October, 1854, we found that the carotid artery of a sheep could be divided without hemorrhage. “ Section of the ovarian arteries of a cow, by the same same process, yielded the same results. “ It was very important to know w^hat was the effect of linear crushing on the sensibility of living tissues; theory pointed to intolerable pains, experience belied them. After the first efforts of the pinching, produced by the pressure of the nerves in the instrument, the strangled part swells and loses all sensibility.” These results have been constantly verified in, operations on the human subject. In obtaining that evidence, pain was doubtless inflicted on many brutes; but balance against that the saving of pain and life which has resulted to countless human beings ; for, since Chassaignac perfected it, the ecraseur has been constantly in use by surgeons in all parts of the world. This recital of the beneficial influence of vivisections on the improvement efiected in surgical operations and

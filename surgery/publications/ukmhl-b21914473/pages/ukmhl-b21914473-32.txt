30 and oui shortcomings. Try some psychological blood transfu- sion in some of your leaders,—enlist a few more Bishops Fraser and Magee,—more Senior Wranglers like Henry of Worcester,—try an order of preachers who shall beableto illus- trate the doctrine of the correlation of forces as a link in the chain of evidence of the Unity of Creation,—men who shall be able to preach a course of sermons on the second chapter of Genesis, and the eighth chapter of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans,—men of large tender hearts and big cultured brains Such men might not find it so very difficult to reconcile science with religion, if called to comfort a sorrowing experimenter. It might possibly not he easy to console him with the Bull “ Ineftabilis Deus,” the Apocalypse, or the Athanasian Creed ; but the Sermon on the Mount, or the 23rd Psalm, would stand a better chance. If a downcast man of science beaten in the struggle, sick, poor, and lonely, were very doubting, cold, unsympa- thetic, and inarticulate under the paralyzing influence of his pent-up feelings, the abstract assertion of dogmatic truth might not find a ready listener. Then let a spiritual adviser arrange for bringing to the poor man’s ear, from a Music Temple, a telephone singing in the accents rf a Mozart, an Auber, or a Rossini, John Henry Newman’s hymn,— Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom. Lead Thou me on ; The night is dark, and I am far from home, Lead Thou me on. Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see The distant scene, one step enough for me. I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou Shouldst lead me on ; I loved to choose and see my path, but now Lead thou me on. I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears. Pride ruled my will : remember not past years.

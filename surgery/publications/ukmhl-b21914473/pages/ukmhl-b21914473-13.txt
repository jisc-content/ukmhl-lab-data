11 ]\Ir. Freer prepared himself for the great experiment on the human subject by tying the arteries of living dogs and horses; and he expressly tells us, that, at the most critical moment of tying James McDonald’s iliac, he acted according to the experiments of Dr. Jones, who carried out and justified the most elaborate series of vivisections on the vascular system. ]\Ir. Greorge Freer’s monograph on Aneurism was illus- trated by his pupil Mr. Joseph Hodgson, who rose to even greater repute, by his Treatise on the diseases of arteries and veins, containing the Pathology and Treatment of Aneurism and Wounded Arteries.J Following the example of his master, and of Scarpa and Hunter, Mr. Hodgson deemed it necessary to the saving of human life and pain, to eiilighten his mind and train his hands by experiments on living brutes; and the identical method was pursued by Astley Cooper (* *), Benjamin Travers (*), and William Law- rence (*). Mr. Copland Hutchison in his Practical Observations on Surgery (f) has expressly recorded that the experiments on the arteries of living dogs and horses performed by Dr. Jones, Mr. Travers, and himself “ suggested a valuable improvement in the mode of tying arteries for the cure of Aneurism, and justified a trial of it on the human subject.” Having incidentally alluded to the experimental Treatise of Dr. F. D. Jones “ On the process employed by nature in suppressing the hemorrhage^” &c.,§ a Treatise cited as a Text by all the great surgeons who succeeded him, I beg leave to t London ISIO.

Definition.—Epilepsy is a disease character- ised by the recurrence of paroxysmal seizures of greater or less severity, the dominant feature of which is a sudden loss or impairment of consciousness, and which is not necessaril}^ due to any obvious organic disease of the brain, its membranes, or its blood-vessels. The feature whose presence is necessary to establish the diagnosis of epilepsy may consist of anything, from a momentary blurring up to complete abolition of consciousness. The con- vulsive element is not essential; if it occurs it may vary from a slight involuntary deviation

452 GLANDERS (FARCY) culture, successfully iufected donkeys, cats, and guinea-pigs. Working with fluid culture-media, they concluded that the specific agent was a coccus growing in chains. 0. Israel (1883) obtained cultures on blood-serum from horses, and successfully infected rabbits with the bacillus, whilst Kitt (1883-84) and Weichselbaum (1885) confirmed and extended the knowledge gained. III. Geographical Distribution and Pre- valence.—Though glanders is not as prevalent as it used to be, nevertheless it is the most dangerous equine disease. It would appear as if glanders can occur in any climate, but it certainly exhibits a predilection for certain localities. Its gradual increase as we go south (the reason of this is unknown) is evident from the figures given by Krabbe for 1857-1873 per 100,000 horses: Norway 6, Denmark 8'5, England 14, Wurtemberg 77, Prussia 78, Servia 95, Belgium 138, France 1130, Algiers 1548. During the years 1877-1887 there were 4 per 100,000 in Sweden (Lindqvist), 300 per 100,000 in Austria. During 1884-1897 in Germany the frequency was 20 - 30 per 100,000. In European Russia glanders is very prevalent, being estimated at 400 per 100,000. In 1898 there were 1380 horses attacked in England (almost entirely in metro- politan districts), 138 in Belgium; there were 657 outbreaks in France and 17 in Denmark. In Hungary the loss from glanders was 39 per 100,000 in 1897; and in the same year Italy lost 277, and Switzerland 58 horses (dead' and killed). Sanders (1896) says glanders has been known but recently in South Africa. Davalos (1894) says it was introduced into Cuba in 1872 (9 cases between 1888 and 1893). Penna (1898) reports it from the Argentine Republic, and v. Velzen from the Dutch East Indies. It also occurs in the U.S. and Canada, IV. Animals affected.—The disease occurs spontaneously in the horse, mule, donkey, and at times in menageries (lion, leopard, tiger, bear). A number of other animals, have, however, been found susceptible to experimental infection. The difference in the statements of authors regarding the degrees of susceptibility of certain animals to inoculation would seem to depend in part upon variation in the virulence and the amount of the culture used. Highly susceptible are field-mice, Arvicola arvalis, A. terrestris in Europe, A. riparius, A. austerus in America, Spermophilus guttaius and *S'. Citilhis in Eastern Europe, Spermophilus Townsendi and S. Richardsoni in America, the cat, guinea-pig, hedgehog (Erinaceus europeus). White and house-mice are more resistant, though susceptible to virulent cultures. Rabbits, the goat, sheep, camel, and young dog have been successfully infected. The resistance of adult dogs has been overcome by inoculating cultures whose virulence had been raised by intracerebral inoculation in another dog. Yoving pigs have been success- fully infected by inoculation into the anterior chamber of the eye or into the lungs, but not through the skin. Adult pigs, unless weakened, are absolutely resistant, as are also cattle (including the calf), chicken, pigeon, linnet, and frog (Loffler, 1886; Kitt, Weichselbaum, 1885; Csokor, 1888; Peuchu, 1889; Straus, 1889; Preusse, Griinwald, Salmon, Sanarelli, Kranzfeld, Cadeac and Malet, Tartakowski, Dschunkowski, 1886-99). V. Bacteriology. — The Bacillus mallei is found in the affected tissues and organs and their secretions, as also the discharges from ulcers, etc. They may be very generallj' dis- tributed in the body. In man, the horse, sheep, guinea-pig, and rabbit, they have been isolated and cultivated from nodules, cutaneous abscesses, the greatly enlarged skin follicles, ulcers of the mucous membranes, more rarely from marrow and blood. They have been found in the saliva and milk, but still oftener in the urine secreted by kidneys showing no appreciable lesion. In man they have been found in the abscesses and blood (few) during life. In the horse they may appear in the blood during a febrile attack or after a mallein injection. They are more numerous in the blood in acute cases. It is often difficult to find the bacilli microscopically in the nodules, but their presence may be demonstrated by cultures or inoculations upon animals (Lofffer, Weichselbaum, Ferraresi and Guarnieri, Lissitzin, Preusse, Babes, Hallopeau and Jeanselme, Bonome, Duval, Gasne and Guillemot, Noniewitz, Kitt, Trambusti, Philip- owitcz (1886-98). Morphology. — The form of the glanders bacillus varies greatly. The bacilli measure 1-5-3 by 0-25-0-4 /x. They have rounded extremities, and are often slightly curved. Noniewitz (1891) claims to have observed diiferences in the form of bacilli within the body. In acute cases well-formed bacilli are en- countered, in subacute and chronic cases more highly refractive coccus-like bodies are found, which suggests that many of them degenerate in the body. Gutzeit (1892), as also Johne, finds the bacilli are larger when grown in horse- bouillon than when cultivated in beef-broth. Already Loffler observed club-shaped, fila- mentous, and coccus-like forms in culture, and this has since been seen and described by Kranzfeld, Levy, Semmer, Marx, and Galli- Valerio (1887-99); the two latter, as also Conradi (1900), have in addition observed true branching in organisms grown in culture. Lubarsch (1899) was unable to observe branched actinomyces-forms in rabbits which had been inoculated into the kidney or subdurally. The glanders bacilli do not form spores. Refractive bodies which have been considered to be spores by Baumgarten (1888) are almost certainly

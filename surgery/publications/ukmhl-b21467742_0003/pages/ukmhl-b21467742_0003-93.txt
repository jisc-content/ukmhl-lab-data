EMBRYOLOGY, HUMAN 77 gestions—tliat the ovum passes or sends pro- cesses into the mouths of the uterine glands—is that which nearly all embryologists nowadays agree in rejecting, and that apparently on good grounds. therefore, still use the term decidua reflexa, without, of course, holding the Hunterian view of its formation.

According to the view we take of tlie manner of mooring of the ovum in utero will be the theory we hold of the mode of formation of the decidua reflexa (s. capsuhn-is). John Hunter's conception of its origin has been abandoned, but there seems no reason sufficient to warrant the abandonment of the name which he gave to it; names in medicine do not always retain their original and etymological meaning. I shall, us the means of imagining how the reflexa is formed, for its age Avas five or six days, and this decidual membrane was still in process of dif- ferentiation. The specimen showed the ovum entirely sunk in the compact layer of the decidua vera about the middle of the posterior wall of the uterus. Over each side of the ovum was an extension of the vera forming the outermost portion of the refle.xa, and the central portion

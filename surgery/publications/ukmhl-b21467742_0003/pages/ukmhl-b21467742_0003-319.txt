FLUIDS, EXAMINATION OF PATHOLOGICAL 303 sistence and specific gravity. Under normal conditions it is present in such small quantity that it has never been analysed. Pathologically, it may be serous, sero-fibrinous, sero-purulent, or purulent, and hence it varies greatly in specific gravity, owing to the varying amounts of proteid present. In hydrothorax the specific gravity is usually much lower than in pleuritis (as a rule being about I'd), owing to the fact that the amount of proteid in the former condi- tion is from 1 to 3 per cent, while in the latter about 3 to 7 per cent is present. The specific gravity in pleuritis is very often higher than 1-020. The total solids in some cases of empyema may rise to 10 per cent. The following table gives the results of some analyses made by Halliburton:— the degenerating pus cells will Ix' present. All or some of the substances referi-ed to as occurring in transudates, lymph, etc., may be met witli in the ascitic fluid, e.g. urea, uric acid, glucose, etc. Case. Sp. Gr. Proteid percent- age.

Hydrothorax (heart disease) 1-016 1-482 0-013 0-779 0-700 Peritoneal Fluid.—Normally the quantity of this fluid is small, but under different patho- logical conditions it may undergo a very marked increase. If the increase in the fluid be due to the so-called hydrtemic condition of the blood, or, more important, if it arise from venous con- gestion, then the fluid has the typical characters of a transudate, that is to say, it is of low specific gravity, clear and watery in appearance, coagu- lating only with great difliculty, and almost free from former elements. Under such conditions the amount of proteid varies, as a rule, from about 0-5 to 3 per cent. In inflammatory pro- cesses the fluid poured out is characterised especially by the presence of formed elements by its comparatively high specific gravity, and by the fact that it rapidly undergoes coagulation. In appearance it is also cliftercnt from the transu- dates, being usually cloudy, and often of a slightly brown tint, owing to admixture with blood pigment. The ascitic fluid may be rich in fat, especially in the so-called chylous ascites due to rupture of the lacteals, tlie percentage often rising as high as 4-5 per cent. In addition to serum albumin and serum globulin mucin may be present, which can be detected in the filtrate obtained after boiling and acidifying the fluid. This last-mentioned proteid on boiling with weak acids furnishes glucose. If fluid from an ovarian cyst should become mixed with the peritoneal fluid, then instead of, or in addition to, mucin, another closely allied proteid, pseudo- muciu, may occur in the filtrate. This body is distinguished from mucin by the fact that it is not precipitated by acetic acid. If the fluid be purulent, then the constituents derived from obtained in different conditions. He estimated the amount of proteids and also calculated the percentage by Keuss' formula from the specific gravity. Reuss' formula is P = |(S - 1000) - 2-8 (P = Proteid per cent, S = Sp. Gravity (reckoned for 1000)). Cereh-o-spinal Fluid.—In chronic hydroce- phalus this fluid is of low specific gravity, containing only a small percentage of solids (1-2- to 2 per cent). These include globulin, albumose, rarely albumin, glucose, inorganic salts, and probably pyrocatechin. Ovarian Cysts. — The serous cysts of the Graafian follicles contain a fluid which is of low s^Jecific gravity (1-003 to 1-020), and therefore poor in solids. It does not difter fi'om the other serous fluids previously described. Proliferous Ovarian Ci/sts.— In the smaller ones the fluid is much thicker than in the larger ones, and is usually more or less colloidal in nature. In some cases it may almost be as firm as a jelly, while in others it is a stringy, viscid fluid. It has usually a bluish white, ojaalescent appearance, \mt it is often also yellow or brown in colour, due to the presence of broken-down blood pigment. The reaction is usually alkaline. The specific gravity varies very much, in some cases being as high as 1-050, and in the same- way the amount of solids varies. The fluid, as a rule, does not coagulate on standing. The- most important constituent is the chai'actcristic proteid, pseudomucin, whicii possesses, in common- with the mucins, a carbohydrate radicle, but, unlike them, it is not precipitated hy acetic acid. The substance termed " colloid,''wiiich is said to occur in these cystic tumours, is not well

But what is it that consti- tutes a suitable mooring place, and by what means is the anchorage rendered tenable ? Per- haps there is found an area of mucous mem- brane without its epithelial covering (or its cilia) where the blastodermic vesicle can reach con- nective tissue; perhaps there is a little slit in the ridge, and projecting downwards on each side of it fills also the adjacent furrows, and so remains till neighbouring parts grow up and around it; perhaps it bores its way downward through the epithelium by the destructive or phagocytic action of its covering cells, and the little opening through which it passes is closed with a coagn- lum. It is easy to multiply suppositions. Curiously enough one of the most obvious sug-

Fecundity. — Productiveness ; fertility ; prolificacy; the capacity of bearing young; the probable fecundity of any marriage will depend upon a number of factors, including the age of the parents (especially of the mother) at mai'riage, the health of the parents (as regards syphilis, alcoholism, etc.), the use of checks to conception, heredity, the presence or absence of malformations or diseases of the genital organs, etc. The average fecundity of a marriage in Great Britain is about 4'5 births. In the lower animals feeding would appear to have a marked effect. Twinning and fecundity would seem to be related, and Jewish women are said to be very prolific. A case is referred to in the Journal des sciences medicales de Lille (Jan. 26, 1901) in which a woman is said to have given birth to 62 infants (41 female and 21 male) in 20 years, including twins (many times), quadruplets, quintuplets, and sextuplets (!).

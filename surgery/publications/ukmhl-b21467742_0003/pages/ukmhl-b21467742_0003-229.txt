Fkj. 1.—8ub-conjiuictival dislocation of lens caiisinft sympathetic disease(uni:siial result). The edges of the ciliary rupture are kept apart by the lens. The entire UN eal tract is uniformly and markedly thickened to several times its normal diameter, a condi- tion characteristic of symjiathetic disease. Fig. 2.—Puncture wound of cornea causing suppurative hyalitis and detachment of retina witli cystic space in the posterior portion of the retina. Fig. 3.—Puncture wound of cornea causing jiurulent cyclitis, the exudation in ciliary region and posterior surface of lens stretching towards the back of the eye, where well-marked papiUo-retinitis is seen. Fig. 4.—Old lost eye —a mere stump—which caused after a long period of immunity destruction of fellow eye from sympathetic disease. Flo. 5.—Foreign bodv in lens, commencing purulent inhltration of eye. Septic in- fection must have taken place at accident, as foreign bodies are usually well tolerated in this situation. Fig. ().—Piece of metal stuck fast in lower part of ciliary body, a common situation which is reached by a rebound from the back of the eye. These Figures are from drawings by Dr. W. E. Fothergill of specimens in the possession of the autlior, and enlarged to two diametei>..

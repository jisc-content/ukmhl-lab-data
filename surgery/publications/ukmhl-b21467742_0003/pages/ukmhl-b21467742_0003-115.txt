99 EMBRYOLOGY, HUMAN bourhood of the stomach, and these are con- nected with a plexus formed from fibres from the vagus nerves. In the cervical region a |)lexus is being formed, composed of ganglia of cells which have wandered from the cell column and of fibres closely related with the descending branches of the vagus. In the brain, changes are manifest. A longi- as the rudiment of the cerebellum. Out of the alar and basal laminae are formed the rudiments of the pons and medulla; the attachments of the roof-plate or velum to the alar luminfe is marked by the obex and ligula, which are thickenings on the margins of the lower angle of the fourth ventricle. The rudiment of the restiform body is found in the upper margin of \ Fro. 17.â€”Embryo of the fiftli week. Enlarged 15 times. Embryo Pr. (After His.) tudinal ridge-like thickening appears in the roof or dorsal wall of the mid-hrain vesicle or mesen- cephalon ; later, in the ninth week, this is replaced by a furrow, at the sides of which are developed the corpora quadrigemina, but as yet tliere is no trace of these bodies. In the hind- hmiii or rhombencephalon, further developments are visible now both in the floor and in the roof. The roof-plate is wide and thin ; over the posterior half of the fourth ventricle it forms the inferior medullary velum, while over the anterior half the superior medullary velum develops as well the alar lamina. If wo now look at the parts in front of the mesencephalon, we find that the roof-j^late of the diencej)ka/o)i or inter-brain is thin-walled and somewhat folded, while in tlie floor-plate is a well marked ventral groove ; the lateral walls are divided into dorsal and ventral zones by the grooves known as the sulci of Monro, which extend forward towards the point of origin of the optic evaginations. At the posterior end of the folded roof-plate is an eleva- tion which later becomes a hollow^ evagination, the pineal process, and still later the pineal body

FILAKIASIS 290 when the parasite gains access to the duck, which infects itself by feeding on Daphnia. Filaria Mazzantii, Eailhet, 1891.—Only the female worm is known, having being fomid beneath the skin of the pigeon, the blood of which contained the embryos. Viviparous. Filaria dava, Wedl, 1856.—Found by Miiller in the peritracheal connective tissue of the domestic pigeon. Filaria Man&oni, Cobbold, 1879.—Found by Manson at Amoy, China, in the eye of the domestic chicken. Magalhaes (1895) found it also in Brazil in chickens and peacocks. Filaria anatis, Rudolphi, 1809.—Found by Paullinus about the heart of a duck. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.—Besides the filarise referred to in the text, a large number are further found in mammalia, birds, reptiles, amphibia, fish, mollusca, insects, myriapods, and Crustacea, as will be seen by referring to the monograph of Stossisch, who gives a very extensive list of the filarite (212 !), their hosts, and references to the bibliography. In the above article I have made free use of Railliet's excellent work (adopting his nomenclature), as also of the writings of Manson. In both of these writers' publications will be found references to the literature. A bibliography will be found in a publication of the writer's given below. See also the contributions of British authors of late years in the British Medical Journal and Lancet, and also refer to the Centralblatt far Bakteriologie unci Parasitenkunde. It is impossible in the limit of space allowed to include a bibliography of so extensive a subject, but subjoined are some of the more important references to the recent literature ; the rest are to be found in the books of reference or those above men- tioned.

File-cutters' Disease. See Trades, Dangerous {Lead Poisoning). Fiiicin.—The active principle of the root of Aspidium filix mas. See FiLix Mas. Filiform.—Threadlike, e.g. the filiform papiHa; of the tongue. See Physiology, Diges- tion {Mouth, Tongue). Filix Mas.—^The rhizome of Aspidium Filix mas, the male fern. It contains an oleo- resin and an active principle, Fihcic Acid, which can be isolated as a white amorphous powder. Preparation — Extractum FiUcis Liquidum. Dose — 45 to 90 m. The liquid extract is employed as an anthelmintic for all varieties of tape-worm. It has a disagreeable taste, and on account of its irritating qualities it is often vomited soon after being taken. Doses of from 1-2 3 are recommended, given in emulsion with acacia or tragacanth and flavoured with ginger. The prescription should not include water, as this precipitates the oleo-resin. The stomach and intestines must be emptied as far as possible beforehand by fasting and purgatives ; and the dose is to be followed after some hours by another brisk purge to carry away the dead worm. An admirable method of administration is by capsule in doses of 15 m. repeated every half hour until the desired amount has been given. Success cannot be claimed until the head of the worm has been found in the motions. Male fern has been used also with some success for the destruction of Ankylostoma duodenale. Fillet.—The word fillet is used in three senses in Aledicine : (1) a bandage, such as that put round the arm before the operation of bleeding from a vein was undertaken (to "fill it," i.e. the vein); (2) an obstetrical snare or bandage to make traction on the foetus in delayed labours; (3) a part of the brain.

Fimbria. — A fringe or border, e.g. the fimbricC of the abdominal end of the Fallopian tube. See Fallopian Tubes {Structure); Generation, Female Organs op {Fallopian Tubes). Fingfers. 1.

MILITARY SURGERY. 118 the musket-bullet occasions concussion of the brain, without lacerating the integuments. The bullet struck upon the left parietal bone, and the soldier fell instantly senseless to the earth. You find slight puffing up of the skin, with a little discolouration, but no other ex- ternal signs of injury. The general symptoms are those of well-marked concussion. Treatment. Instantly cut and shave off the patient's hair. Mix ten grains of calomel with a little larcl or butter; attach it to the end of a quill, introduce it into the pharynx, and leave it there. Apply on very thin old linen cold evaporating lotion, such as F. 26. Raise the patient's head a little, and support it laterally, so that it may not roll about. Place him in a dark situation, watch him, and let him alone. When reaction is really manifest, bleed and purge him. This constitutes the primary treatment. Case XXXV.â€”Gun-shot Wound on the Back Part of the Head. Here the bullet penetrated to the external table, near the occipital protuberance, and you can with the finger feel it lying upon the bone. The patient has in great measure recovered from the first shock, and complains only of slight pain and uneasiness.

MILITARY SURGERY. 142 the femur is broken by a musket-ball. The shot passed through the limb at the junction of the middle with the lower third, and the thigh-bone is crushed. Pass the little finger into the posterior wound, and you find it coated with granules of cancelli. Amputation is the only remedy. Perform it as described at Case XX. Case LI1I. — Gun-shot Wound of the Condyles of the Femur. When, as in the case before us, a musket-ball has passed through the condyles of the thigh-bone, terribly comminuting it, according to a good old rule we ought to cut off the limb. This is doubtless a sound axiom; it is the safer course. There remains, however, another method by which life may be saved, and the limb ren- dered useful to the patient,—that is, by excising the extremity of the bone, by sawing off the broken condyles. In our example, the shot struck upon the external condyle of the left thigh-bone, passed clean through, splitting both condyles into the knee-joint.* Now it must be apparent even to the tyro, that such a condi- tion of this important joint admits not of reparation. He would probably instantly amputate the limb. I, however, propose to extirpate the fractured condyles, * I have not performed the operation here spoken of, but I fully propose doing so the first opportunity. Amputation was done in the case above.

RETENTION OP URINE. 211 and a dose of calomel and opium in a great measure prevent their recurrence. RETENTION OF URINE. It is not my purpose at present to treat of the various forms of retention so common amongst soldiers, but it is necessary to notice that kind which is the result of neglect to evacuate the bladder at the first demand. During forced marches, or in the hurry and excitement of battle, men will not, or cannot, stop to micturate. The consequence is, the bladder gets so much distended, that it cannot contract upon its contents; it becomes paralysed, and the patient at his utmost effort fails to void his urine. When immediately called to a case such as this, you introduce a catheter, draw off the urine, and the functions of the viscus are restored, without any fear remaining of future mischief. If, on the other hand, the patient does not, or cannot, in- stantly apply for aid, the bladder becomes more and more distended, until at length, being stretched to the utmost, and, as it were, ready to burst,* the urine is forced through the urethra in spite of all obstruction, and dribbles away. But it only dribbles, passes off as fast as secreted, and nothing more. The bladder re- mains distended as before, and the patient as impotent * I have never seen a case of ruptured bladder from disten- sion only. J question if the undiseased bladder ever bursts.

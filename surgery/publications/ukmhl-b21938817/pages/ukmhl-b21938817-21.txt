B MILITAET SUE GEE Y. PEELIMINAET OBSEEVATIONS. Military Surgery, viewed as a science, differs not from surgery in general. It is governed by the same laws, founded on the same principles, and admits only of the term " military surgery" in contradistinc- tion to surgery, inasmuch as it differs somewhat in practice; namely, in the first place, it is more difficult, and less certain in its effects,â€”being practised under less favourable circumstances. It requires, par excel- lence, promptitude and decision. Moreover, courage of the highest order is essential to it: on the one hand, to render the surgeon superior to scenes of horror and disgust; on the other, to keep him steady and collected under personal danger. Again : it differs in regard to treatment j not, indeed, greatly in a therapeutical point of view, but in the application of means to ends.

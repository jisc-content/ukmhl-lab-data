They are of all degrees of severity, from the instantaneously fatal, to those from which (after a short period of stupor) the soldier soon permanently recovers. They are occasioned by spent- shot of all kinds and sizes, by blows of the sword or clubbed musket, and by falling from horseback. Con- siderable numbers of men are killed in every battle by simple concussion of the brain, and we have failed to find any external signs of injury; commonly the nature of the lesion is sufficiently clear, and the deep-seated mischief may be fairly judged of by the same.

I do not consider amputation of the leg, as near the ankle-joint as it can be performed, either a very safe or desirable operation. It is a customary one, however, and easy. Nevertheless, it leaves a long inconvenient stump, and is oftentimes attended with real danger. The operation is very simple. Apply a tourniquet. Grasp the left hand over the spot where you propose to divide the bones. Make a clean circular incision through the integuments. Draw back the skin an inch and a half, and with one firm annular cut lay bare the bones. By means of a small catlin divide remaining soft parts, and apply the saw.

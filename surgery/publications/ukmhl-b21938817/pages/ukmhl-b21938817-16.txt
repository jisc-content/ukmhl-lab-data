vm PREFACE. battle of Soorajkoond,—in the second siege of Mooltan ; also the whole of the enemy's wounded found within the city, and great part of those in the fort; together with the wounded in the siege of Luckkie, and nume- rous casualties necessarily happening in so large a force,—passed through my hands. There were cases of every degree of severity, kind, and description, presenting on the whole an ample field for observation, and affording matter sufficient, perhaps, for a considerable work, comprehending the whole subject of primary and subsequent treatment of wounds, with a full description of the operative part, which in my case, having neither health to write, nor money to spare for printing, I have been compelled only to touch upon, or wholly leave out. 14, Babk Place, Bayswatek.

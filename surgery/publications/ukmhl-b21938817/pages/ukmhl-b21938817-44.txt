24 MILITARY SURGERY. great majority of cases death is the result, still there remains much for the surgeon to do, and many come within his powers of restoration. When the chest has been perforated by a ball, extreme collapse is the immediate consequence. The natural temperature of the body speedily falls; the pulse sinks, and becomes lost; the face pourtrays great distress ; respiration becomes more and more laborious; and dissolution quickly ends the painful scene. If the heart or great vessels be implicated, death is inevitable. When both lungs are shot through, and the missile passes near their roots, little time remains to the poor soldier. When one lung is traversed, and distressing dyspnoea is accompanied with copious haemorrhage, the patient's days are few ; and when the case is but rela- tively slight, the bullet passing through an apex of a lung, and out, without injury even to bone, he has not, perhaps, many days to live, as inflammation and its consequences may perchance follow,â€”leaving the indi- vidual scarcely a chance of recovery. To all of these, however, (omitting one,) exceptions are not uncommon ; and we happily witness perfect restoration to health from wounds whose first aspect gave no room to hope. When both lungs are traversed, and the patient does not immediately die, our most energetic measures are to be used in arresting haemorrhage, which is most often fearful; to relieve the distressing respiration, and to maintain the natural warmth and powers of the system.

33 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. unfavourable concomitants, often fatal to the welfare of the cases, and always difficult to deal with. They must be met with the most active and approved measures for their removal. They may be called trau- matic,â€”not that they differed in any way from ordinary forms of these diseases, but that they were solely attendant upon wounds. I lost several patients from these causes during the war, and that, too, when there was scarcely a simple case of dysentery or diarrhoea in the whole force under my charge. It will be remembered we mentioned that cannon- shot wounds of the extremities were more noxious to life in an inverse ratio to the velocity and impetus of the shot. Those remarks will not apply to musket and pistol-ball wounds. It is apparent, in these cases, that according to the velocity and momentum of this small missile so will the amount of danger and severity be. It is not easy to estimate the amount of force necessary to propel a bullet directly through a limb, so that the apertures may be diametrically opposed to each other. Neither can we lay down any rule by which to de- termine the severity of a wound by the distance from whence the bullet is discharged ; this must necessarily be much modified by the kind of firearm used, by the size of the ball, the length of the barrel, and the charge of powder. We may, however, by way of example, suppose that a musket-bullet discharged at the distance of a hundred yards passes clean through the thigh, fracturing and comminuting the femur ; at three D

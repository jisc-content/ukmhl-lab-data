CANNON-SHOT WOUNDS. LACERATIONS. 91 life, and to give time for the administration of stimuli, m order to render the poor sufferer able to bear neces- sary amputation,—will any thinking man again give chloroform ? (We say again, for it has been too often given in similar cases.) We think—we hope not. Common sense will surely teach us better, and, not- withstanding the many plausible reasons in favour of chloroform, prevent us from committing an error which has hastened many a fellow-being to the grave. Case XV.—Cannon-shot Wound—Laceration on the External Aspect of the Thigh, with slight Injury to Bone. This case presents a very extensive lacerated surface, and is on that account interesting. It serves to show that our prognosis may be favourable in some cases, provided bone be uninjured, or only slightly touched, no matter how extensive the flesh wound may be. In the example before us, a six-pound shot im- pinged upon the right trochanter major, and chipped off a piece of that process, passed down the thigh, and escaped just between the patella and head of the fibula. Throughout the course of the ball, the skin, fasciae, and muscles are torn to pieces.

PUNCTURED WOUNDS. 169 wound. But 1 must entreat my younger brethren to think before they act; and I take this opportunity of assuring my friend that a wound of the popliteal artery is a very serious business,â€”so are wounds of arteries generally, and the treatment of them a serious business too. Pressure judiciously applied is un- doubtedly a very efficient means of arresting haemorr- hage, and I can truly say I have succeeded beyond my expectations in checking bleeding by it. But he is wholly wrong in thinking it will answer in every case, as he will assuredly find when called upon to act on the field of battle. But, to return to our example, which we find to be a wound of the popliteal artery, indicated by profuse discharge of florid blood from a wound in the popliteal space. Treatment. Speedily apply a tourniquet over the femoral artery, and screw it tight enough not only to stop the flow of arterial blood, but also to prevent the return of venous blood by the femoral vein. Now carefully notice whether venous blood escapes also, and in sufficient quantity to indicate a wound of the popliteal vein. If there be sufficient reason to conclude that both artery and vein are wounded, then you must amputate the limb, as shewn at Case XX. If, on the contrary, the artery alone be injured, then ligature of the femoral artery is the proper course.

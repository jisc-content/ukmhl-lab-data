8 MILITARY SURGERY. Why some wounds bleed, and others do not, is by no means easily accounted for. Sometimes wounds of the upper extremities bleed more than those of the lower, and vice versa. At one time, you meet with considerable haemorrhage where you have reason not to expect it. At another, you find none where, accord- ing to the rules laid down by authors, it ought to be. All that has been said with respect to the contraction and retraction of lacerated arteries is correct, inasmuch as, other things being equal, they do contract and retract to the saving of many a life. But whether haemorrhage will or will not follow a gun-shot wound mainly depends on the amount of physical prostration and collapse produced by the violent shock to the general system, or rather to the heart and vascular system, which are chiefly affected in all such cases; syncope following as a consequence of insufficient supply of blood to the brain. It should be remembered that the fainting and collapse we now speak of differ widely from those forms of stupor and insensibility which follow imme- diate violence to the head. The former depend on arrest of the circulation, the latter on a shock to the brain and nervous system itself. In the first example, little is to be feared when reaction takes place ; in the second, inflammation and its consequences are to be guarded against. Of course the treatment differs as widely as the diseases themselves, and too much care cannot be taken in distinguishing them. When direct violence to the cranium accompanies serious

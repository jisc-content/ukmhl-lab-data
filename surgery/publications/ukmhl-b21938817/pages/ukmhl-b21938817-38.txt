MILITARY SURGERY. IS CHAPTER II. The lesser kinds of gun-shot wounds now remain to be treated of; and they are those of grape-shot, musket and pistol bullets. It is not necessary, however, to speak of these separately, further than to call attention to the different size of the balls. The difference in the size of the bullet, however, does not always in any great degree increase the danger of the wound, for the pistol-ball is as fatal within its range as that of the musket, or the single grape-shot itself. When many grape-shot strike the same individual, death is the im- mediate consequence. When they impinge upon a limb, the case falls under the head Cannon-shot injuries. When one single grape strikes, (although the wound may be somewhat larger,) it differs not from that of the musket or pistol ball; so we may treat of these under one denomination, and proceed to speak of those which befall the head. The slightest kind of injury of this nature is that in which the ball merely strikes the cranium without raising the skin. Occasionally, how- ever, as with the round shot, subintegumental inflam- mation, with itsconsequences,follows. In those instances where the soft parts are torn, the wound is of the bruised and lacerated character, and the bone may be

r.UN-SHOT WOUNDS. 148 and to save the limb, with, of course, the sacrifice of the knee-joint. Operation. Place the patient on his back upon a firm table, with the wounded limb projecting. Let him be well sup- ported with pillows, and steadily held by assistants. Place yourself on the patient's right, and place the knee to be operated on, with the leg stretched out, in the most favourable position. Now (all things being ready), with a largest size scalpel make an incision, beginning three inches above the joint, on the inner side, exactly opposite to the shaft of the bone ; carry it downwards over the internal condyle, outwards across the ligamentum patellae (which must be divided), over the external condyle, and upwards to a spot three inches above the joint on the outer aspect. Dissect back and reflect the skin, patella, and the origins of the vasti and crureus muscles. Next flex the knee, and divide the lateral ligaments of the joint. Now cut through the crucial ligaments, press back the head of the tibia into the ham, and carefully detach the origins of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and popliteus muscles, keep- ing the edge of the knife towards the bone. Lastly, pressing back the tibia still further, carry a broad spa- tula behind the femur, just above the condyles, to guard the artery and all soft parts, and saw off the condyles as high up as the nature of the fracture may require. It will be necessary to remove the patella, and to apply a few ligatures; the fewer the better. The

130 MILITARY SURGERY. In wounds of the lungs, liver, and spleen, our primary indication is to wrest the patient from the immediate hand of death. In those of the kidney, intestines, and bladder, we concentrate our forces against inordi- nate inflammation and its effects. My first case presents a good example of wounds of the abdomen wherein the bullet passes clean through the belly from side to side. The symptoms are, in brief, severe pain * collapse, anxiety, and great mental alarm. The prognosis is very unfavourable, the diagnosis uncertain, as to injury of intestines ; the treatment uniformly the same. Treatment. Before all things it is necessary to place the patient in an easy position upon his back, with his head and shoulders raised, his thighs drawn up, and supported with pillows in order to relax the recti abdominis muscles. Introduce the little finger into each wound, and ascertain if there be any extraneous matter in them ; if there be, remove it with a common dressing forceps. Cover up the wounds with moist lint and oiled silk, and when pain is very great pass a broad bandage round the body : it will give great relief. As the collapse is very alarming, you must do something for its relief. Do not, however, on any account give stimuli by the mouth. You may place a mustard- poultice, or lint dipped in turpentine, to the scrobiculus * Not by any means a constant accompaniment.

88 MILITARY SURGERY. We shall, however, briefly state our views regarding the flap and circular operations. We had thought much of them before entering on the bloody plains of India; we had assured ourselves of that which was best; but practice materially altered our notions. Our opinions were modified, in some respects changed— changed, perhaps, for the better, and remain as fol- lows, viz.:— Generally speaking, when one bone only is to be sawed through, the anteroposterior or the bilateral flap operation is most eligible. Of these two, the former is generally preferable, inasmuch as the flaps are, for the most part, more equal, and the cicatrices less pressed upon by the wooden leg during progres- sion. If two bones be implicated—such as the radius and ulna, or the tibia and fibula,—then, undoubtedly, the old circular operation is preferable as a rule, and we commonly practise it. There are exceptions, however, in many special cases, as we shall by and by fully point out. But we must not neglect to state en pas- sant, as a powerful objection—thai all circular ampu- tations are much more painful than flap, and that they cannot be performed so quickly,—not even when done in haste ; but haste should never be used : no opera- tion on the human body admits of haste. Smartness is most desirable. The military surgeon cannot be too smart in his manipulations : it renders him superior to many of his colleagues, and merciful to his patient.

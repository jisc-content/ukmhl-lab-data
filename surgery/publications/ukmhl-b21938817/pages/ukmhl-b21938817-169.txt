GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 149 Case LV1I.—Gun-shot Wound of the Ankle-joint. We find this wound running obliquely through the joint, from within outwards ; and we notice synovia, mixed with blood and small particles of bone, oozing from it. The ball struck just above the internal mal- leolus, and escaped at the point of the external one. There is no apparent displacement; no abnormal ap- pearance about the joint, with the exception of the wound. The slightest manipulation, however, affords evidence of fracture, and the presence of comminuted bone in the joint. The patient can scarcely bear the least motion of the foot; he evinces the greatest dread of your gentlest touch. Your course is palpably clear. Administer a strong opiate, viz.— R Tr. Opii, T)ixl. Tr. Hyoscyami, rnxx. Spt. iEther. Nit. 3SS. Mist. Camphorse, gij. and proceed to amputate the leg after the manner de- scribed at Case XXIV.* * The late Lieut. Christopher, I. N., was wounded exactly in the manner described above. I saw him on the instant, but did not instantly determine to operate, which I should have done. Influenced partly by the feelings of the patient, the hopes of his friends, and my own anxiety to save the leg of a very valued friend, I weakly resolved to wait. Ten days after the leg was amputated, the patient being under the influence of chloroform, and he died.

26 MILITARY SURGERY. The external position of the wound, or wounds, will not often, or perhaps ever, give us a correct idea of the course the ball has taken in traversing the thoracic cavity. For example, the bullet enters at the upper part of the chest on the left side, and the right lung is wounded at its base. Or, perchance, the ball goes in just above the diaphragm on the right, and escapes just below the clavicle on the left. Indeed, the musket, rifle, or pistol bullet, except when discharged close to its victim, seldom takes a direct course through a.cavity. So it is that the aperture of egress bears no relation to that of ingress. No rule, consequently, can be laid down, with a view to the finding of these extraneous bodies. It is a matter, however, of comparatively small importance, as the mere extraction of the ball should not even be thought of as long as symptoms fraught with instant danger to life remain unrelieved. It will be seen, (when we speak of treatment,) that the practice of probing and searching for bullets is by no means desirable, and that it is in all truth the last curative measure to be adopted. We have before noticed, and shall again and again have occasion to recur to, the extraordinary routes balls take in their passage through living tissues ; sometimes flying off at right angles, at others taking a semicircular course, now and then making a complete circle, and often following a zig-zag direction. When we meet with cases such as these, it is not by any means easy to say how they happen. The sharp edge or angle of a bone,â€”the tough smooth

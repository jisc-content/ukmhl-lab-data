CANNON-SHOT WOUNDS. 87 necessity make a few general remarks on lacerated wounds of the limbs. There are one or two principles applicable to every case, which can never with propriety be lost sight of j and the most important of all are these,—viz. i 1st, To save life; 2d, To save a limb ; 3d, To render that limb serviceable to the patient. In order to attain these desirable ends, lose not an instant in carrying out your measures. Wait no longer than Nature herself demands : be your decision what it may, let not an idle moment pass. If you must needs take off a limb, do it at once. (I mean, of course, when the patient is in a fit condition.) Notwithstanding some objections, on the whole primary operation is best : I believe I know it to be such, and therefore unhesitatingly set it clown as a rule. There can be little doubt, taking all things fairly into consideration, that amputation immediately after injury is best; and we may without fear assert it. We cannot, however, so easily or so safely assert which mode of operating is best; neither is it easy to say which is (under all conditions) the most eligible man- ner of taking off a limb. We shall not attempt (seeing how conflicting opi- nions are) to convince our younger brethren. We ourselves take a middle course,—in medio tutissimus, — they can follow; or, on the one hand, adhere to the old mode, or, on the other, prefer and practise the comparatively new.

MILITARY SURGERY. 102 now on the score of retraction of muscles. Ac- cordingly, perform the flap-operation. The anteropos- terior is best. It should be done near the knee ; but the tendon of the rectus femoris muscle in front, and that of the semi- membranosus and tendinosus behind, must not be in- cluded in the flaps. Operation. Apply a tourniquet. Grasp the thigh with both hands, in order to ascertain its circumference. The limb being twenty inches round, make the flaps four inches in length. Pinch up the muscles in front of the thigh, thrust in the knife, and boldly transfix the limb anterior and close to the femur. The instant the point of the in- strument protrudes, carry it firmly forwards, and out at a spot already marked with the eye. Reflect the flap, and cut out the posterior after the same manner, without again perforating the skin. Turn back this flap also, and with one rapid sweep of the knife divide all remaining soft parts down to the bone, to which apply the saw in a horizontal line, and cut it steadily through. Tie the femoral artery, and three small branches ; sponge out coagula ; bring the flaps into close appo- sition ; insert five sutures ; put on one broad circular strip of plaster, and three strips from before backwards; apply a bandage, and keep it moist.

The reader has doubtless heard it said,—" Poor was killed by a stab of the bayonet in the groin." He was, in fact, killed by a punctured wound of the femoral artery just below Poupart's ligament. Many soldiers die of such wounds in every general action. There is, alas ! no hope of saving them, as the medical officer is nowhere at hand.

Now make a curved incision four inches in length, half an inch above and in the course of Poupart's ligament, and cut down to the tendon of the external oblique muscle. Divide this tendon to the same extent, * If there be sufficient room, of course the femoral vesael must be tied above and below the wound. To tie the external iliac is the last resource.

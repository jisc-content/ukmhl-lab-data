148 MILITARY SURGERY. rest must be enjoined; the patient placed in a dark situation, and kept low. A draught, should be given every six hours, and the mixture, F. 18, as often as needs be, to allay thirst.* Case LVL—Gun-shot Wound of the Leg, above the Ankle. Here the tibia and fibula are so severely comminuted, that it would be idle to attempt to save the limb ■ therefore let amputation be performed, as shown at Case XXIII. We give this case to show that, when both bones are comminuted, amputation must be performed. * During the siege of Mooltan, one morning in going round, accompanied by Lieut. Pollock, my attention was drawn to a case of musket-bullet wound of the leg. The baU entered on the inner, side of the calf, and passed slightly upwards and out- wards. The limb had been tightly tied up, and was somewhat swoUeu. I introduced my finger into the wound, and readily discovered the ball lying near the fibula behind. It not being convenient to extract it at that moment, I turned to another case, but had scarcely commenced enquiries, when Pollock said, " Doctor! that man seems to be bleeding a good deal." I looked up, and, to my surprise, saw blood flowing from the wound in a florid stream. I instantly passed my finger into it, affixed a tourniquet, drew out the bullet, applied compresses, and a bandage from the toes upwards. Hemorrhage was effectually and completely restrained. This man recovered without any additional operation.

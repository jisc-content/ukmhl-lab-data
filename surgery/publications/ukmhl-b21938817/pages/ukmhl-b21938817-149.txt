129 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. the treatment must be the same. The diagnosis is not always so clear, but the symptoms of haemorrhage cannot often be mistaken or overlooked. Case XLV.—Gun-shot Wound of the Kidney. Here we have also an exceedingly dangerous wound. Its situation, direction, and depth, together with the presence of bloody urine, are conclusive evidence of the nature of the injury. Treatment. Full and copious bleeding, in order to restrain hae- morrhage • digitalis, hemlock, and henbane, to diminish the heart's action • calomel, opium, purgatives, low diet, and profound rest, to keep off inflammation, and, if possible, prevent destructive suppuration and sloughing. Small quantities only of acidulated barley- or gum- water should be allowed for the first two days. Examine the state of the bladder often, and introduce a catheter on the least appearance of retention of urine. Case XLVI.—Gun-shot Wounds of the Intestines. Again we have a highly dangerous class of injuries; not, indeed, so instantaneously destructive of life as many of the foregoing, but more fatal than they in their subsequent effects. K

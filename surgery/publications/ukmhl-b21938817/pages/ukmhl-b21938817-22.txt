Thus it happens, that Military Surgery, or, more properly. speaking, Field Practice, is more or less governed by fortuitous circumstances, which will con- tinue—notwithstanding the best arrangements—to exert some influence over it. It will be well for the young surgeon to remember this, and to be above its effects. Again : Field Surgery differs inasmuch as it presents cases seldom met with, except upon the field. And the inquiring surgeon has ample opportunities of estimating the comparative merits of primary and secondary operating, by witnessing the infliction of those wounds which it is his immediate care to heal.

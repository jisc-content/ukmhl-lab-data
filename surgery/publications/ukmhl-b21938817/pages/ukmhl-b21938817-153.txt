133 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. is better at once to perform the following operation, viz. :â€”To open the bladder, as in the high operation for stone. I do not by any means recommend this operation in case of calculus in the bladder : I never perform that operation, even when I know the stone to be very large : but, already having an opening in the upper part of the bladder, I without doubt consider it proper to cut down upon that viscus above the pubis, and if possible extract the bullet through the hole that itself has made. Place the patient on his back upon a firm table, raise his head and shoulders in order slightly to relax the abdominal muscles. Introduce a full-sized sound into the bladder, depress the handle, and carry its point upwards behind the pubis to that portion of the bladder which is uncovered by peritonaeum. Press it gently on that spot, and let it be held steadily in position. Now make an incision three inches long in the median line, and dissect down to the bladder, following, if possible, the course of the wound. Having reached the bladder, pass a straight sound downwards, in order to ascertain the exact position of the ball. Lastly, introduce the forceps and remove it. A gum-elastic catheter must be worn in the bladder, and the urine allowed to dribble away. Every precaution should be taken against extravasation, inflammation, and the for- mation of abscess. I need hardly say that, if the wound in the bladder cannot be readily found, an opening must be made into it at that spot where it is uncovered by peritoneum.

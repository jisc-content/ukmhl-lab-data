GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 29 stomachs have been shot through from before to behind. We must not, however, forget what has repeatedly been said as to the aptitude of balls to pass from the direct course. It is possible for a bullet to pass in at the scrobiculus cordis, and out again at the back, without being fatal. It is not only possible, but by no means uncommon, for wounds of the colon to heal completely; but bullet wounds of the jejunum or ilium are ninety- nine times in a hundred mortal. In those solitary instances of recovery where no external opening re- mains, we are apt to doubt the intestine ever having been wounded. Where a fistulous opening remains connected, with the bowel, it can scarcely be called a recovery ; although life (hardly desirable) is still the unhappy patient's. Military surgeons nevertheless tell you that recovery is not uncommon, and they will give you unquestionable examples. As long as there is life we should hope, and fail not to use those palliative means which are clearly pointed out. We must not, however, forget that much meddling will assuredly prove fatal here; and therefore it is better not to inter- fere, but leave the case to nature. She will sometimes cure where art can only kill. Occasionally a ball passes through the belly without injury to its contents. Sometimes it sweeps round the abdomen without wounding the intestines or peritoneum; at others (especially in very fat persons), the shot perforates the integuments and adipose tissue only, remaining im- bedded therein, or, traversing it for some distance, escapes without doing further mischief. It may, how-

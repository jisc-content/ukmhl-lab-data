GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 17 bring them about. Inflammation of the peritoneum, or intestitis, may follow, or an abscess form under- neath the integuments. These are consequently to be guarded against; and when they appear, should be met with as active treatment as the patient can possibly bear, as they often run high, and give con- siderable trouble. Contused wounds of the extremities not being immediately dangerous to life, most frequently come under the notice of the surgeon. Of course, their importance and severity will depend upon the amount of violence applied, and more particularly on the nature of the structures injured. When the elbow, knee, or ankle-joint is concerned, the accident must be con- sidered a most serious one. Due care is to be taken in ascertaining the presence of fracture ; and too much care cannot be used in the treatment of the case. When the knee-joint is the seat of mischief, together with painful local symptoms, the constitutional will be for the most part severe. In restoring the circulation and warmth of the system, it must be remembered that stimuli of all kinds will have an unfavourable effect on the local disease-.: this is to be provided against, if possible. Sometimes, when a fragment of a shell, especially if large, falls upon the fleshy portion of a limb, very extensive extravasation of blood, with great swelling, follows â–  and, if the subjacent bone be also bruised,' the case is a bad one : if not, the prognosis will be favourable, although much swelling and ecchymosis remain for a considerable period.

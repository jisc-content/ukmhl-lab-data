CANNON-SHOT WOUNDS. 85 up." The accident occurred four clays ago, conse- quently suppuration is progressing, and there is a free discharge. The fragment of shell in its course touched the pubis, and cut clean through the scrotum, avoiding the penis and right testicle, but wounding and bruising severely the left. Both cords are uninjured. The missile, lastly, deeply lacerated the perinaeuni, keeping to the left of the median line, avoiding the anus, knocking off a small portion of the tuberosity of the left ischium, and escaped. Together with suppuration there is necessarily some disposition to slough; and the left testicle itself is inclined to take on that condition. Be not in a hurry to remove these sloughs, but rather dress the whole sore with the bark ointment; place the patient on his back with his legs drawn up, as in the operation of lithotomy, and let the dead tissues come away of themselves. In no case cut off an injured testicle. Do not, indeed, excise any recently injured structures; they protect the uninjured parts, and act as coverings to them. After due time all dead matter is thrown off, or may be detached without force or the use of the knife. A small portion of the ischium will exfoliate, and must be removed by the forceps when it becomes loose. The patient's strength must be attended to, and support given if there be inordinate suppuration. Sutures are not admissible.

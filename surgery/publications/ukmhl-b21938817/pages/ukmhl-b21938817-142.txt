MILITARY SUUGEitY. 122 pean soldier, watching the effects of our cannon-slioL upon the walls of Mooltan, when a bullet came in, and struck my comrade in the neck on the left side, divided the carotid artery, and passed downwards towards the chest. The soldier falls prostrate on the floor, crying, " Good-bye, my friends !" There is fearful haemorrhage. Lose not a moment; stand not an instant uncertain what to do. Throw yourself down by the patient; place your thumb upon the vessel as it ascends behind the clavicle. Make pressure backwards and a little inwards, and keep it up until bleeding has wholly ceased, and the vessel secured. The common carotid can be easily commanded by pressure of the thumb. It is not, however, an easy matter to apply a compress with the same effect, and to enable the patient to be sent to the rear. In all probability he will die of hcemorrhage on the way. The only safe plan is to tie the divided vessel, above and below, immediately and upon the spot. Operation. Place the patient on his back. Slightly raise his shoulders. Throw back the head, and turn the face to the opposite side. Now make an incision, two inches and a half in length, directly across the wound, in the course of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus, and divide skin, platysma myoides, and fascia. The edge of the scalpel may now be dispensed with, and the handle only used in turning aside veins, nerves, and cellular tissue, until the divided artery be brought

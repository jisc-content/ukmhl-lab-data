GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 5 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. The five former kinds of injuries are comprehended under the head Gun-shoL wounds; but it is fit to consider them severally, according to their degree of severity. Cannon-ball wounds, therefore, peremptorily claim our earliest attention, inasmuch as they are pre- eminently the most violent and fatal. The cannon-shot is generally more destructive even than the exploding shell, because its range and mo- mentum are much greater. For the first five or six hundred yards, it grinds to powder and destroys everything that opposes its hissing course. For as many more, its progress is little less terrible: it tears its way through everything tearable, and at length expends its fury in the earth, or, in long and angry bounds, exhausts its strength, and finally rolls to your feet, apparently a harmless thing. To the last, how- ever, it is most dangerous to approach the moving round-shot: and we have ourselves amputated limbs which had been smashed to pieces by balls that, to all appearance, were incapable of injuring the uncovered foot.* * Before Mooltan, I removed a boy's limb (sat. 10) near the hip-joint. He was struck by a six-pounder close to our tents. He declared he thought the shot had stopped, and ran to pick it up. This wound was situate so near the groin, and bled so freely, that I thought fit to amputate upon the spot. The patient speedily and effectually recovered.

22 MILITARY SURGERY. vertebra is fractured, and the patient does not long survive wounds of the carotids and internal jugular veins 3 but a soldier, horse, or any other animal, often drops dead without a struggle when shot through the neck, although there may be no bleeding, and evidently no injury to the spinal marrow.* Wounds of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and oesophagus, are generally mortal sooner or later; and injuries of the carotids are for the most part so : but haemorrhage may be arrested, and the patient's life saved, by the timely assistance of the surgeon* and the deformities and contractions that are wont to follow may be in great part prevented by his judicious care. Beyond this there is comparatively little to be done. It occasionally happens that exfoliation of bone follows gun-shot wounds of the neck, (as, indeed, is the case in all parts where bones are concerned,) from the ball having injured one or more of the processes which proceed from the lower cervical vertebrae. They are troublesome cases ; seldom recover without the loss of the power of motion, and often terminate fatally * We have ourselves killed a tiger of the largest size, with a single ball, in the manner spoken of. In this case there was slight venous hemorrhage only. We killed, also, a large wolf in^the same way. In both cases the animal did not move a limb after being shot. The tiger will often require a dozen or more bullets to bring him down; and he does not, even then, immediately die. We have seen one fight desperately after having been shot through the heart.

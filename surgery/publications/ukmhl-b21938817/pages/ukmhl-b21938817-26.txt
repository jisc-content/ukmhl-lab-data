MILITARY SURGERY. 6 Eor the first and second part of its course the deadly round-shot (meeting with no inanimate obstruc- tion) kills upon the spot any unhappy individual with whose head or trunk it comes in contact, and to the end of its flight it is much the same; but the soldier does now and then recover after having received a cannon-ball full in the face, chest, or abdomen, as we shall hereafter see. When the cannon-ball at the height of its velocity strikes full upon a limb, that limb is in effect carried away, and amputation of the stump is obviously inevitable. In all cases, no question can arise in the surgeon's mind as to the propriety of operating; his course is palpably clear. The appearance of a wound of this nature is gene- rally much as follows:—If a European's, the skin looks more or less livid. If an Indian's, blacker than natural. The tissues are torn through, and hang down in shreds. Small portions of the muscles, veins, arteries, and other structures, come away when you pinch them Avith the finger and thumb; and the exposed surface of the truncated bone is almost ground to powder. In fact, all structures, for a short dis- tance above the actual injury, may be said to be physiologically dead. There may be no haemorrhage. It is, however, wrong to suppose that bleeding does not follow these wounds,—wrong to suppose that much bleeding does not follow; for, in truth, in many cases, considerable haemorrhage takes place, and many a valuable life is lost from this very cause.

PUNCTURED WOUNDS. 30 which death itself alone relieves. If the cavity of the chest alone be entered, without any damage to its viscera, dissolution is often no less sure,—air rushing in, sometimes fills the pleural cavity, putting a period to the process of respiration, and death by asphyxia is the result. In the great majority of these cases the prognosis must needs be extremely unfavourable, and we are compelled to be guarded in our conclusions respecting the whole of them. If, perchance, the neck be thrust through, it becomes the surgeon's duty (before he determines on his course,) to ascertain, as far as may be, what structures are impli- cated : his prognosis will be regulated accordingly. Much manipulation or meddling in any way will assuredly prove detrimental, whether the wound be in the neck, chest, or belly; so, therefore, it must he guarded against, and the strictest quietude enjoined. There are living examples of recovery from the severest kinds of punctures, even from wounds of the abdomen, the intestines themselves being perforated and torn ; but, alas ! these happy results are very few. In ninety-nine cases to one, the bowel being fairly opened and some of its contents let out, death will follow; and it is hardly too much to say that all bayonet, lance, and sword wounds of the belly are deadly. It is scarcely possible for the abdominal viscera to escape if the peritoneal cavity be fairly entered by such weapons as these. It is by no means the same here as in the case of the musket-bullet; —this, from its great velocity, appears now and then to pass completely

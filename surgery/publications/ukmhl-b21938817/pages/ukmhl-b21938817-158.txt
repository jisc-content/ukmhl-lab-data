MILITARY SURGERY. 138 of the femur. If need be, remove its head from the acetabulum; carefully secure every bleeding vessel, thoroughly cleanse the wound from granules of bone, return the flesh to its place, and put in a few sutures. Gently make the limb of the same length as the un- injured one, and apply a long, straight splint, so as to prevent motion, and to keep up some degree of ex- tension. A slight degree of pressure should be applied to the wound by means of lint and plaster : tight bandaging is not on any account to be used. Much will depend on the after treatment of the case.* r * At the siege of the Tort of Luckkie, (the Port of Luckkie lies on the right bank of the Indus ; it was taken by Lieutenant Taylor after twenty-nine days siege. See my sketch of the siege of Mooltan,) a soldier received a large bullet in the right hip, which smashed the trochanter major and thigh-bone. I saw the patient about twelve days after the accident, He had been subjected to native treatment. His thigh was enveloped in many layers of oiled cloth, and the fracture pressed upon by two rude splints. I found the wound in a most offensive state, and freely suppurating. The limb was everted and shortened. The patient's health was much affected by the purulent discharge, which was clearly kept up by a mass of comminuted bone. I removed the fragments, placed the limb on pillows, and he speedily recovered. This man called on me twelve months after, in order to procure a certificate. He could walk about with ease, resting the injured limb upon the ball of the foot. The comminuted portions of bone should have been removed im- mediately after the accident, or the limb amputated at the hip-joint.

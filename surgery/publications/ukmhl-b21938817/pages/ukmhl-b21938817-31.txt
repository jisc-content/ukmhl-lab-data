11 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. either lacerated or cut through, to the imminent peril of life. Again, a neighbouring bone is not unfre- quently seriously damaged (although untouched) by having its periosteum bruised, raised, or, what is almost fatal to its integrity, peeled off its shaft in a circular strip. But the most fatal of all these condi- tions (and which we shall more particularly notice in speaking of incised wounds), is laceration or division of the large and deep-seated veins. Indeed, we look upon wounds of these vessels as more to be feared than those of arteries themselves (except in their immediate consequences); and it will be seen, that painful and formidable operations are necessary to save life when veins are severed, the wound itself being comparatively of minor import. The second form of which we speak is noticeable as being accompanied with lesion of bone. It is not, however, in any great degree more dangerous from this cause, although the cure may be considerably pro- longed. For example, a large portion of the trochanter major may be knocked off, three or more inches of the fibula may be carried away, a piece of the tibia, or a small chip of the femur itself, cut out, and, notwithstanding, all may do well. In fact, where no large vessels are implicated, and the patient has an average constitution, there is every reason to expect a safe and speedy recovery, with little or no deformity of consequence. Lastly, our third division of these injuries demands attention, as it presents the most

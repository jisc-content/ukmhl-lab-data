Together with ordinary symptoms of gun- shot wounds of the abdomen, there will be more or less external or internal hsemorrhage : the latter indi- cated by rapidly sinking pulse, and speedy dissolution. In a very great proportion of these cases death soon follows. All our efforts must here tend to arrest hemorrhage. The most profound quietude and rest must be enjoined, if we would hope to save life, or even to prolong it for a very limited period. In no case that I am acquainted with is the presence of the medi- cal officer so much needed. To give the patient one single chance, it is absolutely necessary he should be seen upon the field, on the very spot where the fatal bullet strikes. To convey him to the hospital, or to carry him any distance, is tantamount to killing him. He will not reach the first alive (we know of no example); the last he will not long survive.

Simple injuries of the spleen are not often * In the battle of Suddozain, a soldier was struck by a small bullet, just above the right anterior-superior spine of the ilium.

No bad consequences foil owed.

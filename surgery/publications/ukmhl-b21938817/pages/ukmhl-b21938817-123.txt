Supposing the leg to be sixteen inches in length, a six-pounder in the height of its power, striking upon the centre of the tibia, crushes to atoms about one- third of its shaft, and the wound extends upwards five inches from the knee. Either the circular or flap operation maybe per- formed. I used to fluctuate between the two,—now preferring the first, and then the second mode. The circular operation is, however, best: the extremity of a flap is apt to slough. Be careful to make your first cut above all discoloured skin. Operation. Affix a tourniquet. Let an assistant steadily support the limb above the knee. Grasp with your left hand the leg below, pass the knife round, and make an in- cision through the skin. Retract the integuments two inches or more according to the thickness of the leg, and with two circular cuts lay bare the bones. Pass a catlin downwards between the tibia and fibula, and again upwards in a similar manner, cutting from and towards yourself, — dividing completely interosseous membrane, muscle, and periosteum. Finally, saw through the bones separately,—the fibula first, holding the saw obliquely ; then the tibia, holding the instru- ment in a horizontal line. The bones may not be sawed together. They cannot

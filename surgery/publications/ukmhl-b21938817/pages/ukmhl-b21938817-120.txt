100 MILITARY SURGERY. ness of purpose. The great danger is loss of blood, which you must guard against by tying the femoral artery at once. Cut down upon it as it emerges from the pelvis, underneath Poupart's ligament, and apply a ligature above the profunda. If, however, you have assistants about you on whom you can fully depend, you may entrust the femoral artery to one of them. You must secure the truncated vessel immediately the anterior flap is completed, and all small vessels too, as a drop of blood cannot be spared. Well, having taken every measure to guard against haemorrhage, and the patient being favourably placed and supported, thrust in a long, straight, one-edged knife, a little above and to the inner side of the trochanter-major. Keep it close to the bone, pass it obliquely downwards and inwards until it protrudes close to the groin, and cut out a flap three inches in length. Instantly reflect and secure the arteries. This being done, and the flap well lifted up, cut down to, and open, the capsular ligament. Direct the assistant to depress the femur slightly, and rotate it outwards forcibly; then divide the ligamentum teres, and disarticulate the thigh-bone. Lastly, pass the knife over the head of the bone, and cut out the posterior flap. Quickly tie every arterial branch,—sponge out all coagula,—insert eight sutures, —apply twelve strips of plaster obliquely,—put a large piece of lint covered with Ceratum Resinae along the course of the wound,—and a bandage over all. As much depends on the after-treatment of these cases, I shall dwell a little upon it, although it is out

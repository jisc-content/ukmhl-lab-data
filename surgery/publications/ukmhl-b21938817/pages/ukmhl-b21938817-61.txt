41 INCISED WOUNDS. may be viewed as the simplest and least dangerous forms of wound we meet with. The treatment relating to them is generally the simplest too j nevertheless, the surgeon is not on this account in any way exonerated from giving them his best attention. His judicious care is most salutary; in truth, his services cannot be dispensed with, as they are essential to the speedy healing of the cut, and to the formation of sound cicatrices. We have said that the treatment is very simple in these instances,â€”too simple it cannot be ; and that surgeon will do by far the best who accustoms himself to the use of the fewest applications. As regards the danger of incised wounds, much will (as in all other cases) depend upon where they are, their depth, and more particularly their direction. Where they follow the course of muscles, arteries, and veins, the prognosis is commonly most favourable, it matters not however extensive they may be.* Incised wounds may extend from the shoulder-blade to the sacrum, going down to the bones, or perchance from'the hip to the knee, laying bare the femur. A * The day after the battle of Suddozam, a Sikh was brought in who had remained upon the field all night. He had upwards of a dozen sword cuts in his head, trunk, and limbs. Together they measured more than two yards ; some of them were two and three inches deep, but chiefly longitudinal wounds. This man completely recovered, and returned to the enemy. In con- tradistinction, about the same time I admitted a soldier with a wound in the calf of the leg, running across and down to the bone. Notwithstanding the best that could be done for him, he died in three days.

44 MILITARY SURGERY. DISLOCATIONS AND SPRAINS Need not be spoken of at length in this place. Where the former are complicated with fracture, (which is by no means uncommon in every campaign), they give no small trouble to the medical officer, who, from want of sufficient apparatus, is often put to all kinds of shifts to meet the exigencies of the case. The very earliest con- sideration is here demanded,—no time must be lost; a delay of minutes will always increase the difficulties— often render them insurmountable. Bad sprains too should never be neglected, as the pain attending them is very great; extensive swelling soon *appears, with effusion and extravasation of blood, which (should fracture accompany the lesion) will render the detection difficult, and now and then impossible. There is a kind of sprain or strain of the joints, particularly of the shoulder-joint, often met with in field practice, especially after a cavalry charge, which presents many untoward symptoms : it is a violent stretching or laceration of ligaments and tendons. It is occasioned most commonly by desperate hewing with the sword, especially if the soldier misses his object. Indeed, the humerus is often dislocated by striking furiously backward with the sabre, capsular liga- ments being torn, and pieces of bone itself detached.

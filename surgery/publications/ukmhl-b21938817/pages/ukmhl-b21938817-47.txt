GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 27 fascia of a muscle,—a button or a coin,—the position of the body,—the shape of the ball, whether it be round or rimmed,—and the distance from whence discharged,— are all assigned as reasons. Nevertheless they do not satisfactorily explain the matter; but it is sufficient for our purpose to know that such cases are common, and satisfactory inasmuch as when these important cavities are concerned, life is more often saved than lost by this erratic property of musket and rifle bullets. In those well-authenticated cases of recovery from gun-shot wounds of the thorax, where apparently the ball has passed directly across the chest, going in on one side and escaping at a corresponding spot on the other; or, perhaps, passing from before backwards, or from above obliquely downwards, and vice versa,—in all these cases we say that recovery is more or less favoured by deviation of the missile from the direct course. It is true enough that many patients recover where both lungs have been perforated, and more often one lung- only being shot through, as we have had cases sufficient to prove : but we repeat that in the majority of those examples where it is said " these patients were shot clean through the lungs," that it would be more correct to say that they were shot through the chest,—the viscera having escaped in consequence of the ball having taken a circular course upwards, downwards, or late- rally. Our treatment of all gun-shot wounds of the chest must be antiphlogistic and palliative, and the cases may

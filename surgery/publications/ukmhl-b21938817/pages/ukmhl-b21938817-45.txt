25 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. At the same time we endeavour to ward off inflam- mation, and its subsequent effects. If a patient happily recover from such a wound as this, he will necessarily be more or less troubled for an uncertain period with shortness of breath,—a slight cough, perhaps, and he will most frequently be unfitted for the duties of a soldier. When one lung is wounded, the symptoms are dange- rous or otherwise according to the position. When high up near the apex, the prognosis is favourable, and there is commonly little bleeding ; when lower down, and amongst the larger trunks of vessels, the prognosis must be bad and the haemorrhage great; and when in the base of the lung, although the discharge of blood is small, and not much dyspnoea present, still there is great danger of fatal consequences from subsequent inflammation. The flow of blood into the air-cells or into the pleural cavity, the former creating a serious obstacle to the aeration of blood, and the latter tending to inflammation, will require our best remedial measures, and admits not of delay. In these, little or no blood escapes by the external wound, but it is coughed up in florid streams, often apparently flowing from the lungs in a continuous current, which nothing but death itself can arrest, and the hapless patient dies from loss of blood. In some cases there is no external evidence of hasmorrhage, but the dyspnoea, already very dis- tressing, becomes every instant more and more so,— which, together with the rapidly falling pulse, are proofs sufficient of fatal bleeding within.

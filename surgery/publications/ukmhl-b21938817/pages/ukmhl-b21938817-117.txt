97 CANNON-SHOT WOUNDS. Case XVIII.—Cannon-shot Wound of the Thigh, with Fracture. This is a case in which, to all intents and purposes, the leg is carried away. It is our first example of those wounds, before spoken of, wherein the round shot, at the height of its velocity and momentum, smashes a limb. It is situate just above the knee-joint. The structures actually impinged upon by the shot are torn to pieces, disorganized, dead; the leg is in effect gone. Amputation of the stump must follow. Perform it immediately. Operation. The old circular mode of operation is best in this and similar cases. In the bilateral or antero-posterior flap, more muscle remains than there is integument to cover. The muscles having been cut away from their in- sertions, retract forcibly towards their origins, and still more forcibly during the passage of the knife through them, leaving a large belly of muscle, more than sufficient to form a good stump,—more than there is skin to cover. Having placed the patient in position, affix a tourni- quet.* Let assistants support the limb above and below. * Always apply a tourniquet in field practice. Some of the larger vessels may, indeed, be commanded by pressure of the fingers ; the smaller cannot, and blood will be lost. It is of the utmost importance not to lose a drop of arterial blood after gun-shot injuries. H

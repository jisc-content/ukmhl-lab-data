CANNON-SHO-rWOUNDS. 109 scaphoid bones ; pass the knife underneath them, and form a flap of the remaining sound plantar muscles and skin. Dress with sutures, plaster, and a bandage, being very careful in dressing this stump not to disturb any adhesion that may have taken place. Much will depend on the after treatment.* Case XXVII.—Cannon-shot Wound of the Toes. The whole of the phalanges, together with the metatarsophalangeal joints, are in this instance de- stroyed. The case presents a fair opportunity for am- putation at the tarso-metatarsal articulation. I do not, however, recommend that operation; I consider the following better; it takes less time to perform,—(very desirable in this painful operation.) The wound heals quicker, and a sounder and a better stump remains. Operation. Grasp the wounded foot with your left hand, resting the point of the index-finger on the base of the meta- tarsal bone of the little toe, the thumb on the inter- nal cuneiform bone, and vice versa. Draw the knife * We cannot expect this stump to heal very favourably or very quickly, seeing that the flap of integument is somewhat short and bruised. As soon as it has healed, or is fairly pro- gressing, the tendo-achillis must be divided by subcutaneous incision ; otherwise the gastrocnemius muscle will forcibly draw the os calcis backwards and upwards, throwing the stump upon the ground.

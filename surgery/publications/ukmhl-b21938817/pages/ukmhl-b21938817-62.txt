MILITARY SURGERY. 42 great gash in the leg, running from the popliteal space to the heel, is common, through which with the finger you may reach the interosseous membrane. Sometimes the belly is laid open to the extent of ten or twelve inches, and occasionally the intestines protrude, and yet death may not follow. There appears, indeed, to be no limit to the extent of sword cuts from which the patient may not recover, provided ever that the incisions take the direction of the muscles and larger vessels. When they follow a transverse course the case is wholly different, and the prognosis is in every instance un- favourable. Happily, transverse wounds of this kind are for the most part found on the external aspect of the limb : for example, on the outer side of the arm, thigh, or leg. On the contrary, if they happen on the inner side and behind, the brachial artery and vein, the femoral artery and vein, or the popliteal artery, or the posterior tibial, with some of the larger nerves, are generally divided, so that (the wound not being appa- rently dangerous,) it becomes the surgeon's duty to apply a ligature, or amputate, or at least to explain clearly the danger to his patient, who, being ignorant of the nature of the wound, will not readily believe that, to save life, he must lose a limb. During the late war I lost many patients who, having been wounded by the sword in their legs,would not submit to amputation. Indeed, I found it impossible to assure them of their danger; consequently they died of mortification or exhaustion. It is a most painful duty on the part of the medical

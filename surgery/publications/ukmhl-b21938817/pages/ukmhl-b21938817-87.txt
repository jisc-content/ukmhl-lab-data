CANNON-SHOT WOUNDS. (57 soon will the brain begin to recover its power, and the patient to return to consciousness. Now wash off all foreign matter, and, if there be only trifling hsernor- rhage, bring back seriatim all the reflected tissues, and replace them carefully and lightly. Apply the warm water dressing, and oiled silk. Place the patient in a dark, cool, and airy place, guard against un- favourable symptoms, and set two men to watch him day and night. Case III.—Cannon-shot Wound—Laceration of the Scalp, with Fracture and Depression of Bone. In this example the squamous portion of temporal bone is starred, and a part driven down upon the brain. The patient lies upon his back, motionless and insensible ; you cannot rouse him. He notices not the roar of cannon being fired at his head. As in the last case, he is dead to all external things. Having placed him in a favourable position, with the head a little raised, lay back the torn integuments, and remove the completely detached pieces; but do not cut away anything. Examine the osseous wound with the finger, and see if there be room to introduce the elevator underneath the depressed bit of bone. There is not space enough; so take Hey's saw, and detach the most prominent angle of bone ; remove it, and raise the depressed piece. Dress the wound as before, put the patient in a dark situation, and set men to attend his wants.

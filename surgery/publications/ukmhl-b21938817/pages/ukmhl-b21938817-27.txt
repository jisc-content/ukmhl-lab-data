GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 7 soldier dies upon the field from loss of blood, whose life might have been saved by the prompt assistance of the surgeon. In the field-hospital, the wounded man is brought to you: he has lost a limb, and there is literally no haemorrhage; but is he not faint, and incapable of speaking ? His body is cold; his pulse scarcely perceptible; his respiration slow and labour- ing j and his clothes covered with blood. See him on the field, on the spot where the round-shot strikes him, and you will find bleeding sufficient to call forth your best skill to restrain. We have seen blood pour out in florid streams;—we have seen it pour through every covering that a wounded man's com- rade could apply: and we have seen it ooze in no small quantity from a wound long after the receipt of the injury. Enough has been said, then, to prove that haemorrhage follows injuries from shot and shell. We ourselves are accustomed to look upon loss of blood as the first thing to be guarded against in all gun-shot wounds, and we hasten to our patients ac- cordingly. If we do not, we shall assuredly lose many of them. It is the safer plan—it is the better prin- ciple—to view all wounds of this nature as haenior- rhagic; although it is unquestionably true, that many gun-shot wounds do not bleed at all.* * A soldier had his leg carried away during the first siege of Mooltan, close to my tent. He lost scarcely an ounce of hlood: what he did lose was venous. This patient suffered very severely from the shock, but rallied during amputation, and did well. Chloroform would have killed him.

134 MILITARY SURGERY. Case XLIX.â€”Gun-shot Wound of the Bladder per Perinceum. In all gun-shot wounds of the perinseum and parts about, the bladder should be examined with a full-sized sound, in order to ascertainif the bullet be lodged therein. In this example, the situation of the wound in front of the anus, its direction, and the discharge of urine by it, lead us to conclude that the bullet has passed into the vesical cavity. We ascertain whether it has passed out of it again by means of the sound. It has not passed out; it remains in the bladder. Proceed, there- fore, to remove it per perinseum. Operation. Place the patient on a table with his legs drawn up and secured, exactly as in the lateral operation for stone. Make an incision two inches in length through the skin and superficial fascia immediately across the wound; pass the index finger into it in order to enlarge it, and carry it into the bladder. Then introduce the smallest sized lithotomy forceps, and extract the ball. If the extraneous body cannot be thus removed, which indeed it seldom can, the lateral operation must be performed, as in lithotomy. For minute description of this operation see Mr. Bransby Cooper's " Essays on Lithotomy," or any other recognised authority. For my purpose a short description will suffice.

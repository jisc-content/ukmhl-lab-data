It must be remembered that these ends are not always to be gained by any fixed system of practice. I will not recommend either an active or inactive, a strong or mild form of treatment, because I know that neither can at all times be depended upon. No ; let the surgeon meet, as best he can, each and every untoward symp- tom. He should notice whether the patient be an European, a Mussulman, or Hindoo.

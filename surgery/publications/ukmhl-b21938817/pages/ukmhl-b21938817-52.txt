The symptoms attendant here are commonly identical with those of cannon-shot and shell wounds,â€”except, of course, in degree. It is worthy of notice that in the very simplest kinds of gun-shot wounds (and that, too, when least expected), we often meet with alarming constitutional disturbance, such as extreme depression and general prostration, or perhaps great mental alarm and excitement. Sometimes we find little or no pain, and trifling haemorrhage; at others much suffering is evinced, and very considerable bleeding present. We noticed in the case of two officers (wounded in the first advance on Mooltan, one in the ankle-joint, the other in the thigh),* the most singular symptoms of cerebral disturbance, indicated by periodical loss of memory, incoherent mutterings, and craving for some particular food or medicine. In one case, pus formed in the smaller joints, and the patient died; in the other, no apparent reasons could be detected. The wound healed most favourably from the first, and recovery was complete. We have noticed also similar abnormal con- ditions amongst the wounded sepoys, sometimes re- maining to the end, or coming and going at regular intervals.

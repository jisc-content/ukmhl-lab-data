GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 135 Operation. Place the patient near the edge of a strong table. Draw up his legs, and fasten his hands to his feet. Support his back with pillows, and let his thighs be held firmly apart, in such a manner as to bring the whole of the perinseum fairly into view Now carry a full-sized straight staff into the bladder,* and direct an assistant how to hold it steadily in position. Seat yourself upon a chair, and place the point of your left index finger on the raphe of the perinseum, opposite the arch of the pubis. Now make an incision from the point of your finger downwards and outwards to a spot midway between the anus and tuberosity of the ischium, and a line or two beyond. Next pass the finger into the upper part of the wound, and feel for the groove in the staff, into which carry the point of the knife guided by the finger, hold the point of the knife firmly in the groove, and make a cut in its course to the extent of an inch. Lastly, draw down the staff horizontally, and push the knife along it, keeping it steadily in the groove, into the bladder. Withdraw the knife without cutting in any direction; pass the finger, draw out the staff. Introduce the forceps over the finger, and extract the foreign body. If bleeding follows, apply pressure, and it will soon stop. Do not pass a catheter by the wound in order to inflame and * It is sometimes difficult to introduce the staff after tying up the patient. I often pass the instrument before taking that step. It is a good plan.

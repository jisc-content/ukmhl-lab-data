53 TREATMENT OF WOUNDS. Calomel is without doubt the most useful of all remedies. It is common to give twenty or thirty grains at a time in India. I believe ten grains to be the proper dose, and six generally sufficient. Opium differs in strength and purity in every climate ; it is not the same in every shop. Its influence upon the patient is to be carefully watched, and the dose regulated accordingly. Marching.—The wounded should be dressed, or at least examined, before leaving the old ground, and after they reach the new. Wounds.—When in doubt as to the propriety of operating in case of wounds, being on the march should determine in favour of the operation. Formula.—I have no hesitation in recommending the following formulae for the preparation of medicines in field practice :— Pills. F. 1. Common Purgative Pills. ft Pulveris Scammonii, Cambogias, — Rhei, Saponis Duri, aa. 33. Extracti Colocynth. Comp. siv. Olei Carui, f^j. Misce fiat Massa, gr. x. vel xx. pro dosi.

GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 155 of one bone only is crushed, extirpation of that extre- mity should be practised, as our example fully shows. The bullet passed through the condyles of the humerus, fracturing them into many pieces. The radius and ulna, the principal artery, veins, and nerves, have escaped ; the condyles of the humerus alone are in- jured. Soft parts are not extensively torn. The case affords a fair opportunity for excision of thesjoint. Operation. Place the patient in a favourable position, with the arm bent, and commence the operation by making an incision from a spot two inches above the internal condyle, posterior to the brachial artery, to a corre- sponding spot two inches above the external condyle. First carry the knife downwards to the internal con- dyle ; then outwards over the extremity of the olecranon process of the ulna, to the external condyle; and lastly, upwards to a spot already marked on the outer side of the arm. Dissect back both skin and muscle—care- fully avoiding the ulnar nerve, which must be turned aside—to the necessary extent, and bring into view the his best officers was badly wounded in the right elbow-joint. I saw him a few days after, when suppuration was profuse. The articulating extremities of the humerus, radius, and ulna, were all exposed to view,—the latter two broken. The patient would not hear of amputation, or even of extraction of detached portions of bone, but left camp in disgust of the European doc- tor. He recovered, with a useless arm.

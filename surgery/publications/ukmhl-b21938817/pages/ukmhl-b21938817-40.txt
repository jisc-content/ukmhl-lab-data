20 MILITARY SURGERY. and turns from the direct course itself, giving, perhaps, one chance of escape to the patient by avoiding the more dangerous structures, and traversing those that can recover from its dreadful effects. Therefore, when the ball has not escaped, and it is desirable to ascertain its position and to remove it, we may expect to find it considerably out of the direct line?â€”either above or below, on the right or left hand.

In truth, we are compelled to view all such cases as inevitably fatal; but there are exceptions, and not unfrequent ones, wherein the patient recovers when we dare not hope for so desirable a result. There are many soldiers now doing duty in our ranks, for whom (having been wounded in their heads during the late war,) the medical officers had not the smallest hope j and every military surgeon who has had much practice in the field, has learned not to despair so long as life remains.

In treating, however, of extremes, we comprehend all cases of minor import,

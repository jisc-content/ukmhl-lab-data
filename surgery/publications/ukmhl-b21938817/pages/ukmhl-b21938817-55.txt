We have already said these injuries will be more or less dangerous according to the charge of powder used, and the distance from whence the bullet comes, par- ticularly according to the part of the limb, and more so still according to the nature of the structure injured. When the shoulder is the seat of injury, the prog- nosis is for the most part bad. The bones are gene- rally fractured into many pieces, perchance both above and below the joints. Perhaps the bullet lies imbedded in the joint itself in one articulating extremity, or, having sufficient momentum, passes through.

If he determines to save the limb, he must be prepared for severe constitutional disturbance and considerable local inflammation, together with very copious exhausting suppuration. If the hip-joint, or the parts about, be wounded, the constitutional symp- toms run high, and the prognosis must be guarded. Commonly the bones of the pelvis are also concerned,

When one bone only is fractured, and the tibial arteries re- main untouched, primary amputation should scarcely be thought of. In every case, at least wait until the suppurative process be fully established. Then only operate when the discharge of pus is very profuse, and likely to exhaust the patient. With regard to the case in hand, the ball entered the left leg close to the tibia on the inner side, passed backwards and outwards, and you find it lodged upon the fibula behind. There is very considerable arterial haemorrhage from the wound, and consequently suffi- cient reason to conclude that the posterior tibial artery is injured. Treatment.

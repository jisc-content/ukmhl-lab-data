We have seen the plate taken from a soldier's breast without his being aware of the slightest shock: and we have ourselves been near enough to many a shot to feel its wind, if it had any to impart. It is, however, unquestionable, that all cases attributed to the above cause should be laid to the contact of the ball itself j and we are satisfied, that the missile actually strikes the injured part in all and every instance, light although the blow may be.* It is occasionally difficult to say why external evidence of injury is not present, when much pain, and even death itself, follows the contact of a cannon- ball.

The patient got up, and walked to my tent.

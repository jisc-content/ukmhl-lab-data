CANNON-SHOT WOUNDS. 107 Case XXV—Cannon-shot Wound of the Leg, with Fractured Fibula. We very rarely meet with cannon-shot wounds of the extremities, wherein bone is fractured, that admit of reparation. Alas! all,—nearly all, peremptorily demand amputation. I have sought amongst hundreds of wounded for one such case. The cases before us are, however, examples. At the battle of Suddozam, a native artillery officer was gallantly standing to his guns, when one of Moolraj's six-pounders struck him on the outer side of the right leg, close to the head of the fibula, followed the course of that bone, crushing it to atoms, and escaped an inch above the external malleolus. The integuments and muscles are lacerated in the usual manner. The wound when laid open presents a raw torn surface, eleven inches by six. It is not deep; there is little bleeding. The tibia is wholly untouched. Do not amputate. Quickly cleanse the wound. Remove loose portions of bone. Return the torn tissues to their places as best you may.

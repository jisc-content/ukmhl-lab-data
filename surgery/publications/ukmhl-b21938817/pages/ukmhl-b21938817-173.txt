The fore-arm should be between pronation and supination j the whole arm rotated slightly inwards, and the outlines of the deltoid muscle brought fairly into view. These preparatory measures having been taken, make an incision, with a large scalpel, from a spot opposite to the coracoid process, downwards along the anterior border of the deltoid, round and upwards along the posterior border to a spot level with the joint. Dissect up the deltoid muscle and integuments together (taking care not to wound the long and short head of the biceps), and bring into view the head and neck of the humerus. If there be bleeding from small vessels, let assistants make pressure with the finger's point. Now extirpate the head of the bone, according to the nature of the fracture, and most carefully remove all portions of cancellated structure. Cleanse out the joint, and secure all bleeding arteries. Lastly, return the flap, and dress on common principles. The arm must be well supported, but the humerus must not be lifted towards the glenoid cavity. The muscles them- selves will draw up the bone as the healing process goes on, and adapt themselves to its shortened condi- tion. Motion must be as far as possible prevented until the wound heals, after which passive motion may be commenced with, and continued until a good and serviceable arm remains to the soldier.

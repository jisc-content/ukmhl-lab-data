MILITARY SURGERY. 64 TREATMENT OF LACERATED WOUNDS OF THE HEAD. Case I.—Cannon-shot Wound—Simple Laceration of Scalp. A cannon-ball, at the height of its velocity, has inflicted a simple lacerated wound of the integuments of the cranium. The wound is six inches by four. The skin, superficial fascia, tendon of the occipito- frontalis muscle, and pericranium, are all more or less torn. The patient has vomited freely, and consequently recovered from the first effects of the shock. His pulse is somewhat accelerated, and he suffers con- siderable pain. Therefore, let him take immediately— ft Tinct. Opii, inxl. Spt. iEther. Nitrici, irvxv. Misturse Camphorse, ^ij. M. Haustus. Having placed him on a bed, with the head slightly raised and shoulders well supported, cut away the hair, and shave it off around the injury. Gently wash out all extraneous matter, and return to their natural places all the lacerated tissues, beginniDg with the pericranium. Be careful not to use either ligatures or sutures. Apply soft lint dipped in warm water, to which a little Tincture of Opium may be added; carry a bandage wetted with the same round the head, and place oil silk over all.

147 (iUN-SHOT WOUNDS. I believe Mr. Guthrie insists that in every case the artery should be tied above and below the wound. I cannot question so great an authority; indeed, I am fully aware that in bleeding from considerable arteries nothing equals the ligature in preventing further hae- morrhage j but I must say, I also fully believe that in every case it cannot be done : for instance, when the limb is very fleshy, very much swollen (having been bandaged upon the field), and filtrated with blood ; or when a bullet enters the leg at the junction of the middle with the lower third, runs upwards to the ham, and wounds the artery by the way. In this case it would be almost impossible to ascertain the exact posi- tion of the wound in the vessel. To follow the course of the ball until you reach the divided artery, would be scarcely justifiable. To cut down upon the vessel, either by the side of the tibia, or vertically through the gas- trocnemius and soleus muscles, would be still less likely to succeed. Apparently, then, nothing remains to be clone, but either to tie the femoral artery, or to ampu- tate. Well-applied pressure may, however, be tried. The bullet must be extracted; firm compresses of lint, many times folded, placed upon the wounds j and a well-wet ted bandage carried from the extremity of the toes to the groin. The limb must be raised up, as in fractured patella, and carefully supported. Profound good deal, as I am sorry to say the most violent inflammation came on, which the next morning had extended to the middle of the thigh, leaving no hope of the patient's recovery.

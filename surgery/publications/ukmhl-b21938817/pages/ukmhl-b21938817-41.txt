When we come to consider the treatment of the various lesions, we shall from our own experience append such cases as we hope will interest and give confidence in our measures. " Experientia docet." Experience has not failed, in our case, to teach us many things of which we knew but little previous to being placed in charge of a large army; and our un- controlled practice with the irregular force at Mooltan must necessarily have given abundant opportunities for observation, which could not fail to benefit s and we hope the results of our experience will in some measure benefit those of our younger brethren, who cannot have had much practice in the field.

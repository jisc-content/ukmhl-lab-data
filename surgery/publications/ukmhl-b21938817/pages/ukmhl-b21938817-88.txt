MILITARY SURGERY. 68 Case IV.—Cannon-shot Wound—Laceration of the Scalp, with Comminuted Fracture. Here we have very considerable lesion of bone. The os parietale is broken into many pieces, some of which are detached, and apparently depressed ; never- theless, the patient is perfectly sensible, and complains neither of much pain nor uneasiness. Do not now attempt to remove the broken portions of bone. There are no symptoms of compression,—therefore cover up the wound lightly, keep it moist and warm, (not hot,) and leave the case for the most part to nature. Re- member, all meddling here will increase the danger of fatal inflammation. Your prognosis is bad enough, it is true, but you cannot better it by dabbling in the wound. The patient being an European, and a strong man, bleed him from the arm effectually, and give him by the mouth— ft Hydrarg. Chloridi, gr. x. Pulv. Ipecac, gr. ij. Ext. Hyoscyami, gr. ij. Conf. q. s.

MILITARY SURGERY. 176 CHAPTER IV. INCISED WOUNDS. It is not necessary, neither can we stop, to describe a great number of these injuries. In Indian warfare they are exceedingly common. The Sikh and Affghan prefer the curved sword (always excepting the great gun,) to any other weapon ; and they use it with terrible effect, making most ghastly wounds. They do not strike directly downward as we do with the sabre, but they draw and strike together, and consequently occasion incisions of wonderful extent. Case LXXX.—Incised Wound of the Scalp. In this instance the patient was most effectually scalped,—a portion of the integuments three inches by two and a half being cut clean off, leaving the vertex of the skull completely bare. There is some bleeding, which pressure will check. This patient had six other severe incised wounds.

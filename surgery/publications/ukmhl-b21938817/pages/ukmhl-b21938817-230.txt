210 MILITARY SURGERY. When the pain is very severe, a wide bandage should be carried round the lower part of the abdomen, or pressure made with the hands. The patient should lie down upon his back, and raise his feet and legs against a bank, or the trunk of a tree, so as to favour gravita- tion towards the upper region of the abdomen.* Tight belts round the waist are always injurious; in the present instance tbey are highly so, and should never be worn. A flannel bandage applied to the lower part of the abdomen is an excellent preventive, and should never be neglected. For pains in the side, unattended with inflammatory symptoms, and purely spasmodic, a dose of * R ^Ether. Sulph. Comp. %ss. Mist. Camphorse, f5iss. will generally suffice, aided by rest and local pressure. A mustard poultice, or the spirit of turpentine applied on lint, will almost immediately remove these spasms, * In cases of unmixed spasmodic tormina, standing for an instant or two npon the head will in almost every case give immediate relief. It would, we own, be comical enough to see long-legged soldiers standing on their heads by the road side ; nevertheless, we recommend them to do so in defau t of other means. I could give endless examples of this rental measure. In one instance, being on a pedestrian excursion in IS orth AVales, mv fellow traveller was often afflicted with gripes, and as often completely removed them by lying down near a gate, and carry- ing his feet from one bar to the other till he reached the t P , thus resting on his shoulders, with his heels on the top of the gate.

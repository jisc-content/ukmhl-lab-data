12 MILITARY SURGERY. complete specimens of superficial lacerated wounds that can be conceived, and they are frequently of wonderful extent. Their immediate effects upon the general system are now and then considerable, but, with ordinary care, they soon subside; and, on the whole, these wounds may be looked upon as by no means dangerous to life. Much, of course, will depend on the nature of the structures torn through or carried away, and upon the seat of the injury itself. In our practice (which has been pretty considerable with this kind of wound), we do not remember having lost more than a dozen patients, although, in many cases, the solution of continuity of soft parts was very considerable. Sometimes, indeed, these lacerations are so extensive as to appear greater than even round- shot themselves are capable of producing. For example, the muscles and integuments of the back may be ploughed up from the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra to the sacrum; or the thigh laid open from the trochanter major to the knee-joint; or the leg, from the popliteal space to the heel. The skin in these cases will, of necessity, be fearfully torn, and more or less disposed to slough, according to the extent of separation from the subjacent structures. The loss of substance will depend mainly on the depth of the wound ; and the amount of suppuration will be smaller or greater, according to the extent of lacera- tion. Four things are chiefly to be guarded against here, namely, constitutional irritation and general

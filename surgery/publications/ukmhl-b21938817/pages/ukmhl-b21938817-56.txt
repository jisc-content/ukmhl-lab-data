MILITARY SURGERY. 3G which increases twofold the danger: palliative remedies only are admissible here. When the shaft of the femur is fractured and (as almost always happens) comminuted,—when the humerus is broken,—or if the brachial or femoral artery, or femoral vein be divided,—the case admits of no delay; the surgeon must quickly determine the course he will pursue. If the thigh-bone, or any other bone, be violently struck by a ball, but not broken, the danger to life is, nevertheless, often great. Perios- titis, and inflammation of bone itself, are wont to ensue, with a formidable train of symptoms difficult to remove; and, although the hapless patient lingers many months, he dies at length worn out by the discharge of pus. Again, when the elbow, knee, or ankle-joint, is shot through, the medical officer's most serious consideration is needed. His first care is to save life, his next to save the limb. If he attempts the last, he must use his best endeavour to render it useful. Indeed, the chances of its being ultimately serviceable to the soldier must have great weight in his primary decision. Wounds of the fore-arm and hand, leg and foot, are very common. They do not militate against life in any comparison to the last. They are, however, suf- ficiently formidable and troublesome. They need much care when the arteries and veins are wounded, and when the bones are extensively comminuted.

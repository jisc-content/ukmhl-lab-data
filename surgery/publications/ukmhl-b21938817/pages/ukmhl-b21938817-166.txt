This knowledge will not, how- ever, always lead you to the divided vessel; you must be guided by the course of the wound, and the flow of blood. Slightly slacken the tourniquet, and notice accurately whence the blood flows: again tighten it, sponge well the wound, and search for the truncated vessel above and below.

Visit him frequently, and examine the state of the leg and wound, by the appearance of which you must be wholly guided in your treatment. * * To tie the posterior tibial artery is a difficult, painful, and dangerous operation. Too much care cannot be taken in order to prevent unnecessary laceration of soft parts. In extracting bullets, force should not be used ; it is apt to induce inflamma- tion and its worst consequences. During the second siege of Mpoltan, a man was brought in, some six hours after the accident, with a bullet in his leg ; I easily detected it lying between the bones behind. I passed a forceps, seized the ball, and began to draw it out. It moved easily enough at first, but soon got jammed, and I was obliged to use considerable force in order to get it out. It was very much flattened and very ragged, and must have torn soft parts a

CANNON-SHOT WOUNDS. 115 perform it; neither shall I stop to describe it. I will not recommend that operation ; I disapprove of it; I consider it dangerous, and seriously protest against it when men are being moved from place to place. I lost three patients in succession dining the war, and with- out any reason, save that the flexor and extensor ten- dons, moving so freely, interrupt the healing process, occasion violent constitutional irritation, and death. Amputation just below the insertion of the pronator radii teres is the safe and proper course. Case XXXIII. â€” Cannon-shot Wound of the Hand, extending to the Carpal Bones. This case admits of amputation at the wrist-joint, an easy and a safe operation ; makes a neat stump, and seldom terminates unfavourably. Operation. Having placed the patient in a suitable position, with a tourniquet applied, bandage up the mutilated mem- ber, and grasp it with your left hand, an assistant holding the limb above. Make a semilunar incision across the back of the hand, from the styloid process of the ulna to that of the radius, and a similar flap on the palmar aspect.* * Some surgeons disarticulate the bones, and cut the palmar flap after. This method necessarily includes portions of the flexor tendons, which I consider by no means desirable. The flaps should be composed of integument only.

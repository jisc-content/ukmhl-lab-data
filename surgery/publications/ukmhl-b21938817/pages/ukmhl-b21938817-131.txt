CANNON-SHOT WOUNDS. Ill Place the patient on his left side, slightly turned on his face, and bring the whole of the shoulder fairly into view. Let assistants stand by, to arrest haemorrhage, and to supply the operator's wants. Now, with a large scalpel, make an incision from the inferior angle of the scapula, in the course of the anterior costa, over the head of the humerus, and three inches down the outer side of the arm ; a second in- cision from the point of the acromion to the posterior superior angle.

Lastly, make a long flap of the remaining muscle and integument on the inner aspect of the arm. Make pressure on the subclavian artery before you divide the axillary. Instantly secure the vessel, and all others that bleed. Saw or nip off the ragged end of the clavicle. Bring back the reflected structures, and cover up the Avound as best you may.

PUNCTURED WOUNDS. 173 posterior tibial artery. The blood flows per saltum in considerable quantity, and will destroy life if it be not speedily checked. Treatment. The first thing to be done is to apply a tourniquet to the femoral artery, in order to stop the immediate flow of blood ; the next, to apply a ligature to the artery above and below the wound. In these cases it should always be done. You have not the same diffi- culties to contend with as in laceration of the artery by a bullet. By a ball the artery is torn sometimes at a great distance from the external wound, and you cannot, without producing great mischief, find the vessel. In puncture, the wound itself will lead you to the artery, if sufficient care be taken. Even here, however, it is not very easy to tie the posterior tibial. The muscles become very irritable, and retract spasmodically, render- ing it necessary to proceed very carefully and slowly with the steps of the operation. Especially endeavour not to pass the artery, and relax the gastrocnemius muscle as much as possible by flexing the leg upon the thigh and extending the foot.

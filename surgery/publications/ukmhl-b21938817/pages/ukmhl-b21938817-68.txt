MILITARY SURGERY. 48 Let these means be what they may, before all things it is necessary (ere the surgeon enters on the field of practice) that they should be so arranged as to be ever present to the hand, and, according to their nature or purposes, as good and as serviceable as circumstances will permit. Of special medicines and prescriptions we have nought to say (we shall give our own forms as we pass); every medical man has learned to give preferences, both to medicines, instruments, and appliances,â€”experience is his safest guide; but we cannot too strongly recommend the most simple forms of treatment, and we protest against all kinds of complicated apparatus. They never answer well, even in our best regulated hospitals at home. They are mostly more than useless in the field of battle, and not unfrequently highly injurious. The same may be said of numberless instruments; they are doubtless very serviceable in their way, and they are unquestion- ably very cleverly constructed. They are pretty, too, and apt to take the fancy, particularly of subordinate medical officers, who seem to think they can scarcely have too many machines in use. For our own part, we have considerable confidence in our fingers, having had occasion to make pretty considerable use of them during the late war. Our practice apparently far exceeded our means, but it was more apparent than real; for we do not remember that our cases did one jot the less favourably than those that are attended by all the most approved remedies that the ingenuity of the age can produce.

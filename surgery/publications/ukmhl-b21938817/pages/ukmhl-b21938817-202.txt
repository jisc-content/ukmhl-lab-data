MILITARY SURGERY. 182 Case LXXXV.—Incised Wound of the Abdomen. This wound is situate in the left lumbar region, and a portion of colon protrudes. There is a clean cut in that bowel, two inches in length. Treatment. Bring the wound in the intestine neatly together by the continued- suture. Cleanse the bowel, and return that portion last which protruded first. Close the wound in the abdominal parietes with sutures, plasters, a compress and bandage. Turn the patient a little towards his sound side, and support him well with pillows. Enjoin profound repose. Do not give either medicine, food, or drink, for the first twenty-four hours. If, indeed, there be muscular spasm and much pain, two grains of solid opium may be administered. The after-treatment will entirely depend on circumstances. Case LXXXVI — Incised Wound on the External Aspect of the Thigh. A longer incised wound than this I have never seen. It extends from the great trochanter to the head of the fibula, penetrating in several places down to the femur. The patient does not evince much constitutional dis- turbance, neither is he in great pain.

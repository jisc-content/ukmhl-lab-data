1G MILITARY SURGERY. When, unhappily, the abdomen is the part injured, and its upper region, particularly the scrobiculus cordis, is the portion impinged upon, instantaneous death most often follows. In the cases which have fallen to our care, we uniformly noticed little external injury ; in some, none. In two or three instances there was con- siderable puffing up of the abdominal integuments, and the intestines appeared distended with air. The chief symptoms here, are arrest of the heart's action, indicated by extremely feeble or totally imperceptible pulse, and most laborious thoracic breathing. The intellects retain their power commonly even to the last; but dissolution soon follows if relief cannot be given. The above fatal effects are clearly the result of shock to the plexus of ganglionic nerves which are distributed to the abdominal viscera from the semi- lunar ganglia. To stimulate the heart and vascular system to renewed action, to restore the respiratory processes, and to maintain the natural warmth of the body, are the curative measures obviously called for here, and no time is to be lost in endeavouring to was not more than five hundred yards distant; but, fortunately for the individual, the missile first struck a bank, and, hopping over, fell upon his chest, just below the right breast. I saw him on the spot. Eespiration was suspended, and the pulse imperceptible. He, however, soon revived, and I sent him into hospital on my own horse. Before the end of the action I met him again on the field ; but he did not recover the effects of the wound for many months, a troublesome sore following, over which, for a time, remedies appeared to have no control.

Case XIII.—Cannon-shot Wound—Lacerations of the External Generative Organs. During the war we treated a considerable number of cases. One or two examples, however, will suffice to illustrate the whole. In the first, we find the penis alone injured. The gland is gone, with perhaps about* one half of the whole organ.

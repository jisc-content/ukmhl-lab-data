MILITARY SURGERY. 186 ground. He captured the camels, and killed or wounded nearly every man forming the escort. Of sixteen who were brought in wounded with the sword, two-thirds presented cuts in their hands, arms, and shoulders. Case XCII.â€”Incised Wound of the Shoulder-joint. The deltoid muscle is in this example cut clean across, the insertions of the spinati and teres minor muscles divided, and the joint laid fairly open. The arm hangs powerless by the side, and cannot be lifted up by the greatest effort of the patient. Treatment. Apply ligatures to the truncated arteries, in order to prevent the further escape of blood into the joint. Quickly cleanse the wound with a well-pressed sponge. Water (especially that you are wont to get in field- hospitals) is very irritating to open joints. Lift up the arm to a right angle with the body, and support it in that position in the best manner possible. Insert four sutures, and apply four or five strips of plaster obliquely, supporting each other. Carry a wetted bandage over all, and keep it moist. Let the lancet, calomel, antimony, salines, purgatives, &c. be held in readiness to meet inflammatory symptoms. Enjoin quietude and low diet, and the soldier will recover and be able to wield the sword again.

Scalpels and Bistouries should be held between the thumb, index, and middle fingers. Probes, Sounds, Catheters, Artery-Forceps, Needles, fyc, fyc, should be lightly held between the index finger and thumb. Sutures should be rather too large than too small; should pass only through the skin. Apparatus and Appliances, when they give much pain, should be removed, changed, or re-adjusted. Bandaging.—To bandage well is only to be acquired by practice. The apothecaries generally, in India, and the native doctors always, bandage very badly.

Bleeding should be continued until some decided effect is produced, but not to complete syncope. The patient should be either standing or sitting.

185 INCISED WOUNDS. Case XC. —Incised Wound of the Ankle-joint. Incised wounds of the ankle are not often occa- sioned without much force ; they consequently render amputation necessary. If it be determined to save the joint, the treatment must be strictly in accordance with that laid down for similar wounds of the knee. Above all things measures must be taken to fix the joint, and prevent the slightest motion. Case XCI.—Incised Wound of the Shoulder-joint. There are no parts of the soldier's body so much ex- posed to the trenchant sword as his upper extremities. I can safely aver, that in all our hand-to-hand encounters with the Sikhs, four-fifths of the men killed or wounded with the sword presented smaller or greater cuts in their shoulders and arms. In striking either right or left with the sabre, although you direct the blow at your enemy's head, it most often falls upon his shoulder. A few days after I took medical charge of Major Edwardes's troops before Mooltan, Moolraj attacked a party sent out to guard our camels to their feeding not submit. Whereupon 1 did all in ray power to save his leg, but without avail: mortification speedily set in, and he died on the fifth day.

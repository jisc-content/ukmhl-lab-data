9 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. injury to an extremity, the case is one of the most formidable the surgeon meets with in the field,â€”with regard to which there is little or nothing to be done, but to enjoin the strictest quietude for an indefinite period. We have just said that the round-shot, when it fairly impinges on a limb soon after leaving the gun, inevitably destroys it: the member is for ever lost! The injury that necessarily entails so serious a depriva- tion must obviously be severe and perilous. Never- theless, the wound is not so dangerous to life, or nearly so difficult to treat, as the injury the same shot is about to produce when it has travelled four or five hundred yards further, or when, perhaps, it has nearly reached its goal: then it is that it occasions the most severe lesions which can befall the extremities of man. In the former instance, the missile cuts comparatively clean through the tissues, without materially injuring the parts above. Its rapidity is so great, that it has not time, as it were, to do mischief but to the struc- tures with which it actually comes in contact. In the latter (having lost somewhat of its impetus), it tears its way, apparently with some little difficulty, through the structures, and hangs in the wound long enough to impart its destructive influence to the adjacent tissues. The wound, for the most part, has the following untoward aspect, viz. the integuments are extensively lacerated above and below; the muscles dreadfully torn and separated from their attachments, and their interspaces arc filled with coagulated blood ; vessels,

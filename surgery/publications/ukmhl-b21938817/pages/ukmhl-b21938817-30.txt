MILITARY SURGERY. 10 nerves, and tendons hang down in shreds; the bones are fearfully comminuted, and, worse still, some- times fractured a considerable distance from the wound itself. For example, when the seat of injury is just above the ankle-joint, the tibia may be split up, or broken close to the knee; or when the knee itself, or the thigh immediately above it, is destroyed, the femur may be fractured in the middle of its shaft, close to the trochanter minor, or even as high up as the neck of the bone. These cases are, consequently, immi- nently dangerous, and difficult to deal with, and the surgeon has an unenviable duty to perform. He must, nevertheless, do it with promptitude and decision, no matter however painful it may be. The next forms of injuries which claim our attention are flesh or superficial lacerated wounds. And these may be divided into three kinds, namely, the trans- verse, (and they are by far the most dangerous), those that are accompanied with slight lesion of bone, and the longitudinal, or those that, either upwards or downwards, take the course of the muscles, vessels, and nerves. Our first division of these injuries, as we have before said, is by far the most dangerous, and for the follow- ing obvious reasons,—viz. 1st, there is much greater loss of substance in proportion to the extent of the wound; 2d, the muscles are much more torn, being often completely divided, — a large piece, perhaps, wholly carried away. The large and deep-sealed vessels are greatly endangered, and, for the most part,

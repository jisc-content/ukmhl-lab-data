In every instance now before us, the bones were comminuted—smashed ; and although the soft parts were little torn, the arteries and nerves untouched, still in all it was absolutely necessary to amputate. If you do not cut off the arm, long-conti- nued suppuration will cut off the patient.* Amputate as at Case XXXI. Case LXII.—Gun-shot Wound of the Elbow-joint. Gun-shot wounds of the elbow-joint generally de- mand amputation.f When the articulating extremity * During our first advance upon Mooltan, a native officer was wounded as above, so severely, that I at once proposed to ampu- tate.

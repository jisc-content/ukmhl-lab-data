After a time sympathetic dis- turbance of the other eye supervened, and enucleation was performed. The white appearance was then found to he due to great inflammatory effusion in and upon the retina and choroid. The sympathetic symptoms disappeared after the enucleation, and vision, which had fallen to f, re- turned to the normal standard. The range of accommodation also in- creased after the enucleation from to -i. The clinical interest of the case rests chiefly on the production of sympathetic troubles by an injury which implicated only the outer side of the sclerotic, and which neither directly, nor by tbe subsequent inflammation, affect*ed the ciliary body. A Wound of the zygoma by a rifle-ball was said by the patient to have been followed by defective vision, and the conditions were very analogous to those sometimes presented in civil practice by “ railway cases.” The injury was inflicted on the i8th of Aug. 18705 and the patient (twenty-one years old) was flrst seen by Dr. Cohn on the 6th of the following January. He presented the scar of the wound of entrance in the body of the right malar bone, about half an inch below the external canthus, and that of the wound of exit an inch and a quarter further back, over the temporal process. The patient said that for the flrst three months he could scarcely see at all with the right eye. It had received no direct injury, either internal or external, but seemed to pro- trude a very little more than its fellow, and its tension seemed some- what higher. Field of vision normal. The optic nerve showed no exca- vation, and some slightly winding veins in the retina were found also in the other eye. There was no manifest difference in colour between the discs, but perhaps the right was a trace less red than the left. The pupils of equal size, the right somewhat more sluggish. The vision was very carefully tested on the the 6th of January by Dr. Cohn’s assistant, and on the 8th by Dr. Cohn himself, with the following results: January 6.

The*test-types employed on the different occasions were not the same, and the suspicion of malingering was excited when it was found that the S of the uuinjured left eye varied from to f g between the

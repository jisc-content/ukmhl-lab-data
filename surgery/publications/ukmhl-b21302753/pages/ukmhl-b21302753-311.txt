bvAElOTOMY, 301 be n, piece of bone three quarters of au inch square. No piles were found. A jjrobe passed through the ojoening entered the rectum a short distance above the sphincter, and a considerable cavity remained where the bone had rested. The following day two other small pieces of bone were removed. The fistula was subsequently slit up. The patient declared that he felt more comfortable than he had done for twenty years. He regained his former activity. The pieces of bone were examined and were possibly j)ortions of the scajDula of a rabbit. The patient thought it had been “in him all those years,” if so, it must have lodged in some part of the intestine, ulcerated its way out and gradually reached the pelvic opening. There was no history of any injury to the spine or sacrum. (‘ Lancet,’ Aug. 26, 1871, 289.) Ovariotomy.—Mr. Alcock operated on a child three years old. The tumour was universally adherent.

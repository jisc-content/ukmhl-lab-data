291 OBTURATOE HERNIA—HERNIA OF THE OVARY. through the pectineus and dissecting off a layer of fascia derived from the muscular fascia of the obturator externus. It had passed through the obturator canal displacing, in its outward passage, the upper fibres of the obturator externus muscle. The artery lay between and was separated from the sac by a ligamentous band. The nerve lay in front. The sac contained the outer two thirds of the Tallopian tube and two inches of the ileum. The bowel was gangrenous and had given way. The round ligament passed in front, above the opening. The ovary was compressed against the wall of the pelvis immediately below the open- ing. The sac was formed of the broad ligament. Dr. Chiene’s expla- nation of the occurrence of this hernia is, ‘‘ In the broad ligament of the uterus, in health, a slight cul de sac will be observed between the round ligament and the Fallopian tube; a knuckle of bowel pressing downwards in this position had caused a separation of the layers of the broad ligament; the pressure being continued, the bowel had passed through the obturator canal, necessarily pushing before it a sac formed of the peritoneum of the broad ligament, the Fallopian tube being cai’ried into the sac along with the peritoneum. On the opjiosite side were two obturator hernise, an anterior sac formed of parietal perito- neum, the opening admitting the tip of the little finger and passing in front of the round ligament, and a posterior one, similar to that on the other side, containing the outer half of the Fallopian tube. A sketch of the parts is given. The points of interest are that it was a case of triple obturator hernia, and that in two of the herniae the sacs were formed of the peritoneum of the broad ligament. Dr. Miller gives some particulars of the patient’s clinical history. ’ He had ope- rated on her, rather less than twelve months before, for strangulated emoral hernia, successfully. At the post-mortem examination, detailed above, very little trace of this could be found. He was called to see her apin shortly before her death. He could find no hernial tumour, but she had symptoms of abdominal obstruction and was very ill. She had delayed sending as she dreaded another operation. The idea of gastrotomy suggested itself, but was dismissed owing to the patient’s great age and low condition. (‘Ed. Med. Journ.,’ Jan. 1871 601-q.') A case is noted (‘Lancet,’ June 22, 1872) under the care of Mr. dpnth ^0 symptoms to lead to the diagnosis. After SS’ ? symptoms of obstruction, a small hernia was found. De- taiiea notes are given. Hernia of the ovary.~Dv. J. Englisch describes (‘Jahrbiich. der K K Gesellsch. der Aerzte in Wien,’ 1871) three cases of ovarian hZnt and makes some remarks on the afiection.

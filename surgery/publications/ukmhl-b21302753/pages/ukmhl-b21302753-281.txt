FEVER AFTER CATHETERISil. 271 expulsive contrActions of the bladder. Particulars of a case, in a man a>t. 29, and in a girl, jet. 2^, are also given. Treatment.—‘‘ Prom the urgency and painful nature of the symptoms of this disease, it is obvious that these must be treated as they arise, though it is necessary and beneficial to use constitutional remedies. I believe opium or morphia to be most useful for the relief of pain, astringent preparations of iron and confection of blacli pepper to be most efficacious in control- ling the bleeding, and cod-liver oil and iron to be the best as constitu- tional remedies. (‘ St. Barth. Hosp. Eep.,’ viii, 95.) Fatal, urethral fever after catheterism.—Mr. W. M, Banks writes on this subject. The attacks may come on very quickly after slight inter- ference with the urethra, and may terminate fatally in a few hours, or may be deferred for a longer period, and death may not ensue for several days. The aifection is essentially due to some shock to the nervous system, _ possibly the sympathetic, nervous system. An interesting feature is the non-secretion of urine in many cases. The patients retain consciousness. He mentions a case in which a man died in a few minutes after the passage of a catheter. He quotes the cases he has found recorded in the medical journals for the last twenty-five years, and details a typical case in which, after successive trials on different days with small bougies, at last a Ho. 4 metallic bougie was passed into ^e bladder. In half an hour the man vomited, then a rigor followed. He continued to vomit, complained of pain in the region of the bladder and loins j the pulse became quicker. In six hours and a half he had a sort of convulsive tremor, his appearance altered, he became uncon- scious, and died in a few minutes. The autopsy revealed no special lesions. (‘Ed. Med.

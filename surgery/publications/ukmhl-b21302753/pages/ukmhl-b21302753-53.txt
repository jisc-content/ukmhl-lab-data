He found in very hot dry summers he was free from the affection, while he suffered from it most in warm and moist weather. One of his symptoms was insomnia, marked by a peculiar periodicity; no matter what time he went to bed he could get no sleep before half-past three or four o’clock; after that time he slept soundly till seven or eight. ‘ Grueneau de Mussy (‘ Sur la Ehino-bronchite spasmodique ou fi^vre de foin;’ ‘ Gaz. Hebd.,’ 1872, ix, 9) insists on its relation to gout. He thinks that hay fever represents a process taking place upon the mucous membrane of the nose and bronchi, akin to certain eruptions observed on the skin of gouty patients. In support of his view he gives ten cases where individuals who had either had gout themselves, or in whose families gouty affections were frequent, were attacked with hay fever regularly every summer, the attacks alternating in part with the attacks of gout. Several times afterwards an exanthem, an urticaria or a pity- riasis appeared on the head, and extended to the cavities of the nose and mouth. Berber (‘ Arch, de Heilk.,’ xii, 555), in referring to Helmholtz’s ex- perience (see last ‘ Biennial Eep.,’ 51), finds the same good effects from the employment of a solution of quinine, but is inclined to look upon the affection not as due to the presence of parasites, but as a neurosis of the vagus allied to whooping-cough.

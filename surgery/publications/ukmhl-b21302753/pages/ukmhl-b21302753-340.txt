830 EEPORT ON SURGERY. supply of blood is exhausted, and to avoid injecting air. If the funnel is held up, the blood will usually flow; if not, the hand-ball can be used. (Am. Journ. Med. Sciences, Jan. 1872, 105.) _ Dr. Winants records a case in which he employed transfusion. The carotid artery of a lamb was opened to supply the blood, which was not defibrinated. The patient decidedly rallied, and survived for a fort- night. At the time he appeared moribund. (Ibid, Jan. 1872, io8.) _ Dr. Aveling records a successful case of immediate transfusion in hemorrhage after parturition. A man employed as coachman furnished the blood. A tube was inserted into a vein in his arm, and the india- rubber portion of the apparatus filled with water affixed, another tube having been inserted into a vein in the patient’s arm, as was thought. It proved to be only in the cellular tissue, and was then properly inserted. Sixty drachms of blood were injected. The patient recovered com- pletely. A diagram of the whole method of operating is given. A bevel-pointed, silver tube is inserted into a vein of the patient, and this tube is'filled with water, and the thumb is kept on the open end._ An assistant prepares the blood-donor’s arm, and inserts a round-pointed tube in a direction towards the fingers. An india-rubber tube with a ball in the middle and a tap at either end is filled with water and fitted to the two tubes. The taps are turned on, the india-rubber tube com- nressed on the donor’s side of the ball, and the ball squeezed to send the water on into the patient’s vein. Next the tube is compressed on the other side of the ball, and the latter filled. The process is repeated as at first. Defibrination is not necessary.

Theie w^s a iLge opening, through which three fingers could be easily intro- d^Ld into the nasfl cavity, fortunately the soft parts constituting the tip of the nose remained intact, and the tissues around the opening anneared healthy. Mr. Stokes adopted a modification of several pio- cSures. He made two triangular flaps, with their apices above, at t nasal nrocess of the os frontis and their bases below and having fieely vivified the edge of the large, oval-shaped opening he transplanted the fwn +riT.n?ular flaps towards the middle line so as completely to coyer Ito liid Lited them in that situation with fine entomobgist • ^ /I P'lass silk sutures.

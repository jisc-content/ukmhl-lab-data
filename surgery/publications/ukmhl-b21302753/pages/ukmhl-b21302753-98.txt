REPOllT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. 88 The same author (ib., 1871, ii, 430) reports two cases of the power of siugiug existing in two aphasic boys of the ages of ten and eiglit years. Bacon (ib., 488) reports the case of an idiot boy, set. 12, with strong family history of physical degeneration, who, scarcely able to use a single word, has a certain capacity of humming tunes. Down (ib., 1871, i, 832) records the case of a man set. 28, who had right-sided hemiplegia, with unaffected speech, and an aortic obstruc- tive murmur. A week later he became speechless, and two days after- wards died. The autopsy showed,.in addition to the aortic disease, a softened cavity of irregular shape, and of about the size of a hazel nut, in the anterior lobe of the left side of the brain.

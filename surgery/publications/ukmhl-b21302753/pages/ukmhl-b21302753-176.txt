Sci.,’ Ixi, 159) gives the following case. A man, at. 45, of very intemperate habits, first noticed haemorrhage from the bowels in the early part of 1870. This recurred from time to time, the last time in August of that year, when there was such rapid haemor- rhage into the stomach and bowels as to prove fatal in one hour. There was no vomiting at any time. At the autopsy marked but not extreme cirrhosis of the liver was found; the stomach and intestines contained a large amount of blood, which had entered them through an opening in the ductus communis choledochus. A probe passed through this open- ing directly entered a cavity in the head of the pancreas, which was filled with fluid blood and clots. Prom a microscopical examination of the head of the gland, which was enlarged and hardened, it was con- cluded that the specimen was a well-marked case of cirrhosis of the pancreas. Affections of the Peritoneum. Habershon (‘Guy’s Hosp. Eep.,’ xvi, 418) gives two cases which show that abdominal pain may be due to old^ adhesions between the stomach and transverse colon. Both become limited in their movements, and whenever the one or the other becomes distended, pain is the result. In the flrst case, that of a man, aged nearly 60, there had been fixed pain in the region of the gall-bladder, without jaundice; death occurred from hemorrhage. Old and firm adhesions were found between the liver, stomach, colon, and duodenum. The gall-bladder contained five irregular small calculi. In the second case, also a man of 60, the same pain without iaundice was present; the patient passed a considerable number of biliary calculi, and digital examination gave the idea that the duodenum and colon were adherent to the transverse colon and to the stomach. The patient recovered. . , , , Giles (‘Brit. Med. Journ.,’ 1871, 1, 447) between gonorrhoea and peritonitis in women. He thinks that the gonorrhoeal matter may readily come into f toneal membrane through the Fallopian tubes. After childbirth or ^ carriage this occurs with greater freedom, and in prostitutes ^^eglected gonorrhoea, though with less facility, may m the same manner lead to Lritonitis. The^disease differs from puerperal peritonitis in its shortei duration and its usuaUy successful termination. He gives a few cases Dob^o?

93 TUMOUllS OF BRAIN. Evans (ibid., 1872, i, 366) refers to the oecurrence of an hydatid cyst protrudinf^ from the under surface of the cerebellum in a boy set. 17,^ who in addition to rheumatic endocarditis had headache, dimness ot vision, and a staggering gait. , . . • • n . Pullar (ibid., 312) records a case of the same kind in a girl aet. 4* The cyst, the size of a pigeon’s egg, lay upon the crus cerebelli of the left side. She had periodical headache, tremors oi the limbs, and later was in a semi-unconscious state, from which she was easily roused. (And see this Eeport, under “ Animal Parasites.”) Janeway and Teakle (‘ New York Med. Eecord,’ vi, 403) give a description of tumours attached to the dura mater. Edes (‘Amer. Journ. of Med. Sci.,’ Ixi, 87) gives three cases of morbid growth connected with the nervous system, all occurring in women, whose ages respectively were 83, 60, and 71. In the first there was a gliomatous tumour of the cerebrum ; in the second a round-celled sar- coma of the cerebellum ; and in the third there was sarcoma of the semilunar ganglion of the sympathetic, varying in character from a cellular to a fibrous structure.

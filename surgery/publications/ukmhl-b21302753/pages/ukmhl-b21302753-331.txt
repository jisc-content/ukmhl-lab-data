t’OREIGN BODIES IN TlIE LARYNX TRACHEOTOMY. B21 but tracheotomy was performed high up. Something was felt, and on cutting through the cricoid cartilage a dress-hook was found attached to one of the vocal cords. After much trouble the hook was removed. The child died on the seventh day, probably owing to the damage neces- sarily caused by the removal of the awkwardly and firmly fixed hook. The patient was in the Ormond Street Hospital. (‘ Lancet,’ SeiDt. 30 1871,468.) ’ A case in which a foreign body was removed from the larynx of a child eight years old is recorded by Dr. Bennett. The child had swal- lowed a plum-stone. _ Tracheotomy was performed, but the stone could not be found, notwithstanding careful search with probes by himself and Mr. Butcher. After some days it was clear it was impacted be- tween the cords. The thyroid cartilage was divided and the stone removed, about three weeks after the child first came under care. The child recovered voice, &c. (‘ Dub. Quart. Journ.,’ Aug. 1871, 29.) Mr. Teake records the case of a man who, while drinking, sucked a Urn opiate of hone into his larynx. Examined with the laryngoscope the bone was seen to be a long, thin piece, impacted between the thyroid cartilage in front and the arytenoid behind. It was seized with forceps y VLr. leale, but it could not be removed. Tracheotomy was then periormed. Representations of the bone are given. ("‘Brit Med Journ.,’Jan. 7, 1871, 7.) v • • Mr. Stokes says, “ As I am not aware of any case in which the difii- cult and hazardous operation of tracheotomy, performed twice on the same subject has been recorded, the particulars of the following one must, doubtless, be considered of much surgical interest •” ihe patient was a woman, set. 30, who sufi'ered from syphilitic dis- Sormer previously she had had techeotomy periormed. I he tube was only worn a short time, the wound healed and the patient became free from all laryngeal distress. Six weeks previously the^ difficulty of breathing had returned. A second operation beck s double tracheotomy-hook of great service. She continued to wear a tube afterwards (‘ Dub. Jouru. Med. Sci.,’ Dec isTaTe ) .Dr. Buchanan, in the ‘ Brit. Med.

155 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH. Btomacb, and occupied both the anterior and posterior aspect. There were no nodules in the liver itself, but some enlarged glands had ex- erted pressure upon the bile-ducts, and had caused the jaundice noticed durin<^life. In the third case, a man, let. 44, there was the most ex- tensive ulceration of the stomach, by which the pyloric valve was destroyed. For some weeks before death the vomiting, which had existed at first, ceased almost altogether. _ Mayer (‘Deut. Arch,,’ ix, 105) gives a case in which softening ot the stomach occurred during life. The patient was a man, set. 37, who had been at a former period under treatment for stricture ot the cardia. He was suddenly seized with symptoms of perforation^ after b^^ing taken a large quantity of new beer in a state ot fermentation, and black bread. A few hours after the symptoms first set in, the liver dulr^s had disappeared, and in six hours and a half the patient was dead. The post-mortem examination showed a rent, 9 centimetres long, in the fundus of the stomach, with extensive brown softening, the cavity of the peritoneum distended with gas, and the contents of the stomach; the latter covered the coils of intestine in more or less thick layers. Mayer agrees with HofTmann as to the pathological process which takes place, and which the latter writer believes to consist in haemorrhagic infiltration of the walls of the stomach, and their solution from the efiect of tlie acid contents of the organ.

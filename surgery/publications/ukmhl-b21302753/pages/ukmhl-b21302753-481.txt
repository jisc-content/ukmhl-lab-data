* ‘ Journ. of Anat. and Physiol.,’ 1872, p. 134. 471 DIGITALIS. (i) Thcat after the iujectiou of a large dose of digitalm (o-o^ gram.) into the veins the pulse becomes very slow, then quicker, and then slow attain. The first slowing of the pulse is cpsed by the digitalm acting dfrectlv on the vagus roots, and stimulating them; the quickening is caused by the drug paralysing the ends of the vagus in the heart, and, at the same time, stimulating the accelerating nerves. The second slowing is due to paralysis of the muscular substance ot the heart. (2) Lai’o-e doses of digitalin increase the pressure of blood in the arteries by causing contraction of the arterioles. It does not cause them to con- tract by stimulating the vasor-motor centre in the medulla oblongata, but by acting on the ends of the vaso-motor nerves in the vessels or on the muscular fibres in their walls. (3) It lessens the temperature of the interior of the body and increases that of the surface. It probably does this by quickening the circulation through the skin. Lauder Brunton and A. B. Meyer * bring forward a new proof that digitalin causes contraction of the arterioles. They find that the blood pressure rises after its injection, but the pulse wave becomes smaller. This shows that the rise is not caused by the heart. At the^ same time each wave descends more gradually, showing that the blood js escaping morAslowly through the arterioles. As the blood pressure is high, the slow flow of the blood through the arterioles can only be caused by their contraction. The pulse is rendered slow. This is partly due to the increased blood pressure.

Hop.,’ 1871, 425) gives a general sketch of the atfection, claiming for Demours the first description of it in 1818. He considers the afiiection to be a nervine one, accompanying lesion of the sympathetic nerve, such as Lancereaux and Peter found in one case in the hypertrophy and hypersemia of the inferior cervical ganglion. He thinks the pro- trusion of the eye is due to the contraction of the small muscles in Tenon’s capsule, supplied by that nerve. Emmert (“ Historische notiz fiber Morbus Basedowi, nebst Referat fiber 20 selbst beobachtete Palle dieser Krankheit,” ‘ Arch. f. Ophthal.,’ xvii, 203) gives the first description to an Englishman (‘ Col- lections from the unpublished writings of the late C. H. Parry,’ 1825). Meyer (‘Berk Klin. Woch.,’ 1872, 468) gives four cases of this affection in females in which good results were obtained by galvanizing the cervical sympathetic.

Animal Parasites. TJdhe (‘Yirch. Arch.,’ lii, 439) gives a table showing that of 87,111 pigs killed in the duchy of Brunswick, from Easter 1868 to 1869, six only were found to have trichinae. Petri (ib., 440) gives another table of all the pigs (5688) slaughtered at Rostock in 1870: one only was found afiected (cf. last ‘Report’). In the ‘ Second Annual Report of State Board of Health in Massa- chusetts’ (1871) may be found (p. 46) a report on “ Trichina Disease in Massachusetts.” The history and symptoms of the affection are given, and an account of outbreaks of it in 1870, one in Saxonville and the other in Lowell. In the first, three out of a family of six, who had eaten underdone fresh fried pork, were attacked, two boys, set. 14 and 19, and their sister set. 17. The eldest boy died with symptoms of typhoid fever. In the second case—badly reported—a mother and four children ate portions of raw smoked ham {i. e. not even slightly cooked, as the father took it) and became affected. Living trichinse were found in fragments of the ham examined. As to prevention—a tem- perature of 150° to 160° E. is fatal to the trichina. Pickling may and does probably render the pork harmless, smoking does not. Uncooked pork muscle, i. e. the lean portion (for trichinso are not harboured in the fat), can never be eaten with safety.

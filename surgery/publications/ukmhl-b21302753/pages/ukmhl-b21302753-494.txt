Tor many years some of the ablest of our metropolitan physicians failed to detect the true cause of the un- healthiuess of MiUbank prison, and assigned various causes for it which later experience has proved to be unconnected with it. Enteric fever was rife from time to time in the gaol. In the year 1854, however, the water supply was changed with the best possible results. Pre- viously, the water used for drinking purposes in the prison was pumped direct from the Thames, but was- of course filtered before use. The water used for domestic purposes is now supplied by the artesian well in Trafalgar Square. The change was carried into effect in ^ the midst of the cholera epidemic which was then so severely visiting London, and the prison was suflFering from cholera at the time. Six days after the change the disease suddenly ceased, and a marked improvement took place in the health of the prisoners. Erom the date of the introduction of the new water supply up to April 1872, a period of nearly 19 years, there have been only three deaths from enteric fever, viz. one in 18^5, one in i860, and one 1865. Mr. De Eenzy thinks that the sanitary history of Millbank—which he gives in detail—appears to warrant the following conclusions : I. That the extinction of enteric fever, and other diseases of the saine class, is quite within the range of practicability. 2. That the extinction of one class of zymotic leases is not necessarily followed by zymotic diseases of a different class. Eor example :—It is sujiposed that the increased prevalence of scarlatina and measles of late years is due to the partial displacement of smallpox by vaccination. The case of Millbank shows that it is practicable to protect a community against every kind of zymotic disease. Ignorance of sanitary science is the great obstacle to the extension of this protection to the free population. 3. That since some of the ablest physicians in London failed for many years to detect the true cause of the unhealthiness of Millbank Prison, and assigned causes for it which later experience has found to be unconnected with it, the probability is that a similar error is frequently made elsewhere, and that the prevalence of some zymotic disease is ascribed to locality, faialaria, heat, cold, variations of temperature, moral depression, and other intangible inffuences which would be entirely removed by the general disuse of impure water. 4. That as it required long years of observation to establish the noxious infiuence of Thames water in Millbank, even when well filtered, under conditions very favorable for detection, we should be

The autopsy showed turbid fluid with translucent granulations about the interpeduncular space; injection of tlie pia mater, optic commissure and tracts. The nerves presented large super- ficial vessels along their entire length. Close to the eyeball they swelled out into a kind of bulb, due to distension of the outer sheath of the optic nerve by fluid. There were no tubercles in any of the other organs.

He com- plained of numbness of the right arm and leg, but had perfect motion. He had also paralysis of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Jastrowitz (‘Arch. f. Psych.,’ ii, 389, and hi, 162) has studied the hereditary character of nervous diseases, taking as his starting-point the occurrence, pointed out by Virchow, of a diffuse encephalitis in new- born children. In the two years preceding his article he examined the brains of a large number of children who had died with head symptoms (tetanus, trismus, &c.). The result in all the cases showed an encepha- litis agreeing completely with Virchow’s description ; hypersemia of the meninges and white substance, comparative paleness of the cortical substance, whitish-yellow spots in the white substance corresponding to places in which the fatty change was most advanced in the cells of the neuroglia. He gives a full account of the changes found; the spinal cord was scarcely, if at all, aflected. To decide the question whether this so-called encephalitis was a pathological condition, he then ex- amined the brains of apparently healthy newborn children, who had died from other causes. Of 80 which he examined, 7 were foetuses of five to seven months, 37 children from that period to the age of one (extra-uterine) week ; 12 from one week to five months; 4 from five to nine months; 5 from nine months to three years. All the 37 children presented_ the changes described in the brain. In foetnses the fatty degeneration of the cerebral substance was general; in children it was partial. The first child that presented no change in its brain was five months old. Irom these and further premises, for the study of which the original article must be referred to, he concludes that this fatty metamorphosis in the brain is a normal process, consisting in changes in the young celk of the neuroglia. He discusses at some length the etiology of the affection. Elam ( Lancet,’ 1871, i, 747) gives a table of the chief differences

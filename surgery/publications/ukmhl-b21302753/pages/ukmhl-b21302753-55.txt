The patient, a soldier, set. 21, had suffered from the latter affection in 1866, while m Cochin China. The attacks recurred every three or four days, while he was in Belgium, after the battle of Sedan, and again in 1871. At this latter period, without any paralysis of the face or limbs, the attacks were accompanied by an aphasia which returned at regular intervals. The same thing had happened during the former attacks of ague. Bazin (‘ Gaz. desHop.,’ 1871, 286) gives a case of intra-uterine ague. The mother was suffering from tertian ague at the time of her confine- ment, and gave birth to a female child during one of the attacks. Nearly a month later, and for some time afterwards, the child had regularly every night attacks of coldness and paleness, yawned, and stretched its limbs, and a little later became red and burning hot, its respiration increasing in frequency; it then fell into a sleepy condition, during which it refused the breast; towards morning the heat left it, and it again resought its natural food. At the same time there was great enlargement of the spleen and oedema of the feet, face, eyelids, &c. He calls attention to the latter, which he considers a great aid in the diagnosis of ague in young children (!). Longhi, “Della Malaria e delle Febri Intermittente,” ‘Gaz. Med. Lomb.,’ 1872, 253.

Journ.,’ xvii, 201) gives some notes on cases of yellow fever, which occurred between September, 1868, and January, 1870, in the usually very healthy island of St. Kitt’s. All the evidence he has been able to collect inclines him strongly to the correctness of the “ infection theory,” though he does not reject the idea that it can also originate de novo. He believes, indeed, that the first of the cases he gives probably arose in this way, the atmospheric and bad hygienic con- ditions which surrounded it acting as causes. The first case was that

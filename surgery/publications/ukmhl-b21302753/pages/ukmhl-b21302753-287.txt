277 LITHOTOMY, lateral lithotomy. Ho could not extract the stone. He then made a supra-pubic incision and removed the stone by that means. It weighed four and a half ounces. The patient recovered. (‘ Edin. Med. Jouim.,’ Dec. 1871, 557.) Lithotomy; hcemorrhaye.—A case, in a lad, set. 15, operated on by lateral lithotomy, in which haemorrhage occurred on the sixth day, and recurred till the eleventh is noted by Mr. Square. The bleeding came on and ceased suddenly. Lancet,’ May ii, 1872, 648.) In the ease of a boy, aet. 4.^, under the care of the present compiler, haemorrhage occurred on the fifth day. There had been no previous complication ; the bleeding came on quite suddenly, after he had had a violent fit of passion and crying; it was so severe as to produce rather alarming faintness, ceased as suddenly as it came on, and did not appa- rently hinder the child’s progress in any way. Lithotomy.—A paper on Lithotomy in Lndia will be found in ‘Dub. Quart. Jouru.’ (May, 1871, 311), by Dr. Curran. Pour cases in which the stones were of unusuallij large size are narrated by Mr. Teevan (‘ Clin. Soc. Trans.,’ iv, 84). An analysis of statistics of lateral lithotomy by Dr. Keith is continued and completed by the account of the fatal cases in the ‘Brit. Med. Journ.,' Sept. 16 and 23, 1871. Seven cases are recorded by Mr. Ensor, of South Africa. Notwithstanding the frequency of hmma- turia and of renal calculi, vesical calculus is rare (‘Lancet,’ Jan. 27, 1872, 112). Professor Erichsen gives an interesting clinical lecture on several cases on which he operated for yerarrewi; or multiple calculi (‘Lancet,’ March 18, 1871, 360). A clinical lecture on lithotomy, by Dr. Eben Watson, is given in the ‘Lancet,’ May 4 1872 • ® 47 patients operated on by him two only died; he uses Buchanan’s rectangular stafE. A clinical lecture, by Professor Humphrey, is given in the ‘ Lancet,’ June i, 1872, and one by Mr. Forster on lithotomy and litliotrity in the ‘Lancet’ Oct 26 1872. ’ ■ ’ Ritpure of the female bladder.—W. Stokes, in a clinical lecture on rupture of the female bladder, says he could only find notes of five cases (m Mr. Hoiiel’s memoir). Two others occurred under the care ot colleagues of his own, and he adds one case. The patient survived six days and fifteen hours. The rupture was at the anterior part of the lundus. He discusses the diagnosis. He mentions two cases, recorded ot recovery after rupture of the male bladder. (‘ Brit. Med Journ ’ March 23, 1872.) ’ Wotmd of the bladder in fracture of the pelvis ; recovery.—Dr. Bell showed a lad who had fractured his pelvis. When he came under care he could only pass water through a wound on the left side of the abdomen A probe went straight into the bladder. Ho catheter could be passed. IS was at last accomplished. No more urine came through the fistula and the latter healed. Another case was mentioned where the fistula was on the other side. (Edin. Med. Journ.,’ Oct. 1872.) LUhotomy; removal of apiece of bone from the bladder.—Henrv • case of a patient on whom he operated for stone mthe bladder and removed a calculus which proved to be bone e™ rusted with phosphates.

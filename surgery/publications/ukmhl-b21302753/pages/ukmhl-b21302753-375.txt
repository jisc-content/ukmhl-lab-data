365 MEDICINE AND THEEAPEUTICS. an eye which required for the definition of the test objects ten times as much light as a normal eye, would have a retinal sensibility only one tenth as great. It follows that, if li be the minimum of light necessary for a normal eye, and h the minimum for a diseased eye, that X, = A normal eye distinguishes the objects when Ti—i sq. mm. If, H then, we take a sq. mm. to be = i, and express H by half its actual value, the value of n will always be a fraction having i for its nume- rator. The annexed table gives the mean results of the examination in a large number of diseases.

In the first, from Nos. I to 7 inclusive the retinal sensibility is very little diminished. In the second, from 8 to 12, it is very considerably diminished, so much so that in many cases the full opening of 1500 square millimetres was yet insufB-cient. The author called attention to the fact that the morbid processes of the former group were such as to affect chiefly the conduct- ing portions of the visual apparatus, such as the fibrous and ganglionic layers of the retina, the optic nerve as far as the brain, and perhaps the brain itself, while those of the latter affected chiefly the choroid and the perceptive layer of the retina. Glaucoma had been omitted from the table on account of the variableness of the results. In inflamma- tory cases, and during the premonitory stage of cases of a certain degree ot acuteness, the visual sense was much diminished. In chronic cases the results differed greatly. Some observations followed on the value of this examination as a means of diagnosis, e.g in negativing the suspicion of retinal detach- ment in a case of turbid vitreous, in which L retained a high value ; and in determining the cure of syphilitic affections of the choroid. The author also used his instrument to discover whether a scotoma was

Mil.,’ xxvi, 43) gives the following case:—'A soldier, set, 29, had two years before had. an attack of dyspnoea, which lasted two hours, and was followed by oedema of the neck and face. On May ii, 1870, he had another suffocative attack. He had been revaccinated on the 4th; on the loth his conjunctivse were slightly injected, next day the dyspnoea com- menced, with a feeling of diflB.culty in swallowing.

Later, oedema of the right hand and upper lip was succeeded by oedema of the right foot and lower lip. The symptoms disappeared, and the patient recovered. In the absence of any cause to be discovered in an affection of the heart or kidneys, Boelt ascribes the sudden occurrence of the oedema, which was unac- companied by any symptoms of inflammation, to hypersemia due to paralysis of the vascular branches of the sympathetic nerves. Russell (‘Glasg. Med. Journ.,’ 1871, iii, 209) reproduces an already published case of laryngeal obstruction, preceded by erysipelas, in a wciman set. 21. Tracheotomy was performed, but the obstruction still exists and the patient still wears the eanula. He gives a second case of the same kind, occurring in a female, set. 18, attacked with typhus. Nothing abnormal was revealed by the laryngoscope about the epiglottis or vocal corcis. The laryngeal obstruction became so severe that tracheotomy was performed, and the patient was relieved. Later, the obstruction still re-

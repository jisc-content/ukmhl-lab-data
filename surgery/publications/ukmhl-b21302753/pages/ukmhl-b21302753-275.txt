265 TREPHINING POE GUNSHOT. ing 215 grammes (more than ounces). (‘ Qaz. Med. de Paris,’ 21 Oct. 1871.) Trephining for Gunshot.—A case is recorded in which a soldier was wounded in the forehead by a bullet. After ten days “a spot was discovered, a little to the right of the occipital protuberance, that was j)aiuful when touched, and had the appearance of being a very slight portion of the occipital bone forced by some power from within out- ward.” The wound in front was examined more carefully. The frontal bone had received a fracture of both tables, but in such a manner as to allow the piece or pieces to spring into place again. A probe was passed into this wound outwards to the “ back part of the head in the im- mediate neighbourhood of the lesion of the occipital bone, where it met a hard, convex substance.” The occipital bone was then trephined, and a bullet extracted. The man recovered. (‘ Am. Journ. Med. Sciences,’ Jan. 1872, 120.) Dr. Halstead records (‘ St. Louis Med. and Surg. Journal,’ March, 1870) the case of a man, set. 17, who was shot in the head by the breech-pin of his gun. The pin struck his forehead, smashed in the bone, and stuck into the brain. The man pulled it out himself and then rode on horseback for some distance. He afterwards became in- sensible. Pieces of bone were found driven for two inches into the brain. _ As many as thirty-eight pieces were removed, and also a three- fourth inch screio. It was supposed that the breech-pin passed nearly to the petrous bone, a distance of four and a half inches, it is said, from the forehead, tearing the falx cerebri and opening the superior, louo-i- tudinal sinus in its passage. The injuries, &c., are described in detail. The man wholly recovered. He was not in any respect aware of any difference, three months later, in his mental or physical condition, from that before the accident. (‘Am. Journ. Med. Sciences,’ Jan i8vi 301.) ■ ‘ ’ Dr. Howard narrates the following case in detail. On April 6 1862, a soldier, set. 19, was shot in the head by a Minie ball He staggered, fell back, and remained insensible till the next day. On April 9 he was found sitting up, leaning against a tree, and sensible. Un April 15 he was carefully examined. There was a wound in the lett temple, and a probe passed obliquely across the most prominent part ot the forehead and emerged through a small incised wound, said to have been made by a surgeon who extracted a ball, which the patient hZ. 1 r?? ^ depression in the frontal boue._ The left leg was numb.

134 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. cotics if sleeplessness or pain be present. In a second class the cardiac disease consists in imperfection of tbe mitral valve, and its necessary- results ; here the treatment is to be directed to the lungs, liver and kidneys; narcotics have only a transient benefit, often folio-wed by increased distress. In a third class the dyspnoea is produced by failing muscular power of the heart, due to degeneration of its muscular fibre, atheroma of the vessels, idiopathic anaemia, disease of the aortic valves and dilatation. Here stimulating narcotics should be used—spirit of chloroform, camphor, senega, ammonia and Indian hemp. The paper contains suggestions as to the general dietary regulations to be fol- lowed, and concludes with the writer’s experience of various drugs employed by himself.

While Ivine in bed she became suddenly unconscious, and had occa- Xnal muscular twitchings of the right limbs. The right pupil was contracted, the left dilated, both immovable.

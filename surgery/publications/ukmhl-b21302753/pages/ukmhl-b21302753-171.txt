LIVER—ATROPHY—CIRRHOSIS. 161 of the Hver in a woman aged 22. The symptoms were icterus, black vomit, coma, suppression of urine; death occurred after six days. The liver weighed 2 lbs. 8 ounces. Porter (‘Amer. Journ. Med. Sci.,’ Ixi, 409) gives notes of a case of the same kind in a merchant aged 23, with an account of the post- mortem appearances found. Clements (‘ Brit. Med. Journ.,’ 1871, i, 367) records the following;— A girl, aged 17, previously in good health, became jaundiced, and com- plained of drowsiness. She then had persistent vomiting and became delirious, and died comatose. The autopsy showed all the organs healthy except the liver, which weighed only 13 ounces. Not a trace of hepatic cells could be found under the microscope. Goodridge (ib., 609) gives the case of a man, aged 20, in whom acute atrophy of the Hver complicated early secondary syphilis. Here the liver weighed only 30^ ounces, and hardly a trace of hepatic cells could be found.

Olivier J“Memoire pour servir a I’histoire de la Cirrhose hyper- trophique. Union Med., xii, 361) gives a case of cirrhosis of the liver in a man, act 22, a wine-seUer. He had been a hard drinker since the age of 13 ; at the age of 18 he noticed that his belly was swollen • he ^d great digestive derangement, vomiting, epistaxis, and iaundice His hver was enormously increased in size, extending to the umbilicus and to the spleen which was also enlarged. After death the liver was foimd to weigh 2-830 grammes, and was markedly cirrhosed the inter- lobular tissue having undergone considerable hypertrophy. The spleen and kidneys were also increased in size. The writer diseases the fues^ tion of cirrhosis, collecting several cases of the affection in which the hver was enlarged, from other authors. He concludes that hypertrophic cmrhosis is a definite affection, not the first stage of an^iLomnlete cirrhosis It m more rare than the form in which the Hver is Xphie^ Like it, it IS characterised anatomically by chronic proliferation of the 1st; but 1 Bub^tat frllot 11

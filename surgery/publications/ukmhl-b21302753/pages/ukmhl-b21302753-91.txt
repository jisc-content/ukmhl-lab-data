81 CHOREA. Chorea. Handfield Joues (‘Med. Press and Circ.,’ 1872, i, 24) records five cases of chorea ; in one girl £et. 7 years, and two, set. 13, in each of whom the aftection lasted six weeks ; in a girl of 18, in whom its dura- tion was doubtful, and in whom there was a curious mingling of motor and mental disorders; and in one boy set. 10 years, in whom its dura- tion was about eleven weeks. These cases illustrate the following points, (i) The tendency of chorea proper—motor centre disorder— to be attended with an analogous state of the emotional or of the intel- lectual centres ; (2) its liability to occur in a modified form, and to be complicated with quasi-epileptic attacks ; (3) the absence of rheumatism or definite endocarditis in all the cases; (4) the varying duration and causation of chorea; (5) the certainty that the same remedy is not suitable to all cases ; (6) the increased excretion of urinary solids which not unfrequently occurs in chorea. Butlin communicates to the ‘Lancet’ (1871, ii, 576, 606) twelve cases of chorea in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years, treated with sulphate of zinc. Gray and Tuckwell (ib., ii, 778) give a series of eighteen cases, six under the observation of the former, and twelve under that of the latter. In none of these was any special treatment adopted from the first onset to the complete disappearance of the symptoms, calculated to influence the nervous system. Good diet, the better hygienic conditions of the infirmary, and peppermint water were the only means employed. The cases show well how remarkably chorea is liable to vary in its duration. The most protracted case in Gray’s list lasted twenty weeks, the shortest six weeks; the longest of Tuckwell’s cases seventeen w^eeks, the shortest six weeks. The average duration of Gray’s six cases is ten weeks and one day ; of TuckwelTs twelve cases, ten weeks and three days. These averages have a remarkable identity with the results obtained by the use of various drugs. Gray finds the average of seven cases, taken at random, and treated with arsenic, steel, &c., to be ten weeks and two days. The mean duration of eight cases treated in succession by Tuckwell with arsenic in gradually increasing doses, after Begbie’s plan, was ten weeks and six days; the longest case lasting sixteen, the shortest seven weeks. Hillier puts the mean duration of thirty cases at “ about ten weeks.” See gives sixty-nine days as the average dura- tion of 117 cases. Buzzard (‘Brit. Med. Journ.,’ 1872, i, 342) showed to the Clinical Society a female ast. 25, with atrophy of the right side of her face, alter chorea.

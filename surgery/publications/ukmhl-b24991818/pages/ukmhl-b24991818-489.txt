473 CHAPTER III. Excision of the Eye-Ball. lustriiiuciits required.—Eye speculum; strabismus hook ; strabismus scissors; toothed forceps ; blunt-ended scissors curved on the flat ; small sponges. The Operation.—The patient’s head is a little raised, and the surgeon stands in front, facing the patient. The speculum is introduced between the lids and opened. With the blunt-pointed scissors the surgeon snips through the conjunctiva just behind the corneal margin. The toothed forceps are used to pick up the membrane and to steady the globe. The division of the conjunctiva is complete all round. By the further use of the scissors Tenon’s capsule is freely opened, and each of the rectus tendons is then picked up in turn with the strabismus hook, and is divided close to the sclerotic with the strabismus scissors. It is convenient to begin with the e.xternal rectus, then to divide the superior and inferior recti, and to finish with the inner rectus. If the speculum be now pressed back into the cavity of the orbit, the eye-ball starts forwards, The blunt-ended scissoi’s curved on the flat are then introduced into the orbit to the outer side of the globe, and are carried back until the optic nerve is reached. It is divided by one cut of the blades. The eye-ball being drawn forwards with the fingers, the ’ oblique muscles are divided, together with any soft parts which may still hold the globe in place. A piece of Turkey sponge is then pressed into the cavity of the orbit, and is allowed to remain there for a few minutes. I'he first dressing consists merely of an aseptic sponge pressed into the cavity of the orbit over the closed eyelids, and retained in position by a pad and bandage. This is

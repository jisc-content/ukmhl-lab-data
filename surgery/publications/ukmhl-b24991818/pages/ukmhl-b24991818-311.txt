CHAP. II.] EXCISION OF THYROID BODY. 295 The tumour is now almost completely isolated, and the last step consists in ligaturing the inferior thyroid artery. Enucleation.—When a goitre consists of a localised cyst or adenoma, it may be enucleated by peeling off the surrounduig glands by means of an elevator. Care must be taken that the incision goes down into the actual wall of the tumour, and the size of the latter may often be diminished by tapping before it is shelled out. A formal ligature of the main thyroid vessels is not required, but all vessels going into the tumour should be secured with pressure forceps before division. Mr. Berry recommends in these cases a transverse incision placed low down in the neck, as the resulting scar will be less conspicuous than a vertical or oblique one. The transverse incision, however, does not give so much room as the others. Tlie Qncfiition of Tcaclicotoiny in these Operations.—If there be much dyspnoea in these cases of excision of the thyroid, the mass should be relieved from its tense surroundings as soon as possible, and the pressure removed from the trachea. Some assistance in this direc- tion may be afforded by altering the position of the head, and by having the mass, as far as possible, withdrawn from the windpipe. IMore immediate relief may be obtained probably by dividing the isthmus. Tracheotomy is most emphatically to be avoided. Tlio operation, if performed, would be carried out under the greatest difficulties, and the gravity of the whole procedure much increased.

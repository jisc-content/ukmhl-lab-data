230 CHAPTER Vm. Excision of the Shoulder. The operation known by this name consists really of an excision of the upper.end of the humerus. The shoulder- joint is not excised—or, in other words, that portion of the scapula which supports the glenoid fossa is not sawn away with the articular segment of the humerus. Portions of bone may be gouged from the glenoid fossa, but more than that is seldom done. The operation is comparatively rarely performed, and the conditions under which it is carried out are the same as lead to excisions of otlier joints. In a few instances the upper end of the humerus has been removed for a new growth. To the greater tuberosity ai’e attached the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor; to the lesser process the subscapularis. 1. The Operation by an Anterior Incision.— The method here described is of the “ open method ” order. The subperiosteal opei’ation is dealt with in the section which follows. The patient lies upon the back, close,to the edge of the table, with the shoulders well raised. The elbow is flexed, and is carried a little from the side. The assistant who holds the limb sits or stands by the patient’s loins. The surgeon takes up a position to the outer side of the shoulder and faces the subject. A second assistant stands behind the shoulder, facing the operator. The bony points about the joint should be defined. (a) The Incision.—The incision, which is three and a half to four inches in length, commences at the outer side of the tip of the coracoid process, and is carried downwai’ds

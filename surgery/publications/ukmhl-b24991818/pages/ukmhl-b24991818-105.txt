AMPUTATION k\ 89 CHAP. II.] palmai’ cut. Three separate cuts with the knife are there- fore required. The incision should at first involve the skin only. The finger is now extended to its utmost, and the palmar incision is carried to the bone, the flexor tendons being thus stretched and divided. The finger being then turned to one or the other .side, the lateral incisions—on each aspect of the root of the finger—are carried to tlie bone. In this way the digital arteries are cleanly divided, and the expansions from the lumbricals and interossei are cut. The assistant now takes the finger, while the surgeon dissects back the flaps, as far as the joint-line, with the aid of forceps. The wrist and finger being fully extended, the operator once more takes hold of the digit and proceeds to open the joint from the palmar aspect. He cuts the glenoid ligament transversely against the base of the phalanx, divides the lateral ligaments, and finally completes the operation by cutting the extensor tendon. Disarticulation may be eSected from the dorsum, but it renders the section of the glenoid ligament a little less easy. The synovial sheath for the flexor tendons may be closed. The glenoid ligament remains in the stump. The two palmar digital arteries will require to bo ligatured or twisted. The cicatrix is vertical—-i.e. in the long axis of the limb. 2. By I..at€i‘al Fla|»s.—The flaps are of equal size and are a little rounded. The base of each corresponds to the joint-line, the free extremity of each to the level of the Aveb. The median dorsal cut commences just above the metacaiqio-phalangeal joint. The palmar median incision extends into the palm up to the level of that joint. The modus operandi is as follows :— The surgeon marks out both the flaps by skin incisions. He then dissects iq» one of the flaps (that to the right) until the joint is reached. This flap includes all the soft parts

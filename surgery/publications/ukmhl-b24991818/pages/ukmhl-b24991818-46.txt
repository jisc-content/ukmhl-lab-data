30 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part I. THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. Line of the Artery.—The external carotid is repre- sented by the upper part of the common carotid line. Others have proposed a line drawn from the tip of the lobule of the ear to the Fig. 13.—LIGATURE OP RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. tip of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone. Operation. — The posi- tion of the patient and of tlie oiierator should be the same as is observed in the previous operation. The “ place of election ” is represented by the ])or- tion of the vessel between the superior thyroid and lingual arteries. An incision, two and a half to three inches in length, is made in the line of the artery from a point about on a level with the middle of the thyroid car- tilage to near the angle of the jaw. The greater cornu of the hyoid bone will be about the centre of the in- cision. A, Platysma ; B, Cervical- fascia; C, Steruo-mastoid ; D, Digastric ; E, Great cornu of hyoid bone ; a, E.xterual carotid at origin of supe- rior thyroid; 6, Crossing lingual artery points to lingual vein; c, Facial artery ; d. Facial and supe- rior thyroid veins ; 1, Hypoglossal nerve. The integuments and platysma having been di- vided, and any superficial vein secux’ed, the fascia is cut through, and the an- terior border of the sterno- mastoid is exposed in the lower part of the wound. This muscle must be drawn outwards. The posterior belly of the digastric should next be sought for at the upper

The flap, moreover, contains more fatty tissue, and healing after the operation is usually a little slowâ€”a circumstance to which the occasionally horny condition of the skin and the difficulty of perfectly disinfecting it may no doubt contribute. In the palmar flap operation the incisions are carried comparatively high up upon the sides of the limb, and there is a little more disposition for the styloid processes to be exposed when the flap is adjusted.

280 [part VI. SUROIGAL OPERATIONS. lest the artery should be wounded as it leaves the posterior palatine foramen. Tlie cases of serious and so.netimes fatal hfeinorrhage following the operation have been those in which the latter accident has occurred. An additional incision will be required through the soft palate internally to the haraular process. The steps of the opcrntioii are as follows : — 1. The edges of the cleft ai’e carefully pared along its whole length on either side, the soft tissues being raised from their attachment to the hard ])alate and nasal septum. 2. One lateral incision just within the alveolar margin {see Fig. 86) is now made, and with a curved raspatory the whole of the soft tissues are carefully detached as far inwards as the edge of the cleft. At the back the raspatory is made to lift off from the bone that part of the soft palate where it joins the hard. This is best done from the cleft. The bleeding in this .stage may have been considerable ; it should be checked by pressui’e (made by the assistant Avith a sponge mounted on holder), whilst the operator proceeds to repeat the lateral incision on the opposite side. This incision is made in one case from before backwards, in the other from behind forwards. Sponge pressure will now be made on both sides, whilst the anajsthetic is resumed. The fauces need to be kept clear of blood by sponging, but this should be as sparing as possible, and done with the utmost gentleness. 3. The sutures are now introduced by one of the methods already described. The first will be passed through the soft palate at the base of the uvula. Traction made on this will steady the two halves, and ensure the others being ])laced at regular intervals. Fine silkworm-gut

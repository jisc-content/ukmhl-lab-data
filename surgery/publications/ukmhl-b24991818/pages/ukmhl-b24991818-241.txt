225 -1' CHAPTER VIL Excision of the Elbow. This operation consists in the removal of the lower end of the humerus and the upper extremities of the radius and ulna. Excision tliroiig^li a Posterior Median Incision.—The patient lies upon the back, with the body- close to the edge of the table. The surgeon stands on the side that is to be operated upon. An assistant is placed on the opposite side of the table—t.e. upon the patient’s sound side—and holds the limb. The upper arm should be vertical, or at right angles to the surface of the couch; the elbow should be a little flexed, and the forearm be carried across the patient’s chest, so that the elbow projects prominently outwards. In dealing with the right joint the operator should stand by the patient’s loins, and in dealing with the left, well to the outer side of the trunk, A second assistant, standing on the opposite side, can help to steady the limb by grasping the arm and fore- arm as he leans over the body; and a third helper, placed to the surgeon’s left, should be prepared to assist in retract- ing the divided parts. In this attitude it will be understood that the ulna and olecranon will be uppermost. NaiTow-bladed rectangular retractors made of the stoutest steel are requisite. (a) The Incision.—The skin incision is about four inches in length, is in the long axis of the forearm, and is so placed as to cross the centre of the olecranon fossa of the humerus, and to cross the centre of the olecranon process, and then follow the crest or posterior border of the ulna (f'ig. 77, B).

SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part III. 116 Tlie posterior flap is marked out with the knife in t])e same way, the arm being lifted up so that the surgeon can see the posterior surface. These incisions concern the skin only. The skin haAung been evenly freed all round, the anterior and posterior flaps are cut by transfixion, the edge of the knife being brought out at the level of the retracted skin. As already said, care must be taken neither to transfix nor to slit the brachial artery. The bone having been freed up to the saw-line,' and the flaps well drawn up, the humerus is divided, care being taken of the musculo-spiral nerve. The objections which have been urged against the cutting of the whole flap (muscles and skin) by transfixion apply with especial force to this part. The flaps so cut are cut Fig. .38.—A, Circular (inclined) ampu- without precision, and the tation of the arm ; B, Amputation muscles and skin are di- by deltoid flap. The rapidity with which the operation may be performed is its sole recommendation. Ilcemorrhage.—Some muscular arteries are divided in the anterior flap. In the posterior flap the brachial, the superior profunda, and the inferior profunda are found severed.

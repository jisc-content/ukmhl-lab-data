CHAP. XIV.] 163 AMPUTATIONS. The anterior flap should contain all the soft parts on the front of the limb. These should be carefully dissected up from the bones and from the interosseous membrane. The flap contains the anterior tibial artery in the whole of its length. The ])Osterior flap may be completed by a simple vigorous transverse cut across the back of the limb from the skin to the bones. The foot should be flexed during this manoeuvre. The Fig. 52. —STUMP LEFT AFTER TEALE’S AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. flaps having been retracted to a little beyond the saw-line, the retractors are applied, the interosseous membrane is divided, and the bones are sawn through. When the wound has been closed by sutures, the stump has the appearance shown in Fig. 52. Ucpmorrhacje.—The anterior tibial vessels are divided at the free lower end of the anterior flap, and at about its middle. The postei’ior tibial artery is found cut upon the face of the posterior flap and towai’ds its inner side, the vessel lying between the margins of the flexor longus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis. The peroneal vessels are divided on the outer part of this flap, close to the fibula, and under cover of the flexor longus pollicis. The long saphenous vein will be found in the anterior flap, the short saphenous in the posterior flap. Comment.—Inasmuch as the leg narrows towards the ankle, it is easy, by following the general lines of the limb, to make the anterior flap too narrow below.

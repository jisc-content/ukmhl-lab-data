65 CHAPTER II. 4 Operations upon the Nerves of the Head and Neck. FIRST DIVISION OF THE TRIFACIAL NERVE. Tlie Jiiii|>i'a-5>rbital Nerve.—The eyebrow is steadied by the operator’s left hand while an assistant draws the eyelid downwards. An incision about three-quarters of an inch in length is made liorizontally along the superior orbital margin in such a way that its centre will correspond to the supra-orbital notch. The integuments and orbicularis muscle having been cut through, the nerve is readily exposed. The vessels should be avoided. A vertical incision exposes more of the nerve, and is simpler, but it makes a more considerable section of the muscle and leaves a larger scar. SECOND DIVISION OF THE TRIFACIAL NERVE. • Tlie liili-a-Orbital Nerve.—This nerve may be ex- posed as it leaves the infra-orbital foramen by means of a transverse incision three-quarters of an inch in length made about a quarter of an inch below the lower mai'gin of the orbit, and so j^Hced as to cross the infra-orbital foramen. After the skin, layer of subcutaneous fat, and orbiculai’is muscle have been divided, the levator labii superioris is exposed, and must be severed in the line of the original wound. The nerve is now reached, and can be dealt with. The parts are vascular, and the view of the nerve is apt to be occluded by free bleeding. Section of the nerve at this spot cuts off merely the terminal branches to the face. Various methods have been devised for dealing with the D

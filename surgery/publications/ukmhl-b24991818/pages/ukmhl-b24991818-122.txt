106 . CHAPTER V. Amputation of the Forearm. Iiistriiiiiciits.—An amputating-knife, with a blade four to five inches in length. A stout scalpel. An amputating-saw. Retractors (the linen retractor used to protect the soft parts during the sawing of the bones may have three “ tails,” the middle and narrowest slip being passed through the interosseous space). Pressure and dis- secting forceps. Scissors, needles, etc. Position.—The arm is abducted, and the surgeon stands to the right of the limb in all cases—i.e. to the outer side of the right forearm and the inner side of the left. One assistant—to the operator’s left—steadies the upper arm and retracts the flaps, etc. The othex’—to the opera- tor’s right—manipulates the forearm and hand, and attends to the sponging, etc. The following operations ai*e desci’ibed :— 1. Circular method. 2. Anterior and posterior flaps. 1. Tlic Circular ITIetliod {through the lower third). —The cix’cular cut in the skin will be placed at a distance below the futui’e saw-line equal to the antero-posterior diameter of the limb at that line. The steps of the operation have been given on page 77. 2. By Aiifero-postcrior Flaps {through the upper tivo-thirds).—The base of each flap should be equal to half the cii'cumference of the limb at the level of the saw-line. The length of each flap will depend upon the condition of the tissues. The arterial supply is the best on the anterior surface, and the saw should always be placed on the dorsum. Hence the anterior flap may well be made the length of

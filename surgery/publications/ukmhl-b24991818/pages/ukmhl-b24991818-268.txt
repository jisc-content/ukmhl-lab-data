Blood drains away readily in this position with- out risk of its entering the trachea. The surgeon stands on the patient’s right-hand side in dealing with either side of the jaw.

While this cut is being made, an assistant may com- press the facial artery. When the lip is reached, the chief assistant grasps each extremity of the lip (at either angle of the mouth) between

75 CHAP. 111.] OPERATIONS UPON NERVES. means of an incision one inch and a lialf long, made parallel to the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and just to its outer side. After the integuments and fascia have been divided the nerve is brought at once into view, the artery lying to its radial side. THE MUSCULO-SPIKAL NERVE. Operation.—The nerve is most conveniently exposed at the point at which it gains the outer side of the arm. The elbow is flexed, and the arm carried a little across the patient’s thorax. An incision, from two * to two and a half inches in length, is made obliquely across the outer surface of the arm at its lower third. V The centre of the incision is made to correspond to a point midway between the insertion of the deltoid and the external condyle, and its obliquity is so determined that the lower part of the incision will follow the line of the upper border of the supinator longus. The skin and fascia having been divided, the surgeon with his forefinger seeks for the nerve as it lies close to the bone, piercing the intermuscular septum and about to cross the upper limit of the supinator muscle. If the fibres of this muscle be exposed, the position of the nerve can be more readily determined-. The supinator muscle may be drawn outwards so as to demonstrate the groove between it and the brachialis anticus. The nerve may be carefully separated from the companion artery and drawn forwards by means of a blunt hook. THE GREAT SCIATIC NERVE. Operation.—The nerve is most accessible for stretch- ing if exposed at the lower border of the glutens maximus muscle, just as it is leaving the hollow between the tuber ischii and the great trochanter. This corresponds to its most superficial part. The patient should be turned sufficiently over upon the lace to enable the buttock to be exposed and the thigh

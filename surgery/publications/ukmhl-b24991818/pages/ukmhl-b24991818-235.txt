219 EXCISION OF JOINTS. CHAP. V.] (a) The ])eriosteum being presei'ved, new l)one is formed to x’eplace that which has been removed. (b) The capsule- of the joint is preserved, and the con- nections of the ligaments ai’e not severed; the new arti- culation is therefore likely to be all the stronger. (c) The connections of the tendons with the periosteum are not disturbed, and greater muscular strength is con- sequently given to the new joint. (cl) There is much less hsemorrhage, the chief area of the operation being subperiosteal. (e) Planes of connective tissue are not opened up, and the cavity left after the removal of the bones is limited and circumscribed by the capsulo-periosteal sheath. With regard to these claims, there is no doubt but that, in favourable circumstances, a large quantity of new bone is produced to make good that lost by the operation. The importance of the periosteum in this connection woidd apjxear to be paramount, although some recent writers have adduced evidence in support of the view that . the bone-forming functions of the periosteum have been over-estimated. The preservation of ligaments and tendinous connections is another advantage of this method—an advantage that is substantial and definite. The disadvantages of the subperiosteal operation cannot, on the other hand, be overlooked. The measxire is admirable in theory, but it does not always assume so immaculate a position in practice. In the first place the operation is often impossible. The detachment of the periosteum is difiicult and tedious. The student who attempts a subperiosteal resection for the first time upon the cadaver will find, especially if the subject be old, that the periosteum is not so substantial a membrane as is sometimes represented, and that its separation is a matter of considerable mechanical difficulty. The operator who blindly persists in following this method will often find that, after much valuable time has

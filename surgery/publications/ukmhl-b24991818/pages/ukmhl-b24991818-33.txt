17 CHAP. II.] LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. nearest to the artery (on its inner side) at tlie uj)per part of the woiuicl. Comment.—The median basilic vein is closely attached to tlie thin integument, and, unless made quite evident, may easily be wounded. 2. Up^atiire at tine Itfiddle of tlic Arm. Operation.—The limb having been placed in the position indicated, an incision about two and a half inches in length is made along the inner edge of the biceps muscle, in the line of the artery (Fig. 8). The fascia, which is here thin, is exposed and divided, and the muscular layer is reached. It is extremely important that the inner margin of the biceps be clearly ex- posed and surely identified. The muscle is displaced a little out- wards, and the pulsation of the vessel is sought for. A little dis- section . exposes the median nerve —if it be not already in view (Fig. 7). In the middle of the arm the nerve usually lies in front of the artery. In applying a ligature to any part of the brachial, at or above the middle of its course, the nerve should be drawn out- wards. If the brachial be exposed below the middle section, the nerve is more conveniently displaced in- wards. While the artery is being exposed the elbow may be flexed for a moment.

The sheath of the artery having been opened, and the veme comites separated as well as possible, the needle is passed from the nerv'e. The inner of the two companion veins is usually much the larger.

177 AMPUTATIONS. CHAP. XV.] Ihemorrhage.—The popliteal artery and vein are the only vessels of any size requiring ligature. Ligatures will probabl)'- be needed for the sural arteries, the azygos artery, for branches of the superior articular vessels (especially on the outer side), and for the superficial division of the anastomotica inagna (on the other side of the limb). Comment.—This operation provides an excellent and complete covering for the condyles of the femur. When the edges of the flaps are brought together the wound looks directly downwards as the patient lies in bed. The stump, therefore, is admirably provided for in the matter of drain- age. AT THE KNEE-JOINT. (After Bryant.) The cicatrix lies in an antero- posterior direction between the con- dyles, and in process of time occupies the intercondyloid notch. Into this depression it sinks, and the prominent condyles serve to effectually protect it from pressure. It will be seen, moreover, that the scar is in time drawn towards the posterior aspect of the limb, and is thus further protected from pressure Avhen an artificial leg is worn (Fig. G1). 2. Disarticulation l>y T‘:iii|>- tical Incision {Bcmden's Operation).—The instruments required and the position of the patient and the surgeon are the same as in the previous operation. The interarticular line having been made out, the antero-posteiior diameter of the limb at this line is esti- mated. The elliptical incision is so planned that its lowest part crosses the crest of the tibia at a distance below the joint-line equal to the antero posterior diameter of the limb. The highest part of the ellipse reaches the median line pos- teriorly at a distance of half a diameter below the same line. The incision is inclined at an angle of 30 degrees (Fig. 62, a). The incision is carried through the integuments, which

120 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [paut iii. carry the incision clown, through the clavicular fibres of the deltoid and pectoralis major, till I reach the humeral attach- ment of the latter muscle, which I divide. “ I then, with a gentle curve, carry the incision across and fairly through the lower fibres of the deltoid towards the posterior boi’der of the axilla, unless the textures be much torn. (The incision so far is carried the whole length directly down to the bone.) - “ I next mark out the line of the lower part of the inner section by carrying an incision through the skin and fat only, from the point where my straight incision terminated {i.e. at the lower end of the insertion of the pectoralis major), across the inside of the arm, to meet the incision at the outer part (Fig. 39). This ensures accuracy in the line of union, but is not essential. “ (2) If the fibres of the deltoid have been thoroughly divided in the line of incision, the flap so marked out can be easily separated (by the point of a finger, without further use of the knife) from the bone and joint, together with the trunk of the pos- terior circumflex, which enters its deep surface, and be drawn upwards and backwards so as to expose the head and tuberosities. “ (3) The tendinous insertions of the capsular muscles, the long head of the biceps and the capsule, are next divided by cutting directly on the tuberosities and head of the bone (the humerus being rotated by the assistant as required). The broad subscapular tendon especially, being very fully exposed by the incision, can be much mox’e easily and completely divided than in the double-flap method. By keeping the large outer flap out of the way by a broad copper spatula or the finger of an assistant, and taking care to keep the edge of the- knife close to the bone, as in Fig. 39. — DISARTICU- L AT ION AT THE SHOULDER BY R.YCKET INCISION. {Spence’s operation.)

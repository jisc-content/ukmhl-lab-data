[part XIV. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 476 render these aseptic, and hence the wound .should not be made through this region of skin. (2) In many cases, probably in all, it is best to remove with the breast the costal or lower portion of the gi’eat pectoral muscle, and this is rendered easy by this modification of the old incision. (3) Clearing the axilla, especially the upper part of it between the clavicle and first rib, is done by open dissection Fig. 121.—INCISIONS FOR REMOVAL OF BREAST AND CONTENTS OF AXILLA, SHOWING MODIFICATIONS ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT OF SKIN REQUIRED TO BE REMOVED. In the left figure the shaded area (tlie upper and outer quadrant of the breast) indicates that part in which scirrhus commences in nearly three out of four cases. In Ijoth figures the wound is placed in front of the axilla, and its upper end curves over the i)ectoralis insertion. through this incision. By the mid-axillary one this step was efi'ected mainly by finger traction in the dark, with increased risk of venous hiemorrhage. Wheti adhesions exist between the skin and tumour, the former must be freely sacrificed, as a slight delay in healing of the wound is of no importance compared with the risk of leaving nests of cancer-cel Is behind. In some case.i it is advisable to excise a V-shaped piece of skin

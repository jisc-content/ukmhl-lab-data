S UBGICA L OPERA TIONS. [part III. 184 end of the divided femur. ' A dozen pressure forceps. Artery and dissecting forceps. Retractors, scissors, needles, etc. l*o»itioii.—The patient’s buttocks rest upon the end of tlie table. The sound leg is secured out of the way. Means should be taken to prevent the body from slipping off the table. The surgeon stands to tlie right of the limb in the case of either extremity. 1. The liiciilai- Aiiipiitatioii. — Owing to the unequal manner in which the divided muscles retract, the simple circular operation is not adapted for the thigh. In order to allow for this irregular retraction, the incision must be placed obliquely. This operation should only be carried out in the lower third of the limb. Farabeuf gives the following directions for the incision :— • On the anterior and outer aspects of the limb the distance between the level of the proposed saw-cut and the incision on the skin should be equal to one-fourth of the circumference of the thigh at the former point. On the hinder and inner aspects of the limb the skin-incision should be made a little less than half this length lower down. In other respects the details of the operation resemble those of the circular method elsewhere. 2. Syiiic’s Modification of the Circular Am- putation.—By this method the circular operation is simjdified. The skin is much moi’e easily dissected up, and the integuments are less roughly handled in the process of separation. The operation consists practically of the usual circular incision, with two lateral cuts to aid the retraction of the skin. Two very short antero-posterior flaps of semilunar out- line and of equal width and length are dissected up. They are composed simply of the integument and subcutaneous tissues, and consist of little more than curved incisions made across the front and" the back of the thigh, each being equal to one-half of the circumfei’ence of the limb.

83 CHAPTER IT. Amputation of the Finger.s and Thumb. . Oeiieral Considerations.—The position of the pliahingeal joints mnst be clearly defined. In performing these operations every care should be taken to remove as little of the digit, and especially of the thumb and index, as possible. The shortest and most ungainly-looking stump of the thumb or of the forefinger may prove to be of the gi’eatesfc value. If the thumb or a portion of it be left, it is important that it should have something with which to come into apposition ; and in fulfilling this need the slightest stum]-) of the forefinger is of consicleriible service. Tlie little and ring fingers ai’e of less importance, provided that tlie other digits I’emain; but in cases where the three or the two outer fingers have been removed, the little finger or the ring finger has been capable, in conjunction with the thumb, of performing most valuable and most complex functions. A hand with nothing left but the stumps of a thumb and of a little finger is more useful than the most elaborate artificial limb. The bone should always be divided as low down as ])0ssible. If only the base of the terminal phalanx can be saved, it will secure for the finger the attachment of .the fiexor profundus tendon. Amputation of the second phalanx should be performed through the bone whenever possible. If the upper half, or even the upper third, of the phalanx be left, .some portion of the insertion of the flexor sublimis will be saved. It is sometimes said that a stump formed of the whole or part of the first phalanx alone will be immobile and use- less. With regard to the index and little fingers this is

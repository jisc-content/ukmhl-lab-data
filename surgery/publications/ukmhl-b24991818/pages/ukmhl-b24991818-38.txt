9--) CHAPTER III. Ligature of the Arteries of the Head and Neck. THE SURCLAVIAN ARTERY. A ligature ha.s been applied to each of the three parts of the subclavian artery. So far as surgical experience at present extends, it may be said that the operation is rai’ely justifiable, except in the third part of the artery. l-.igafiire ol'tlic Third Part of fln‘ Siibolaviaii Artery. Position.—The patient lies upon the back, close to the edge of the table, with the thorax raised and the head extended and tui-ned to the opposite side. * The arm should be pulled well down and fixed. This latter object is best effected by passing the arm behind the back, whenever that is possible, and allowing it to remain fixed in that posture. The operator stands in front of the .shoulder. A good light is necessary. Operation.—The skin over the posterior triangle having been drawn down witli the fingers of the left hand, an in- cision is made through it down to the clavicle. By adopting this plan a risk of wounding the extei’ual jugular vein is avoided. The incision, which is transverse, should be about three inches in length, and when the traction upon the skin is withdrawn should lie about half, an inch above the clavicle (Fig. 10). It should extend acro.ss the base of the posterior triangle from the trapezius to the sterno- mastoid, and should be so planned that the centre of the wound shall correspond to a point about one inch to the inner side of the centre of the clavicle. This first incision divides the integuments, the platysma, and the supra- clavicular nerves, with possibly a vein which passes over the clavicle to connect the cephalic vein with the external

•58 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [paht i. 2. l.iK^aliiro ill llic ITIiiliilc Tliird of llio Operation.—Tho position is tlie same.as in the above operation. Make an incision tliree indies in length along the line of the artery (Fig. 15). Tlie deep fascia is.exposed. The interval between the tibialis anticus and extensor communis is indicated by a yellowish white line. This is due, not to a distinct septum, but to a line of fatty tissue lodged betAveen the two muscles. In emaciated subjects the line may not be apparent. The deep fascia is divided along this line. The two muscles above named are found lying close together. The outer edge of the tibialis anticus is .still muscular, but the inner edge of the common extensor is now tendinous. Flex the foot. Separate the muscles with the handle of the scalpel, keeping in the direc- tion of the tibia. The artery is found upon the interosseous membrane, Avith the still deeply placed extensor pollicis to its outer side. The nerve Avill be exposed before the artery is reached, since it here usually lies in front of the vessel. The needle may be passed from either side. It may be impos- sible to separate the vena3 com- ites, but great care must be taken to avoid the nerve. In the living subject persistent attempts to separate the veme comites Avill probably only lead to laceration of those ve.ssels. It is better to tie veins and artery tosether.

[PAET III. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 194 siDot—the middle of the thigh, or below, or even near the knee.” {b) Esmarclts.—This method is identical with that described by Veitch, Lacauchie, Volkmann, and others. Mr. Barker gives the following account of Esmarch’s operation ;— “ By a single, strong, muscular sweep of the knife five inches below the tip of the trochanter, all the soft parts of the thigh are divided completely to the bone, and the latter is at once sawn across. “ The vessels are then ligatured. “ The bone is now seized in a lion forceps and steadied, while a second incision is made, commencing two inches above the tip of the trochanter, and carried down along the latter, to terminate in the first circular cut. The two borders of this incision being held apart by an assistant, the bone is cleared of the soft parts by the use of an elevator inserted under the periosteum, and by the knife where the muscle-insertions are too firm for the latter. When the capsule is reached it is divided, and the head is' dislocated in the usual way.” 2. Di<!>ai'ticiilatiou tlirou^li an Anterior Racket Incision.—This method is also known as the anterior oval method. The same instruments are required as are used in the previous operation. In addition to those mentioned, an aneurysm needle and a small scalpel will be needed. Re- tractors are occasionally employed. The jmsition of the surgeon and of his assistants is the same. The patient is so placed that the pelvis rests upon the extreme end of the table and the trunk evenly upon the back. I'he Operation.—(1) No tourniquet is applied. The in- cision is commenced at the centre of Poupart’s ligament, and is carried downward along the course of the femoral vessels for about three inches. It is then made to curve inwards so as to cross the adductors about four inches below the genito-crural fold. The knife then sweeps over the posterior aspect of the thigh crosses the outer side of the

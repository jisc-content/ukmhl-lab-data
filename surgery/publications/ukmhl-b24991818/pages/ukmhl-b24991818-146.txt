CHAPTER X. Amputation of the Toes. In dealing with the anterior part of the foot it must be remembered that the foot rests upon the heel, the heads of the metatarsal bones, and the inner margin of the sole. In amputation, therefore, every cai'e should be taken to save as much as possible of the metatarsus, and especially of the first metatarsal bone and the phalanges of the great toe. The same care need not be taken to preserve every possible part of the four outer toes. A sloughing stump has often resulted from too great anxiety to preserve these almost useless digits. In^ti’u 111 cuts.—Stout, narrow scalpels, with blades from one inch to two inches in length, and with well- rounded points. A fine keyhole-saw, or minute Butcher’s saw. Bone forceps. Dissecting and artery forceps. Tapes, or strips of aseptic gauze, to retract the toes. Scissors, needles, etc. Position.—In all these operations upon the toes the patient should lie on the back, and the foot be brought well beyond the end of the couch. The surgeon should sit at the end of the table facing the patient. The assistants stand—facing the surgeon—one on each side of the end of the table. One should fix the limb and hold the toe, while the other attends to the wound. The operations included in this chapter will be dealt with in the following order ;— A. Amputation of the distal phalanges. B. Disarticulation at the metatarso-phalangeal joints. C. Amputation of the toes en masse through the meta- tarsus.

SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part in. crossing his right leg over tlie left one he throws the weight of his body on to his doubled-up right hand, which is made to compress the aorta at the level of the umbilicus. The pressure, which can be maintained during a long operation without undue fatigue, need only be sufficient to stop the femoral pulsation, tested by the assistant’s left hand. Several other methods to prevent bleeding have been used from time to time. The following modes of performing this amputation will be described :—- 1. Disarticulation through an external racket incision. 2. Disarticulation through an anterior racket incision. 3. Disarticulation by - antero-posterior flaps (trans- fixion). 1. Disarticulation tiiroiig:li an Dxtci-nal ICackct Incision. Instruments.—A stout amputating knife with a blade some six inches in length, and with not too tine a point; a large stout scalpel or resection knife ; an amputating-saw ; lion forceps if the bone is to be divided; artery forceps; pressure forceps; dissecting forceps; scissors, long needles, etc. Position.—The body is drawn down until the pelvis rests upon the extreme lower edge of the table. The sound limb is secured out of the way. The patient is turned sufficiently over on the sound side to expose the jiostero-external aspect of the limb to be removed. Some care has to be taken to prevent the patient from slipping entirely off’ the table. The surgeon stands at the outer side of the thigh—in the case of both the right and the left extremities—and faces the patient. In the case of the left limb it may be sometimes more convenient to stand on the inner side of the thigh between the limbs. The assistant standing above the surgeon attends to the

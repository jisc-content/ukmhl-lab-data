19G SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part ur. divided. Retracfcors are of use at this stage of the operation. (5) The muscles in the inner Hap are now cut at the level of the retracted skin. These include the pectineus, the gracilis, and the superficial adductoi-s. Any divided vessels are secured. (6) Adduct the thigh, and rotate it inwards so as to expose the great trochanter. Divide the insertions of the muscles attached to this' process, notably the gluteus minimus and inedius. (7) Abduct the limb and rotate it out. Incise the capsule transversely. Disarticulate. Divide the round ligament and also the obturator externus tendon, if it has up to the pi'esent escaped division. (8) The limb being still more rotated outwards, the head of the femur is dragged forward, and the longer knife being passed behind the bone, all the soft parts at the posterior aspect of the limb are divided with one sweep of the blade at the level of the retracted skin. These tissues will include the hamstrings, the great sciatic nerve, and the undivided parts of the adductoi's, principally represented by the adductor magnus. When the wound is approximated, there should be no strain upon the sutures, which are deeply applied. Hcemorrhage.—It is a feature of this operation that the vessels ai'e ligatured as they are exposed, the surgeon deal- ing with the hiemorrhage according to the method adopted during this removal of a large tumour. In my experience of this operation the loss of blood has been quite insignificant 3. Difiiarliculatioii by Aiiloi'o-Poslcrior Flaps (Ti’jnisfixioii).—The great feature of the operation con- sists in the rapidity with which it can be performed. Fer- gusson states that the procedure can be completed (so far as the u.se of the knife is concerned) in from twelve to twenty seconds. This was a matter of no little moment before the days of ether and chloroform. The anterior flap is long and U-shaped. The posterior flap is shorter, and is more squai'ely cut.

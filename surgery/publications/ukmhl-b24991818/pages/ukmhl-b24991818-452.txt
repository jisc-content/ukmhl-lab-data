SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part X. 43G deprecated. When substantial and i)oweiâ€™ful muscles are met with, it may sometimes be advisable to divide the fibres transversely, to a slight extent, close to their attachment to the bone. Any bleeding points are secured with pressure forceps. The transversalis fascia is reached, and is divided in the same precise manner in the median line. Tlie area of connective tissue overlying the summit of the bladder is now exposed. This must be cleanly and precisely divided with the scalpel, and tlie bladder reached by dissection. The peritoneum may possibly be made out and can be readily pushed upwards with the left forefinger. The dis- section necessary to expose the bladder should be com- menced close to the symphysis, and be continued cautiously u})wards. The bladder is recognised by its pinkish colour, by its rounded outline, and by the exposed layer of muscular fibres. The peritoneum, if in view, must be pushed upwards with the left forefinger, while the surgeon transfixes the bladder with a sharp hook. This hook should be introduced transversely across the median line, and should be inserted near the upper part of the exposed viscus. The scalpel is now thrust vertically into the bladder, exactly in the median line and just below the hook, and is made to incise the organ by cutting downwards towards the symphysis. It should be introduced with a sharp stab, lest the undivided mucous membrane be pushed inwards by its point. The actual opening of the bladder is demonstrated by the escape of the contained fluid. The hold upon the tenaculum should not be relaxed. The cut margin of the bladder on either side of the opening should now be seized neatly and symmetrically with pressure forceps. These enable the operator to maintain a hold upon the organ dui-ing the remainder of the operation, and they render the position of the opening perfectly distinct. When the forceps are in place, but not before, the tenaculum may be removed.

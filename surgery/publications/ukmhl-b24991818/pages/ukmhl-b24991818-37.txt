21 CHAP. II.] LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. fossa. It passes about half an inch below the clavicle, and the centre of the incision is about opposite to the centre of that bone (Fig. 10). The skin, platysma, supraclavicular Jierves, and fascia are divided in the first incision. At the outer end of the wound care must be taken not to injure the cephalic vein and the lar^e branch of the acromio thoracic arterv. O The cephalic vein should be exposed, and forms a useful guide to the artery. The outer edge of the pectoralis major is divided through its entire thickness close to the clavicle, and to the full extent of the original wound. The upper edge of the lesser pectoral should be defined, and may be di’awn down if necessary. The costo-coracoid membrane must now be dealt with. It must not be torn through, but should be divided vertically near to the coracoid process. The cephalic vein, if well brought out, will indicate the position of the axillary vein. The latter vessel is readily torn in freeing a way thi'ough the costo-coracoid membranie. The internal anterior thoracic nerve, coming forwards between the axillary vein and artery, may, if seen, prove a guide to the latter vessel, the pulsation of which should, of course, be felt for. The artery is now exposed, and the needle should be passed from the vein. _ The vein should be held aside with the finger while the needle is being passed. It must be remembered that the vein is least in the way when the arm is by the side. Comment.—There is a great danger of tearing the axillary vein, and also of air being drawn into some of the smaller veins. If the pectoralis minor receive a slip from the second rib, the area of the operation is much curtailed. The cord or the brachial plexus neare.st to the arteiy may be mistaken for that ves.sel.

Iiisti’uiiieiits rcQiiircd.—Trephines of vai-ious sizes ; a quill; a pair of Key’s saws ; a small pair of bone-cutting forceps; slender chisel and mallet; a gouge; a ])air of gouge forceps, such as Hopkins’s rongeur, or Hofmann’s modified form; an elevator; periosteal rugine ; necrosis forceps; scalpels; dissecting and Wells’s forceps; .scissors; dressing forceps; fine-toothed forceps, and fine scissors for the dura mater; small tenaculum or slender curved needle in a handle for bleeding vessels ; j^robe; needles and sutures. Proparatioii of tlic Patient.—The head is shaved, then washed with soap and water, and scrubbed with a nail-brush. It is next washed with ether, and finally with a 1 in 20 solution of carbolic acid in alcohol, or the 1 in 500 alcoholic solution of biniodide of mercury. The head is conveniently supported upon a sand-bag covered with macintosh sheeting and sterilised towels. Tlic Opei'atioii.—When any wound already exists, the fracture is exjiosed by enlarging it as required. When the scalp is sound, a semilunar flap may be raised, the free end of which points vertically downwards. It should form a shallow curve, and be so planned as to avoid the main scalp arteries.

80 [PAET III. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. I’incision eu raquette, tlie longitudinal wound forming the handle of the ‘‘ racket.” This incision is also called by the French Vincision en croupih'e, and in some amputations it certainly moi’e closely conforms to the outline of a crupper than to that of a racket. The racket, crupper, and T-shaped incisions are best illustrated by disarticulations at the metacarpo-phalangeal and metatarso-phalangeal lines of joints. Amputation by the racket incision is also illustrated by certain disarticulations at the shoulder and at the hip joints. 5. Tlic Flap Mefliotl.—Any flap or flaps may be composed of the integuments only, or of the integuments and the subjacent muscular tissue. In every flap the skin must be cut longer than the muscle tissue. A flap containing too much muscular tissue is unwieldy; it is difficult to adjust, and the muscle is certain to protrude. In endeavouring to bring the edges of the skin together, undue strain is apt to be placed upon the sutures. A flap composed of skin only is very apt to slough. This tendency; is least obsei’ved in the integuments about joints, where the vascular supply of the skin is derived from many channels ; elsewhere an extensive skin flap is very liable to perish for lack of blood. In general terms, therefore, it may be said that the best flaps are those which contain muscular tissue, provided always that the skin covering the stumps be longer than the divided muscles which it contains. Modes of Cutting Flaps.—The methods of fashioning flaps have been already in general terms alluded to. Considered more in detail, and from the point of view of the manipulation of the knife, three methods of cutting flaps may be specified :— (a) By transfixion. (b) By cutting from without inwards. (c) By dissection. (a) In cutting by transfixion, a long knife, equal in length

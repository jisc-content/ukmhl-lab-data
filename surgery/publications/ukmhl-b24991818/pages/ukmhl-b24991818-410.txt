If the renal wound be not sutured, then a full-sized drainage-tube should be introduced to the very bottom of the incision. It should be in contact with the wound in the kidney; around it should be packed some gauze, which will act as an addi- tional drain. The wound in the parietes is then closed in the usual way, and the drainage-tube secured in place by a suture. II.—Hephrectomy. The operation of removing or excising the kidney has been performed for tumour of the kidney, for renal or ureteral fistula, and for disorganisation of the organ by injm-y, tuberculous disease, suppuration, or urinary infiltration. Nephrectomy may be performed in two ways :— 1. By incision through the loin—lumbar nephrec- tomy. ^ 2. By incision thi’ough the anterior abdominal parietes—abdominal nephrectomy. 1.

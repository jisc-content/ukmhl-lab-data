176 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part III. The flaps ai’e retracted to the level of the joint-line. (3) An incision is now made along the extreme upper margin of the tibia. This incision, which is transverse and concerns the anterior and lateral aspects of the bone, divides everything down to the bone, including the ilio- tibial band, the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, semitendin- osus, and biceps muscles, the internal and external lateral ligaments, and, lastly, the co- ronary ligaments attachins: the semilunar cartilages. The knife, indeed, entei'S the joint between the upper surface of the tibia and these cartilages, and it is in this manner the articulation is opened. In dividing the coronary ligaments the knife should be entered at the sides of the joint and not in front. The knee is now flexed, and the two crucial ligaments are carefully divided from before backwards. (4) Nothing remains but to divide by a vigorous transverse cut the soft parts still connect- ing the leg with the thigh, viz. the posterior ligament of the joint, the popliteal vessels nerves, the popliteus and trocnemius muscles, and semimembranosus or other undivided tendon of the ham. Before making this final incision, the assistant who Fig. 00.—A, Stephen Smith’s disarticulation at the knee ; B, Amputation of the thigh by lateral flaps. and gas- the IS retracting the flaps should compress the popliteal artery against the lower end of the femur.

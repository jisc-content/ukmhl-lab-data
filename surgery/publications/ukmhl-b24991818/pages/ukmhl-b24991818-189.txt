CHAP. XIV.] AMPUTATIONS. 173 the free end of the external Hap. The posterior tibial and peroneal vessels are cut close together, and lie on the same plane upon the face of the inner flap. (Fig. 58.) Several muscular branches will require ligature notably the sural arteides connected with the gastrocnemius muscle, and the large branch from the posterior tibial artery to the soleus. The nutrient artery of the tibia will be divided at or about its entrance into the bone. Comment.—An excellent stumjD results from this operation. The cicatrix comes upon its inner side and is well removed from pressure. The bones are admirably covered, and, if the operation be carefully carried out, the vitality of the great flap is ensured. 2. Aiiipiitatioii by Equal Eatcral Haps.—The generalshape and position of the flapg areshown in Fig. 59, A. The flaps are semilunar in outline. The anterior median incision is commenced some 2 cm. below the future saw- line, and is carried vertically downwards just to the outer side of the crest or anterior border of the tibia. The posterior incision is commenced on the back of the leg, at a point diametrically opposite to the commencement of the anterior incision. In length each flap should slightly exceed the half- diameter of the limb at the saw-line, retraction being allowed for. The flaps are dissected up as skin-flaps. A little way below the saw-line the soft parts of the limb are divided transversely down to the bones. They are then sepai-ated from the bones, and the operation is completed as in amputation by the circular method. The bones are divided as shown in Fig. 56. This operation is merely a modiflcation of the circular amputation. It is easier to perform. The cicatrix is terminal, and is antero-posterior instead of being transvei’se.

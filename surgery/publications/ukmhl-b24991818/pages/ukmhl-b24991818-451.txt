Iiisti-iiiiieiits required.—A scalpel; probe-pointed bistoury; scissors; sharp hook, blunt hooks ; dissecting, artery, and pressure forceps; broad rectangular retractors; wound retractors ; sound ; lithotomy forceps and scooj:); drainage tube for bladder ; needles, sutures, ligatures, etc. l>i<!)leii§ioii of iSie Bladder.—A soft catheter is passed, the urine is drawn off, and through the catheter the bladder is washed out with a warm boracic solution (half an ounce to the pint). This is more conveniently done with an irrigator than with a syringe. The bladder is now filled with a weak warm solution of boracic acid. In chil- dren from two to five years of age, three to six ounces will probably suffice. In adults, eight to ten or twelve ounces may be introduced. The injection should be carried out by means of an irrigator held a few feet above the level (jf the table. The irrigator is detached, and a Wells’s forceps or clip applied to the catheter prevents the fluid from escaping. of tlic Bladder. — An incision about three inches in length is made precisely in the median line immediately above the symphysis. The incision should be extended about half an inch actually over that 2>rocess of Ijone. There is no linea alba below the umbilicu.s, and after dividing the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the surgeon may find muscular fibre lying across the line of the incision. If the interval between the muiscles is not readily found, the knife should be carried directly tlu-ough the muscle fibres themselves, the median line being strictly observed. The wound must be a clean one, and any tearing of the parts with the fingers or forceps, or the handle of the scalpel, to .seek for an intermuscular interval, is to be

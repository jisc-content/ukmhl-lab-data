SUROIGAL OPERATIONS. [part I. 20 Conuaent.—The numerous nerves in relation with this part of the vessel somewhat confuse the operation. Tlie veins are apt to obscure the vessel. There may be three veins in relation with this part of the axillary—the two veme comites and the still ^ree basilic. Abnormalities in the artery must be anticipated. A muscular slip, pass- ing from tlie latissimus dorsi to join the pectoralis major, biceps, or coraco-brachialis, may cross over the vessels. Such a slip may readily be mistaken, when large, for the coraco-brachialis muscle. The ligature should not be applied too near any one of the branches of the artery. 2. of flic Firsf Part. Operation. — The patient lies upon the back, close to the margin of the table, with the upper part of the body raised. The point of the shoulder should be carried well back, and to effect this a hard cushion may be placed between the .scapulse. The aim is allowed to lie by the patient’s side. It must not be dragged upon so as to depress the point of the shoulder. The ojjerator should stand u])on the outer side of the limb, near the patient’s trunk, when dealing with the left side, and near the head when dealing with the right. A good reflected light is ne- cessary. A slightly curved incision, three inches long, with the convexity downwards, is made across the infraclavicular Fig. !).—UG.VTURE OP THE lUUHT AXILLARY ARTERY (THIRD part).

[part I. S U TIG IGA L OPERA TIONS. 4G THE FEMORAL ARTERY. Line of the Artery.—The hip being a little flexed and the thigh abducted and rotated outwards, a line is drawn from a point midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, to the tuber- osity of the internal condyle. The centi-e of Pouj>art’s ligament is entirely to the outer side of the line of the vessels. ' The superficial femoral may be ligatured in Hunter’s canal or at the apex of Scarpa’s triangle. The common femoral may be ligatured at the base of that triangle. The only one of these three operations which is per- formed with any degree of frequency is the ligature at the apex of Scarpa’s triangle. This is called the “ place of election,” and in any case in which “ ligature of the femoral ” is advised or is mentioned, it is assumed that the vessel is secured at this point. Position.—The patient lies upon the back, with the hip a little flexed, the thigh abducted and rotated outwards, the knee bent and the leg resting upon its external surface. The surgeon stands to the outer side of the limb in either case, and the chief assistant is placed opposite to him. The incision—in the case of the right thigh—is made from above downwards, and in the case of the left from below upwards. 1. Lig^iitiii’c of tlic Foiiioral in lliiiitcr’s fhinal. Operation.—The limb having been placed as already indicated, an incision about three inches in length is made along the line of the artery in the middle third of the thigh. In the layer of subcutaneous tissue the anterior division'of the internal cutaneous nerve will probably be met with, and to the inner side of it the long saphenous vein. This vessel must be drawn inwards. I’he fascia lata is now divided in the line of the original wound, and the sartorius is exposed. This muscle must

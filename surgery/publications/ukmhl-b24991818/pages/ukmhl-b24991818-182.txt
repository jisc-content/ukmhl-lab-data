In finishing , O it, the bend of the U, the ter- minal part of the flap, is com- pleted (Fig. 53, b). On the left leg the limb may be first turned upon its inner side {i.e. with that surface looking downwards), and the operation commenced by cutting the outer vertical in- cision. The incisions thus made concern the skin only, and the integuments are well freed along all parts of the cut. (2) The leg is now flexed upon the thigh, and the knee turned outwards so as to expose the calf. When in this position, and while the foot is flexed, the gastrocnemius muscle is picked up between the fingers and thumb and is divided transversely at the level of the retracted skin. (3) Two short, deep, vertical incisions are now made from above downwards through the soft parts at either margin of the flap. These incisions extend to the bone: the inner direct to the tibia, the outer to the fibula behind the peronei muscles. In the gaps thus made the thumb and fingers of the left hand are inserted, and the muscles of the calf, being firmly grasped, are lifted up from the bones. The muscles are now care- fully separated from the bones

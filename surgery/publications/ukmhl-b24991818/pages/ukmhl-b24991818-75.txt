Such coils of bowel as present themselves are kept away from the operation area by sponges and retractors. Tlie j)eritoneuui over the artery is divided by a vertical incision and the vessel well exposed. The needle is best passed from the vein—i.e. from right to left in dealing with the left common iliac, and from left to right in dealing with the opposite artery. INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 1- Tlic Extrapcriloneal Opcraf ion.—The in- ci.sion employed is the same as that made to secure the common iliac artery. The preparation of the patient, the position assumed, and the general features and special dangers of the opeia- tions for securing the iliac arteries, have already been dealt with in the sections on the external iliac and the common iliac. In the present case the peritoneum is pushed aside until the external iliacls reached. The surgeon is guided to the internal artery by following the more superficial trunk. The upper margin of the great sacro-sciatic notch is easily identified, and will serve to indicate the lower end of the artery. The passing of the ligature is difficult, and many aneurysm needles, of various sizes and with various curves, should be at hand. The needle should be passed, on either side of the body, from within out. 2. The Iiiti'iiporitoneal Operation.—This opera- tion represents the best method of reaching the internal iliac artery, and will no doubt rejilace the older method just described. The patient having been’jilaced on the table in the Trendelenburg position, the abdomen is opened in the middle line by an incision extending from the symphysis pubis to the umbilicus, or to a point a little above it. The intestines having been pushed up and drawn aside, the area of the deep wound is surrounded by sponges, and so cut off from the ])eritoneal cavity. The peritoneum over the artery is thus well exj)Osed,

AMPUTATIONS. 141 CHAP, XI.] sit at the end of the table facing the patient to cut the sole flap and complete the disarticulation. The assistants stand one on each side of the end of the table. Opci'atioii. {Right Foot.)—1. The Dorsal Fla}).—Grasp the extended foot with the left hand, so that the thumb is on the base of the fifth metatarsal bone and the forefinger on that of the first, while the palm of the hand faces the sole. The skin on the dorsum is stretched, and the knife is held in the free hand, with the forefinger on the back of the blade. In this position the dorsal flap is cut. The incision com- mences at the outer margin of the foot, just behind the tubercle of the fifth metatarsal bone (Fig. 44). For about an inch it follows the outer border of the bone. It then sweeps across the dorsum parallel to the line of the tarso-metatarsal joints and about half an inch in front of it. The cut is curved towards the toes, and reaches the plantar aspect of the inner border of the foot about half an inch in front of the tarsal joint of the great toe. It finally follows the inner margin of the foot, and ends three-fourths of an inch behind the said joint. The assistant now holds the foot fixed in the extended position while the surgeon uses his left fingers to dissect back the dorsal flap. The dissection at first includes the skin only; but when the integument has been retracted about one-fourth of an inch, the extensor tendons are divided. The flap contains therefore all the soft parts down to the bones. It is important to well expose the meta- tarsus, and to carry the flap back far enough to expose the Fig. 44.—LISFR,\NC’S AMPU- TATION.

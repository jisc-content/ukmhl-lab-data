Comment.—Scai’pa’s triangle is much smaller than would appear to be the case when the dissected region is in- spected. There may be no more than two inches of the artery left uncovered by the sartorius muscle. An unusually broad sarto- rius adds a little to the difficulty of the opera- tion. In order fo reach the edge of the sarto- rius muscle easily, the cut is often made too much to the inner side, with the I’esult that the great saphenous vein is cut into.

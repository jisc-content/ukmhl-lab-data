OSTEOTOMY. 203 CHAP. I.] of fixing or embedding the limb during the process of dividing the bone with the osteotome. A block of metal such as a leaden weight with rect- angular sides will be found very useful instead of the sand- bag. It should be encased in a sterilised towel, and when placed transversely it forms a good fulcrum on which to complete the fracture of the bone after it has been nearly chiselled through. THE OPERATION. Linear Osteotomy witli the Osteotome. —The limb having been firmly embedded in a sand pillow in a suitable position, a simple incision is made down to the bone This cut should be of sufficient size to admit the- largest osteotome intended to be used. It should be so placed as to avoid structures of importance, should be through the least vascular part of the limb, and should reach the bone by the most direct route. Before the knife is withdrawn the osteotome may be introduced by its side, the knife acting as a guide. Some surgeons make the skin wound correspond in direction and position with the intended wound in the bone ; others place the surface incision at right angles to the future bone cut, and turn the osteotome, after that instru- ment has been introduced. The former method is the better. The osteotome is driven through the bone with the mallet, cutting in various directions, until the bone is divided. The edge should be directed from any neighbour- ing great vessels. As the cut in the bone becomes deepei’, finer osteotomes may be used. The osteotome should be grasped firmly in the left hand, steadied by the inner border resting on the patient’s limb. The surgeon ought to cut to, instead of from, him- self ; thus, if the surgeon is operating on the inner side of the left limb, he ought to stand on the left side of the patient, and cut towards himself. This operation should never be attempted until the surgeon has gained quite an extensive experience by operti- ting upon animals’ bones, which should be quite fresh, and

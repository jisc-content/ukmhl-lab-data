PART V.] and "not close to that bone, and it should be done by the open method, for by this procedure alone is it possible to divide the muscle and fascia completely without risk of injury to the veins. Operation.â€”A general anaesthetic is given, the lioad and slioulders are well raised, the surgeon stands on the same side as that of the contracted muscle. By means of two incisions, one over the anterior edge of the muscle, the other parallel to and a little above the clavicle, the latter running across both heads of the muscle, a small triangular Hap of skin and superficial fascia is turned outwards. The assistant, who steadies the patientâ€™s head, makes the con- tracted muscle as tense as possible whilst the surgeon steadily divides first the sternal and then the clavicular portions and the fascial band. The division is done gradually fiâ€™om before backwards with a blunt-pointed tenotome or fine scalpel, and the large veins are looked for and care- fully avoided. The posterior part of the .sheath will usually be found to require division or stretching. By this deliberate and open division the risk of recurrence of the deformity is to a great extent avoided, and the necessity for wearing irksome apparatus largely disjjensed with. The small Hap of skin is fixed in place with a few fine silk- w'orm-gut sutures, and dressed with gauze and collodion or some otlier lighk and dry dressing. If I r'I "'i ' 11 irhii > iH iiiiiii

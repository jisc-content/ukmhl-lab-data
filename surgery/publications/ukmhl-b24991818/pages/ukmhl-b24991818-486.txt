470 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [l^VRT xiir. The instrument is directed forwards and iuwai’ds pai’allel with the long axis of the meatus. It is convenient to intro- duce a sliort piece of pencil or of gum-elastic catheter into the meatus as a guide, and to keep the gouge exactly parallel with it. If the instrument be directed inwards at ri"ht ansrles o o to the .surface of the skull at the point indicated, the antrum will certainly be missed, and the lateral sinus almost as certainly opened. The direction followed by the gouge is therefore of the utmost importance. In the adult the antrum will be reached at a depth not exceeding thi’ee-fifths of an inch. The loss of resistance and the escape of pus indicate when the cavity is opened. The opening is enlarged to the desired extent by means of the sharp gouge. If any necrosis be present, the gouge will need to be liberally employed. The tunnel in the bone having been well syringed out, a suitable drainage-tube is inserted, and the parts are well dusted with iodoform. Boracic fomentations form the most suitable dressing. Gentle syringing with weak antiseptic lotions should be employed daily, followed by gauze dressings. When all purulent discharge has ceased, the opening may be allowed to close. THK COMPLETE OK RADICAL MASTOID OPERATION. In certain cases of long-persisting otorrhoca with marked loss of hearing, an operation is performed which involves removal of the remains of the membrana tympani, the small bones of the ear, and the posterior wall of the meatus, so as to convert the tympanum and the mastoid antrum into one cavity. This is lined either by flaps from the soft tissues of the meatus or by epithelial grafts (Fig. 119). MR. BALLANCE’S method. “ The First Operation.—The incision is made behind the ])inna, and the latter held forward with a rake retractor. A round cross-cut burr, driven by an electric motor, is used

62 Part II. OPERATIONS UPON NERVES. CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY. The following are the operations Avhich ai’e considered in this section :— 1. Nerve stretching. 2. Neurotomy, or section of a nerve trunk. 3. Neurectomy, or excision of a portion of a nerve trunk. 4. Neurorraphy, or suture of a divided nerve trunk. 1. Nerve Stretehiiig'. — This procedure has been applied to nerves of all kinds, both large and small; to motor and sensory nerves, as Avell as to those of mixed composition. Nerve trunks ai'e more extensile near the spinal coi'd than at a distance, and in the upper than in the loAver limb. This depends probably upon the sti’ength of the nerve sheath, which is subject to A’ariation, and against which the main strain of the sti’etching is directed. The nerve is exposed at its most convenient and usually at its most superficial part, and is then clearly isolated and brought Avell into view. In the limbs the joints may be so flexed as to relax the ]iarts about the site of the operation. Good retractors will usually be required. The larger nerve trunks are stretched by means of the finger and thumb, smaller nerves by means of a suitable blunt hook, and the smallest cords with the aid of a fine probe. The nerve having been replaced, the incision is closed.

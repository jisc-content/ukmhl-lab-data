388 CHAPTER XII. Operations on the.Kidney. The following operations will be described :— 1. Nepbroditbotomy, or incision of the kidney or its pelvis for stone. 2. Xephrectomy, or removal of the kidney. 3. Nephrorraphy, or fixation of a movable kidney. 4. Uretero-lithotomy. I.—X ephro-lithotoji Y. The value of the Rontgen rays as an aid to diagnosis is considerable. Unless the patient be very stout, this method will very usually indicate the presence of a stone, its size and position, and wliether there is more than one. This exposure to the rays need not be a long one in order to obtain satisfactoiy results; indeed, one of ten' to fifteen seconds will give a better radiograph than a more prolonged one, as the blurring of shadow due to respiratory movement can be easily avoided with the short exposure. A well-marked shadow of a renal calculus will enable the operator to mark its exact position, measuring from the iliac crest and spines. The X-ray photographs are, however, not an infallible test for renal calculi. Very small stones may not be detected by them, nor larger ones in stout patients ; and an abscess in the kidney may occasionally simulate calculus by causing a defined shadow, Tumours in or about the kidney may cause a faint shadow hardly to be compared with that caused by a stone. Iu$truinont<si required.—Scalpels; bistouries; dis- secting, artery, and jiressure forceps ; two rectangular metal retractors. The following special instruments are used in

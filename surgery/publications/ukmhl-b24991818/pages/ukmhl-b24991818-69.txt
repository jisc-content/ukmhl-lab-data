CHAP. V.] LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. 53 The lower fibres of the internal oblicjue muscle are drawn upwards (Fig- 24), and are divided close to their attachment to Poupart’s ligament. The extent of the di\’i- sion corresponds to tlie extent of muscle tissue exposed in the wound. (The internal oblique is attached to the outer half or two-tliii’ds of Poupart’s ligament, the transvei’salis to the outer third only.) The fascia transversalis is now exposed, and is divideil Fig. 24. —LIGATURE OF RIGHT F-XTF.RNAL ILIAC ARTERY. {Cooper's Method, modified.)

At this stage of the operation care must be taken not to wound the deep epigastric artery, which passes—between ' the transA'ersalis fascia and the peritoneum—across the wound area. The external iliac artery can now be made out. Tlie subperitoneal tissue about the vessels should be gently loosened, and the pi'ritoneum then witli the utmost care be

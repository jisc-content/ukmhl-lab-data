CHAP, n.] RADICAL CURE OF HERNIA. 421 3. The sac is lield by pressure forceps and twisted on its long axis several times. The left index finger is passed upwards along the canal under the oblique and transversalis muscles, and a small incision made over its tip so as to allow a pair 'of forceps to be introduced from without inwards. The forceps are then opened and made to grasp the twisted sac, which is now drawn through tlie oldening and securely fixed there by tendon stitches, which maintain the torsion (Fig. 113). It will be understood that the opening is placed well to the outer side and above the internal ring, that it is completely plugged by the twisted sac, and that the superfluous portion of the latter is cut away. Unless the sac be unusually thick, this method is a very good one, and no recurrence ever takes place at the site of the small incision. The advantage of torsion in tightening up the peritoneum in this region has been esj)ecially pointed out by Sir Charles Ball of Dublin and Prof. Kocher of Berne. 4. In a few cases where the abdominal opening ot the hernia is exceptionally wide, it may be advisable to sew it up with catgut instead of ligaturing or twisting the sac. This applies to vential as well as to ordinary inguinal herniie. It is doubtful which of the first three methods given above is really the best, though personally we incline to the third, which includes torsion with high ligation for most cases, the chief exception being tho.se in which the sac is so thick that it would be difficult to bring it through any small incision in the muscle^'. .Mcliiods of IVai-rowiii^ or Obliterating^ tlie Inguinal C.'anal.—Three methods will be described :— 1. Suturing the conjoined muscles to Poupart’s ligament with replacement of the cord in tlie inguinal canal (Bassini’s method). 2. Suturing the conjoined muscles to Poujiart’s ligament in front of the cord. 3. Complete obliteration of the inguinal canal.

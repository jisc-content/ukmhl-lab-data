COLOTOMY. .357 CHAP. VIII.] of the intestine a purse-string suture of silk is placed, circumscribing an area of, say, an inch in diameter. In this area a linear opening is made, the edges are held aside by fine-toothed forceps, and the glass tube is introduced. The tube is so placed that its lumen is directed upwards, and the .silk suture is firmly knotted round the groove on the tube. A soft rubber tube, some few feet in length, .should have already been fixed to the other end of the glass tube, fhrough which the intestinal contents may pass into a covered jar containing a disinfectant. The rubber tube can be dispensed with. It tends to ]mll the glass tube out of place. In this way the wound can be kept absolutely clean and the neighbourhood of the patient free from odour until the tube comes away after a few days have elapsed. The insertion of the glass tube, which should be large enough to allow semi-solid faecal mafter to pass through it, may be effected so quickly that no leakage occurs before the silk is tied. The tube is supported in position by a thick pad of gauze and wool around it; this dressing is held in place by bandage. A cradle is used to keep off the weight of the bed-clothes, and the rubber tube may be conveniently attached to the side of the cradle and so carried out of the patientâ€™s bed. Provided the tube does not get blocked, it may be left to come away by itself, which usually happens some four or five days after its insertion.

This operation consists in establishing an artificial open- ing (stoma) in the stomach, through the parietes, with the purpose that the patient may be fed through the new “ mouth.” Gastrostomy is carried out in ca.ses of obsti’uction of the gullet, especially in such as are due to malignant disease. Preparaliou of the Patient.—If the patient is no longer able to swallow, the .strength should be supported by nutrient enemata. One such injection, containing an ounce of brandy, may be given just before the oi)eration. There is no need to adopt any especial means for distending the stomach. The body should be well covered up Avith blankets, and the limbs surrounded by hot-water bottles. Deep amesthesia is not required. I have performed the operation when so small an amount of ether has been given that the patient, while complaining of no pain, has yet been ■ dimly conscious of all the steps of the operation. It may be nerformed under eucaine or cocaine injections (2 per cent, solution of either). The quicker the operation can be carried out, within reason, the better.

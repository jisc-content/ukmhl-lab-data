381 CHAPTER XL Operations on the Gall Bladder and the Main Bile-ducts. 1.—CIIOLECYSTOTOJlY. ' By this operation is meant the making of an incision into the gall-bladder through a wound in the abdominal parietes. Its chief indication is for the removal of gall-stones, whether impacted or not. It is also performed in cases of cholecystitis, in simple hydrops or distension with mucus of the gall-bladder—both conditions usually due to impacted gall-stone, but possibly to other causes, such as typhoid fever, hydatid cysts, or obstruction from growths at the transverse fissure. Iiisti'iiineiils required.—Scalpels; bistouries; dis- secting, artery, and pressure forceps; long-bladed dissect- ing forceps ; large pressure forceps for extensive adhesions —e.g., of omentum ; rectangular retractors; spatulae ; blunt hooks; scissoi’s; intestinal and other curved needles; needle-holder; sponge-holders ; special scoops and forceps for dealing with the calculi (the scoops should be more flexible than the ordinary lithotomy ones); Lister’s sinus forceps; long probe ; aspirator, or trocar and cannula. A firm pillow or large sand-bag should be at hand. Tile Opei'iitioii.—The general management of the operation, the preparatioir of the patient, the position of the surgeon and his assistants, conform to the lines already laid down in dealing with abdominal section. Great assistance will be obtained in exposing the gall-bladder region by having a large sand-bag placed behind the patient’s loins, so as to lift up and render convex the c])igastrium. The parietal incision is about three inches in length, and can be enlarged as required. It is best made vertically over the most jiromincnt part of the tumour, when one

.341 CHAP. V.] RESECTION OF INTESTINE. V.—COLECTOMY. The operation for resecting portions of the colon difl'ers in no essential particular from that applied to the small intestine. After the diseased segment has been removed, the two divided ends of the intestine may be brought together and united by sutures, or' any attempt at immediate union may be abandoned, and an artificial anus be established. In colectomy the latter procedure is more frequently . carried out than is the case when the small intestine is dealt with. An artificial anus may be established as a temporary measure, and may be followed by an attempt to close the opening at a later period by a second operation. In such a case the two ends of the divided colon are brought close together, and may even be united partially by a few sutures applied upon the deep or attached aspect of the gut. If, on the other hand, it be intended that the artificial anus should be permanent, then it is well to close the opening in the distal .segment of the bowel. This especially applies to resections carried out low down in the colon. In closing the distal end it is well to turn in the edges a little, and to bring the serous coats of the bowel together so far as is possible. The best position for the incision in the parietes offers .some difficulties. The most practical rule is that which would direct the incision to be made immediately over the tumour when a tumour exists. In any case of doubt a small exploratory incision should be made in the median line, and this may be followed if necessaiy by a second inci.sion directly over the seat of the disease. The hone bobbin will be found to be of much use in the suturing of the large intestine after resection. Mnrphys bntion is also of great use in dealing with the colon, as it is readily and certainly discharged. It is in connection with the colon, indeed, that Murphy’s button will be found to be the most iiseful.

460 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part xii. means of a small electric lamp. The division is then made while the parts are in full view of the operator. After the division of the fistula comes the most delicate part of the operation—the search for secondary fistulae, for burrowing tracts, and for diverticula from the primary sinus. For this examination again are needed a well- stretched sphinctei’, a s})eculum, rapid sponging, a good light, and suitable probes. The finger should search for any tracts of indurated * tissue, and the surgeon should note if the escape of a bead of pus follows pressure in any direction. Any secondary sinuses must be treated as their condi- tion indicates. Those which burrow beneath the mucous membrane should be slit up for their entire length. No object is gained by sparing the mucous membrane, and hesitating and incomplete incisions will always be regretted. Secondary sinuses, which pass away from the rectum, must be liberally slit up. When this involves too great a division of the soft parts, they may be freely opened into the original wound, may be dilated with dressing forceps and the finger, and well scraped with a sharp spoon or .seared with the actual cautery, and then well stuffed with gauze. All the pulpy granulation tiss\;e which is met with about fistulre should in every case be scraped away. The surgeon should endeavour to leave as clean and fresh a wound as possible. In the division of the fistula the anal margin is of neces- sity in every case divided, and in order that the .section of the muscle fibres should be as direct as possible, the knife should always cut its way into the bowel at right angles to the anal margin. If any piles exist, they should be removed at the time of the operation, and all ill-nourished flaps and tags of in- flamed and undermined skin should be cut away.

The sutures should be placed at fairlj’’ close intervals, about 8 to 10 mm. apart. 4. Each .suture is tied in order, but before doing so the surgeon relieves tension as far as possible by the use of the raspatory, and by two short incisions through the soft palate made just within the hamular process. Especial attention should be paid to the extreme anterior end of the cleft, and to the point opposite to the ‘ junction of hai’d and soft palate. The knots made ai’e single surgeon’s oires, so that the ends lie evenly against the palate and cannot irritate the tongue. Note.—In the usual descrijDtion of the o])ei’atioTi the lateral incisions are jjlaced more internally than above described—e.(/. midway between the cleft and the alveolus. As Tillaux pointed out, the branches of the palatine artery are theai cut aci’oss. Placing the incisions close to the alveolus presents no special difficulties, and diminishes the l isk both of hremorrhage and of sloughiaig of the flaps.

The foramen spinosum (transmitting the middle meningeal artery) is, however, placed externally to as well as slightly behind the larger foramen, and will therefore probably be reached first. A sufficient landmark for the two is the eminentia articu- laris on the zygoma, which is situated on the same vertical plane, 3 cm. externally to and slightly below them. When . M. R. Fig. 28.—DIAGRAM OF THE GASSERIAN GANGLION. The dotted tract m.r. is the motor root; Oph., the Ophthalmic Trunk; For. Rot., the aperture in the bone for the Superior Maxillary ; and For. Ov., the Foramen Ovale, through which the Inferior Maxillaiy Division passes. The dotted lines s.s., in the right-hand figure, indicate the lines of section where the entire ganglion is removed ; those in the left-hand figure s.s., the ones made for the modified excision. the foramen ovale has been clearly defined, the foramen rotundum must be sought for 2 cm. in front of it. The Operation.—A rounded flap, including all the tissues down to the bone, is cut with its baSe at the zygoma and its upper edge two inches above this ridge. (Figs. 26 and 27.) This flap lies over the front half of the squamous portion of the temporal bone, and the incision divides the branches of the temporal artery, which are at once secured by forceps. By means of a large trephine and cutting forceps the cor- responding part of the cranial wall is removed, care being taken not to wound the dura mater or the meningeal vessels running in it. The dura mater is now lifted upwards by an elevator from the floor of the middle fossa, working

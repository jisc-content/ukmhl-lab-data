216 CHAPTER V. Excision of Joints and Bones. 0 Oeiicral Coii«!>i4lci':itioiis.—By the teroi “excision of a joint ” is implied the removal of the articular extremi- ties of the bones entering into the formation of the joint, together, necessarily, with the cartilage and synovial mem- brane, the procedure being carried out with the least possible amount of injury to the surrounding soft parts. This definition, while it applies precisely to the usual ex- cisions of the knee and elbow, is allowed also to include the usual excisions of the hip and shoulder in which only the articular extremity of the long bone forming the joint is completely removed. By excising a joint it is often possible to preserve a limb which, but for this operation, would be subjected to amputation. The excision of a bone may apply either to the complete removal of a bone together with its articular extremity, e.ff. the inferior maxilla ; or to the removal of a portion of a bone, e.ff. the diaphysis of the humerus, or the acromial end of the clavicle. liisti'iimciitM Employed.—The following is a list of the instruments that may be required in an excision operation :— Scalpels.

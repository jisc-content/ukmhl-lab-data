8 CHAPTER IT. Ligature of the Arteries of the Upper Limb. THE RADIAL ARTERY. L.iiio of tlio Artery.—A line from tlie centre of the bend of the elbow to the gaj:) between tlie scaphoid bone and the tendons of the extensor ossis and extensor primi internodii pollicis. Position.—The surgeon stands upon the side to be operated on. The limb is in the position of supination, ' and is firmly held by an assistant, who grasps it by the hand and by the upper arm. 1. Lig^atiirc in tlic Lower Tliird of the Forearm. Operation.—An incision about one inch and a quarter in length is made over the line of the pulse, midway between, and parallel with, the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis mu.scles. The cut must not reach below the level of the tuberosity of the scaphoid (Fig. 2). The commencement of the superficial radial vein usually lies over the artery in this situation, and im- mediately under the skin. It should be avoided. The fascia, which is here quite thin, is divided in the line of the original 'wound. The gap between the two tendons is now made manifest. Over, or in close relation to, the artery may be observed the terminal part of the anterior division of the external cutaneous nerve. It may be impossible to separate the venae comites from the artery to a suflicient extent to allow the needle to pass. In such case the ligature must include the veins as well as the artery. V

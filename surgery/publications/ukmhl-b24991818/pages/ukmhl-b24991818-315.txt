EXCISION OF TONGUE. CHAP. III.] 299 Scalpels. Retractors. Blunt hooks. Aneurysm needle. Needles and sutures. The instruments required for the first stage, including ligature of the lingual and dissection of the glands, should be in one dish, whilst those required for the second stage —the actual excision of the tongue—should be kept in a separate dish. The best "as is Mason’s or Hewitt’s. It must be strong, and the blades be capable of wide separation. The “ catch ” fixing the gag when open must be secure. A catch ” is better than a screw. The best cheek retractor is the broad rectangular re- tractor used in nephrectomy operations. It is in every way excellent. The scissors used for cutting out the tongue should be quite straight, and quite flat and strong. They should be longer than the usual pattern, and should end in square blunt points. The'cutting edge should extend up to the very tip. Position.—The patient lies close to the right-hand side of the table. The head and shoulders are well raised, and the arms are folded behind the back. The surgeon stands to the right and the chief assistant to the left. The anaesthetist stands at the head of the table, and by him an assistant who holds the gag and steadies the head. The gag is introduced on the left side of the mouth, is very firndy held, and, with a Mason’s gag, it is a good rule to keep the handle of the gag always against the patient’s ear. A good light is essential. Tlie Operation.—In many cases it is necessary to tie both lingual arteries. The surgeon commences on the side on which the cancerous growth is situated, and that on which the lymphatic glands will therefore require to be dis- sected out. Diiring the first stage the gag is not introduced, but it is often convenient to introduce a loop of silk ligature through the middle of the tongue, so that in case the breathing should become embarrassed traction can be made on it.

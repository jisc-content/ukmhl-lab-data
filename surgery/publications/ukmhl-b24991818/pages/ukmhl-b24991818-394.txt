'^78 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. . [part viii. respects;—The transverse colon and the great omentum are turned upwards, and the under layer of the mesocolon is exposed. An aperture is made in the latter, avoiding the branches of the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Through this aperture the po.sterior wall of the stomach is drawn, a sufficient area being exposed in which to make the anastomosis. Two or three sutures are so applied as to fix the edges of the opening in the mesocolon to the stomach wall. These sutures should only penetrate the outer coats of the stomach. The jejunum, having been picked up and brought into position, is then sewn obliquely to the .stomach in precisely the same manner as already described (Fig. 108). Robson’s bobbin is often used to facilitate the suturing. (From Hiirtmaiin’s “ Chirurgie Gabtro-Intestinale.’’) The transverse colon is raised and part of the stomach has been drawn throngli an aperture made in the transverse mesocolon. The looj) of the jejunum has been fixed to the stomach obliquely, the 0]>ening made between the two organs is being evenly secured all round hv a continuous suttire of silk.

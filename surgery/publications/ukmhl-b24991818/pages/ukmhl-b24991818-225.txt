CHAP. III.] 209 OSTEOTOMY. 1. Osteotomy of the shaft of the femur from the outer side. 2. Macewen’s supracondyloid operation. 1. Osicofoniy of flic Shaft of the Femur from fhe Outer Side.—Tlie patient lies upon the hack, with the knee flexed over a sand bag, upon which the limb is made to rest securely. The surgeon should stand to the inner side of the limb—i.e., between the patient’s legs. An assistant standing opposite to him steadies the limb. The thigh being adducted so as to well expose the outer surface to the operator (as he stands to the inner side of the knee-joint), an incision about one inch in length is carried down to the bone at a point about two inches above the ex- ternal condyle. The in- cision is made upon the outer side of the thigh, is transverse-—i.e., at right angles to the long axis of the femur—and may be made in one cut. The knife passes through the ilio-tibial process of the fascia lata, and runs in front of the biceps muscle. When the knife is withdrawn the osteotome is inserted, and the limb—no longer adducted—is firmly planted upon the sand bag. The osteotome is made to ti’averse the shaft transversely. As the outer part of the bone is here thicker than the inner part, it Avill be found that when two-thirds of the shaft have been divided the bone can usually be quite readily fractured. • It is essential that the division be extensive enoush, and that no premature and violent attempts be made to complete the division of the bone; 2.

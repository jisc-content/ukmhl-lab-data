24f) CHAPTER XII. Excision op the Hip. This operation implies the removal merely of the upper end of the femur, and the scraping away of any diseased tissue wliich may occupy the acetabulum. As in the case of the shoulder-joint, so here also the excision does not in- volve tlie whole joint and the entire articulating surfaces. ISai-kcr’s Operation l»y Anterior Incision.— The patient lies supine, with both thighs fully extended. Tlie surgeon stands in evei’y case on the right side of the patient; one assistant, facing him, holds the affected thigh, another stands beside and to the left of the operator. The most precise and rigorous aseptic measui’es are carried out. The incision commences on the front of the thigh, half an inch below the anterior spinous process of the ilium, and runs downwards and a little inwards for three inches. As the knife sinks into the limb it passes between the tensor vaginoe femoris and glutei muscles on the outside, and the sartorius and rectus on the inside, until it reaches the neck of the femur. This incision does not divide any muscle fibres, nor vessels or nerves of the slightest importance. It is unnecessaiy to carry the deeper part of the incision to the full extent of the external wound. If an abscess is opened up before the joint is reached, its contents are thoroughly flushed out with sterilised hot water, at a temperature of between 105° and 110°, before anything further is done. For this purpose a large three-gallon can is used, with three taps below, to each of which six or eight feet of india-rubber tubing is attached. This can is placed some feet above the operating-table, so as to have a considerable pressure of water. Each of the rubber tubes

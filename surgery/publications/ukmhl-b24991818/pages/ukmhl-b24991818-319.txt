EXCISION OF TONGUE. CHAP. III.] 303 are ligatured and divided. The gland, -svitli one or two contained lymphatic glands, is then dissected out and drawn forwards, the facial vessels being again secured as they pass over the jaw. The prolongation of the gland along Whartonâ€™s duct is drawn out from beneath the mylo- hyoid muscle, and a ligature should be put round the duct before it is divided (to prevent possible contamination of the wound by backward flow of saliva). A lymphatic gland lying under the angle of the jaw {see A, Pig. 88) should be removed at the same time. Whenever the submaxillary gland is removed, a drain should be left for a day or two ; otherwise blood collects in the space. Before sewing up the wound the surgeon should make certain that his ligatures on the divided facial vessels are holding well. The method desciibed above combines the advantages of preliminary ligature of the lingual arteries with excision of the lymjihatic glands most likely to be involved by epitheliomatous deposit.

CHAP. II.] LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. 11 needle should be passed from whichever side is the more convenient. 4. Lrigatuve of the Radial in the Tahatiere Auatoiniqiie. —The radial artery runs over the external lateral ligament of the wrist, just below the styloid pro- cess, . passes under the extensors of the metacarpal bone and first phalanx of the thumb, and crosses the tahatiere. Its course is here represented by a line drawn from the aj)ex of the styloid process of the radius to the posterior angle of the first interosseous space. The hand is placed upon its ulnar border, and is firmly fixed there by an assistant, who at the same time holds the thumb extended and abducted and the fingers straight. O An incision, about one inch in length, is made along the centre of the tahatiere, parallel to the extensor of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, and so placed as to com- mence at the level of the radial styloid process and lie midway between the extensor ossis and the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb. The incision will cross the artery a little obliquely. The cephalic vein of the thumb must be avoided. The artery is ligatured in tlie middle of its course. It will probably be impossible to sepai-ate the vena? comites. THE ULNAR ARTERY. Line of the Artery.—The ulnar in the lower two-thirds of its course in the forearm is represented by a line drawn from the tip of the internal condyle of the humerus to the radial side of the pisiform bone. The curve of the vessel in the upper third of its course is such that a line drawn from the commencement of the artery—at the, middle of the bend of the elbow—to the radial side of the ])isiform bone will scai’cely touch the vessel in any part of its course. The upper third of the artery is too deejsly placed to be exposed for ligature, unless it be actually laid bare in a wound.

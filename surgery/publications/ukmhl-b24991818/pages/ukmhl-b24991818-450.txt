[PAKT X. 43i SURGICAL OPERATIONS. the staff is introduced, and is held in the same manner as in lateral lithotomy. The surgeon inserts the left index finger into the rectum, and steadies the staff with the point of the finger which is pressed against it at the apex of the prostate. The narrow bistoury is now thrust into the median raijhe of the perineum half an inch in front of the anus. It is introduced horizontally, and with the cutting edge directly upwards. The groove in the staff is hit at the IDoint where it is steadied by the finger in the I’ectum. The groove is entered at this point, and by continuing to thrust the knife deeper the apex of the prostate is slightly incised. The membranous urethra is cut through as the knife is being withdrawn, and the external wound is enlai-ged to the extent of about one inch by cutting upwards as the knife is bein" removed. As the urethra is incised the handle of the knife will be pointing almost directly downwards ; as the integuments are divided, the handle will be pointing upwards. Special care must be taken to avoid wounding the bulb. A Little’s director, or similar instrument, is now intro- duced along the groove of the staff into the bladder. It is held in the left hand. The staff is then withdrawn. Guided by the director, which is retained in position until the operation is completed^ the operator gradually worms his right forefinger into the bladder, dilating its orifice. The forceps are now introduced, and the stone is with- drawn. In ordinary cases no lithotomy tube need be employed.

CHAP. XIV.] EXCISION OF UPPER JAW. 253 the hnger and thumb, so as to compress the coronary arteries. The incision is then carried through the median line of the upper lip into the mouth (Fig. 83, a). The superior coronary arteries are at once seized and secured. While the lip is being dealt with the upper part of the wound is being com- pressed by a sponge. In this stage of the operation the following vessels are divided The angu- lar artei’y and the large angular vein, the lateralis nasi artery, the superior coronary, the artery to the nasal septum, and some trifling bi’anches of the infra- orbital. 2. A second in- cision is now carried along the lower mai’- gin of the orbit. At its commencement it starts from the point of the first incision, and ends over the malar bone (Fig. 83, A). 3. The cheek flap thus marked out is now rapidly raised from the bone, and should contain all the soft parts down to the maxilla. No attempt should be made to save the periosteum. In dissecting up this flap the infra-orbital artery is divided. Care should be taken that no blood runs into the moutli, and an assistant should follow the flap with a sponge.

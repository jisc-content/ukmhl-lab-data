241 CHAPTER Xr. Excision of the Knee. The upper limit of the femoral epiphysis will be repre- sented by a horizontal line drawn across the bone at the level of the tubercle for the adductor niagnus. If the whole of the trochlear surface be removed in the incision, the whole of the epiphysis will have been taken away. A single nucleus appeal’s in this epiphysis shortly before birth, and joins the shaft about the twentieth year. The epiphyseal line is intracapsular. The limits of the tibial epiphysis are represented behind and at the sides by a horizontal line that just marks off’ the tuberosities. It includes, therefore, the depression for the insertion of the semimembranosus, and also the facet for the fibula. In front the epiphyseal line slopes downwards on either side to a point on the upper end of the shin, so as to enclose the whole of the tubercle of the tibia. The centre joins the main bone at the twenty-first or twenty-second year. The epiphyseal line is extra-articular. Farabeuf estimates that in a child of about eight years of age it is impossible to remove more than 1 cm. of the tibia, or 1| cm. inch) of the femur, without approaching dangerously to the epiphyseal lines. After puberty {e.g. in a youth of seventeen years) it is possible to remove 1^ cm. of the tibia, and 2^ cm. (1 inch) of the femur, without compromising the epiphyseal lines. The popliteal artery is so placed that it is in greater risk of being wounded when the tibia is sawn than when the lower part of the femur is beitig removed.

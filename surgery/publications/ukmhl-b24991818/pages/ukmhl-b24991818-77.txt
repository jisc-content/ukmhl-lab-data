()I oii Ar. V.] LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. just given. The centre of the incision should correspond to the point of exit of the artery. After dividing the skin and superficial fascia, with a few cutaneous nerves, the gluteus inaxiinus is reached, covered by its fascia. The incision runs parallel with the fibres of the muscle. These fibres are separated in the line of the wound until the thickness of the muscle has been traversed. A muscular branch—from the siiperficial division of the artery—may here be met with, and will form a guide to the truiik. The deep fascia between the gluteus muscles is reached, - and the contiguous margins of the gluteus medius and pyriformis muscles are exposed. The gluteus maximus is now relaxed by placing the fully extended thigh ui)on the table. The interval between the gluteus medius and ])yriformis is opened up with retractors, and the upper margin of the sciatic notch defined. The superficial division of tlie. artery passes between the two muscles, and leads the operator’s finger to the main trunk. The ligature should be applied as far within the notch as possible—almost within the pelvis— inasmuch as the artery breaks up into its two divisions as soon as it has cleared the notch Care must be taken to include neither the nerve nor the vein. In order to obtain a fuller view of the vessel, some fibres of the great sacro-sciatic ligament may require to be divided.

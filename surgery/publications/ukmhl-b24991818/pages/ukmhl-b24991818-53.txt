CHAP. IV.] LIGATURB OF ARTERIES. 37 assistant holds the tibialis anticus toward the tibia with a retractor. The outer border of the tibia having been made out with the forefinger, the artery will be found to the outer side of it, lying on the interosseous mem- brane. It is covered and held down by a moderately dense con- nective tissue. The artery is now exposed, a second retractor being used to repress the extensor com- munis (Fig. IG). The veme comites lie so close to the artery, and in such a posi- tion, and send so many transverse 1 (ranches across it, that it is prac- tically impossible to .separate them with certainty. They will be pro- bably enclosed in the ligature. The nerves lie to the outer side of the artery. The needle is passed from without inwards. The neiwe may not be seen. It may not join the artery until the middle third of the limb is reached. It, however, usually meets the vessel at the junction of the upper with the second fourth. Comment.—TJie only difficulty in this operation is the finding of the gap between the tiljialis anticus and the extensor com- munis digitoruin. Not the least indication of it exists upon the surface of the deep fascia. The “white line” described by some authors is a myth, so far at least as this segment of the limb is concerned, d'he gap required is to be felt ratber than seen.

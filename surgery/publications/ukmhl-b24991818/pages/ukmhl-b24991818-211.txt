AMPUTATIONS. CHAP. XVIII.] 195 limb a little way below the base of the great trochanter, and is carried obliquely across the anterior aspect of the thicrh to meet the vertical incision about two inches below O its point of commencement (Fig. 66). This incision concerns at first only the skin and the sub- cutaneous tissue. It cannot be made with one sweep of the knife, and the limb must be so held and so rotated as to make the tis.sues meet the knife. (2) The femoral sheath is now exposed at the upper part of the inci- sion, and the vessels are laid bare by dissection. The common femoral artery is ligatured in two places close together, and is divided between the ligatures. The femoral vein is secured in the same manner, and then cut across at the same level as the artery. (3) The skin is freed all round the whole length of the incision, and is allowed to retract a little. The integuments, however, are not especi- ally dissected up. (4) The stout scalpel is now taken, and is carried through the muscles in the outer flap. In this way are divided the sartorius, the rectus, and the tensor vaginai femoris. The retraction of these muscles will expose'’the external circumflex artery, which is secured between two ligatures and divided. Carry the knife backwards, rotate the limb in, and divide the insertion' of the gluteus maximus. Rotate the limb out and divide the psoas muscle. At this point the internal circumflex artery is expo.sed, secured, and Fig. GO.—nLSAP.TICL’LATIOX AT THE HIP- JOINT BY AN ANTERIOR RACKET IN- CISION.

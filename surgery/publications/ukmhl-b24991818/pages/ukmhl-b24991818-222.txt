20fi CHAPTER n. Osteotomy for Faulty Ankylosis of the Hip-joint. This measure is carried out in certain cases of rigid anky losis of the hip-joint, resulting from disease, in which the limb has assumed a faulty position and all milder methods of treatment have failed. In the most usual deformity the thigh is flexed, adducted, and a little rotated in. The object of the operation is to bring the limb straight. The possibility of securing a movable joint at the same time may or may not be contemidated by the operator. 1. Through llic IVcck of llie Femur (Fig. 70, a). This operation is best ]ierformed with the osteotome. The Operation.—The patient lies upon the sound hip, and the surgeon stands to the outer side of the limb. An assistant steadies the thigh and pelvis. A longitudinal incision about three-fourths of an inch in length is made just above the great trochanter and in the axis of the neck of the bone. The knife is carried well dow'n to the bone. The osteotome follows the knife, and on reaching the femur is turned on its axis so that its cutting edge is at right angles to the axis of the neck. A few blows from the mallet will suffice to divide the bone. These operations as here described are carried out by the subcutaneous method ; but, as has been already ob- served, the surgeon need not be sparing of his incision, nor of the exposure of the deeper parts, if only he has taken care to avoid the possibility of wound infection. 2. Thi'oiigli tlie Shaft ot the Femur below the Trochanters.—The osteotomy is carried out precisely as in the procedure just described. The incision is longitudinal, is placed over the outer

[part III. 132 8VR0ICAL OPERATIONS. a flap be cut, a pocket is made in which eftusions may collect. Hcemorrhage.—The two dorsal digital arteries will be cut at the corners of the dorsal incision. They are small, and usually do not need to be secured. If the flap has been well cut, the two plantar digital arteries will not be wounded, but will lie buried in the flap until they anastomose at its free end. They may readily be cut if in dissecting the flap back the knife is not kept close to the bone. They also lie near to the sides of the joint (plantar aspect), and may be easily wounded in care- less disarticulation. 2. Amputation or Disarticulation of tlie Piialang^cs of tlic Four Outer Toes.—In operat- ing upon the smaller toes the neighbouring digits should be held aside by the assistant by means of sterilised tapes. It is well not to use too long a scalpel. The terminal phalanges may be removed by the operation just described. In disarticulation of the second phalanx use the oval or racket incision (Fig. 42, a), and proceed precisely as in the corresponding operation in the hand (see page 87). Ihmxorrhage,—Two dorsal and two plantar digital arteries are found cut in the lateral edges of the wound. The dorsal will require no attention ; the latter may be twisted. In amputation throxxgh the first plutlaxix employ the circular method. Make a circular cut round the phalanx at the level of the web; cut to the bone. As the knife crosses the dorsum flex the toe so as to cut the extensor Fig. 42.—A, Disarticulation of the second phalan.x of a toe by the racket or oval incision; B, Dis- articulation of the great toe by the racket or oval incision.

SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part III. 108 insinuate the knife behind the ulna, and its movements in that position must be assisted with the left fingei's. While the muscular tissue is being divided the assistant flexes the hand. The two flaps are now drawn ujj to the level of the saw-line, and the remaining soft parts are divided at that level to fully clear the bones. This is effected by what the French surgeons call the incision en 8 cle chiffre^' (^^ig- 35). The knife is so made to pass across the front and back of the limb as to follow the outlines of the bones and to well sever the interosseous membrane. The hand is kept supine, and both the anterior and posterior incisions are made from left to right, and both are commenced by the heel of the knife and com- pleted by its point. The threefold re- tractor having been applied, the bones are sawn in the manner already described. Some surgeons advise that the me- dian, ulnar, and radial nerves should be I’esected from the anterior flap. Hcemorrhage.—The i*adial artery will run the whole length of the anterior flap, and be cut near its outer border on the inner side of the supinator longus. The i-adial nerve accompanies it. The ulnar artery will be cut shortei', will be in front of the bone, and between the flexor sublimis and flexor profundus digitorum. The anterior interosseous vessels will be divided immediately in front of the inter- osseous membrane. The posterior interosseous artery will be cut long, and will be found between the superficial and deep muscles. The more conspicuous nerves form good guides to the divided vessels. The black and white arrows mark the * course of the knife.

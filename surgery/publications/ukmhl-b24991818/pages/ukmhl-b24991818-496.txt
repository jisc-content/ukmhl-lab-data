[PAKT XIV. 480 SURGICAL ORERATIONS. Until recently it was the custom, after excision of the breast, to bandage the arm of the same side against the chest wall—making, in fact, a splint of it—to keep the dressings at rest. It was usual to maintain the patient’s arm in this position for ten days or so, allowing movement neither at shoulder nor at elbow joint, and sometimes even confining the fingers and hand closely against the thorax. Such confinement is, of course, irksome to the patient, and apt to be followed by stillness of the joints, which is but slowly recovei’ed from. The axillary vein may become adherent to the side of the chest, and circulation be therel?y impeded. Moreover, keeping the arm pressed against the side of the chest encourages axillary pei'spiration, and may ' thus favour infection of the wound. As long as the shoulder-joint is kept at rest, freedom of the elbow and hand cannot intei’fere in the least with the healing of the wound. The best way is to envelop the axillary and pectox'al region with a large dressing, which is kept securely in jdace by a figure-of-eight bandage applied whilst the assistant supports the arm at about a right angle from the chest wall. The arm is subsequently supported on a pillow at a little less than this angle.

4G6 [part Xlll. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. line is reached. Care must be taken not to wound the trunk of the occipital artery. The sj)ot already indicated as most suited for the introduction of the trephine will lie just below the latter line. â–  The bone here is very thin. The lateral sinus lies opposite to the superior curved line above and the mastoid process in front. The spot for the trephine is a little behind and below the mastoid foramen, and the direction in which it should work is upwards and slightly inwards. The bone may be removed Avith the trephine, or, if more convenient, Avith the gouge. The dura mater is incised, the needle is employed, and the abscess is opened and drained in the manner already described. If the skin and soft parts on being released are found to overlap the trephine-hole, they must be divided in such a Avay as to leave the latter quite clear. Mr. Barker recommends that as soon as the bone is exposed the mastoid foramen should be examined. If ])us has found its Avay along the groove of the lateral sinus, it may induce symptoms akin to those of cerebellar absce.ss, and an examination of the foramen may reveal pus escaping, since that opening leads dmect into the groove for the sinus.

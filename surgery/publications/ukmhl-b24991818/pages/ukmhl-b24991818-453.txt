SUPRAPUBIC CYSTOTOMY. CHAP. II.] 437 The purpose for which the bladder has been opened is then carried out. If for the removal of a large calculus, this is extracted by scoop and finger, or by forceps. If for vesical tumour, this is removed witli the aid of cutting forceps or curved scissors. If for prostatic enlargement, the mucous membrane over the projection is incised and enucleation carried out by the fingers, aided perhaps by an elevator or forceps. The prostatic urethra should be as far as possible respected. of tlie Bladder.â€”This is an ideal method of concluding the operation whenever it can be carried out. The bladder wound should be closed by suture in children, and in healthy adults provided that the viscus itself is normal. It is not wise to attempt it in aged subjects, in those who have cystitis, or in cases where the operation has been protracted, and the margins of the bladder wound are much bruised, as in the extraction of a large calculus. The application of the sutures is comparatively easy in children and in thin adults. It is difficult in the corpulent. The opening into the bladder is fixed, and is held up by two blunt hooks, one inserted at each extremity of the wound. By means of these hooks the margins of the in- cision are kept steady and parallel with one another. Fine catgut or kangaroo tendon should be employed. The sutures should be interrupted, and should be in two rows or layers. The deeper series should include the mucous membrane. The surface layer should include the other coats. All sutures should be introduced by means of a curved needle in a holder, and be very closely applied. A small gauze drain is introduced into the lower part of the parietal wound, which is then closed. In many cases, however, such as for removal of an en- larged prostate, no attempt at suturing should be made, the urine being allowed to drain freely through the wound until the latter spontaneously closes. A dry dressing is applied.

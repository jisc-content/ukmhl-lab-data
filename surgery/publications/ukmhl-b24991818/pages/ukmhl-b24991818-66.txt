Operation.—Tli% position of the surgeon and of the patient has been already indicated. An incision two indies in length is commenced a little above Poupart’s ligament (i.e. on the abdomen), and is carried downwards parallel with the line of the artery. In dividing the layer of fatty tissue which covers the fascia lata, care must be taken • not to injure any of the lymphatic glands of the re- gion, and to avoid the super- ficial veins, notably the super- ficial epigastric and superficial circumflex iliac. The cribri- form fascia is now divided in the original line, and especial care must be taken not to wound the superficial arteries, the two which usually come nearest to the incision being the supei'ior external pudic and the superficial epigastric. The crural branch of the genito-crural nerve lies upon the sheath of the artery, but upon the outer side of the vessel. The sheath being clearly exposed and carefully opened, the needle is [massed from the inner side (Fig. 23). Comment. — By starting from the level of the centre of Poupart’s ligament, the in- cision is placed to the outer side of the line of the vessels, and the vein is thus more certainly avoided. When the vein is at all distended, it is apt to overlap the artery. Fig. 2:?.—LIG.VTUHE or lUGHT COMMON KEMOK.-U. .VKTEUY AT THE BASE or SCARPA’s TIUANGLK.

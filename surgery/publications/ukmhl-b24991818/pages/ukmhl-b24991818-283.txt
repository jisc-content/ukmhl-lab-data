PART V.] 267 TENOTOMY. tendon. The nerve being then held aside, the tendon is divided. Jioth in the class-room and in practice I have seen a prominent and cord-like ilio-tibial band divided in the place of tlie biceps. In some thin and muscular subjects the lower- portion of this fascial band may feel very tendon-like. Numerous contracted bands of fascia may come into view after tenotomy of the biceps for contracted knee Some may need division. They are, howe^'er, better left alone, as they usually yield under extemsion, and in dealing with them by tenotomy unexpected vessels may be wounded. Seiiiitendinosus and Semiviemhranosus,— The same observations as have been applied to the biceps apply generally to these tendons. Tliey are most conveniently divided exactly opposite the spot selected for tenotomy of the biceps. The tenotome is introduced upon the outer side of the tendon, and is passed beneath it. The steps of the little operation need not be repeated. In one case Mr. Jacobson met with “most profuse” hajinorrliage in dividing the .semimembranosus tendon in a girl of sixteen. He considered that the bleeding— which was checked by pre.ssure —proceeded from the superior internal articular artery. Contraction.—The exact anatomy of the palmar fascia should be borne in mind, and especially the - manner in which the digital processes of the fascia are di.sposed of, and the connections of the ultimate slips of the fascia with the integument of the tinger-s. It will bo I'emembered that each flivision of the palmar fascia sends five slips. 1. A central one to the sheath of the flexor tendons: 2. One on either .side to the skin at the clelt of the fingers. 3. One to the supei-ficial transverse ligament on either .side. In Hupuytren’s contraction all these may be hypertrophied. Open Excision of the Contracted Bands.—The patient’s hand must be sedulously cleaned with alcoholic

3U CHAP. IV.] LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. 3. ill tlic Lower Third of I lie Le;;. Operation.—Tlie position is the same, only tlic foot need not be so much rotated in. An incision, two to two and a half inches in length, is made in the line of the artery, and just to the outer side of tlie tendon of the tibialis anticiis. The tendon must be identified beyond doubt before the operation is proceeded with. The deep fascia—here known as the upper band of the anterior annular ligament—is divided in the same line ; and the space between the tibialis anticus tendon and the tendon of the extensor pollicis is defined. Both these tendons will be exposed. The artery lies be- tween them, on tlie front of the tibia, and embedded in a consider- able quantity of fatty connective tissue. The foot is a little flexed, the extensor pollicis tendon is drawn to the outer side by a small blunt hook, and the exposed artery is easily secured. The nerve lies to the outer side, and the needle should 'be passed from the nerve. As the vessel is quite superficial, the veme comites may be separated so as to make room for the needle (Fig. 17). Comment.—The operation is without difficulty, if one tendon be not mistaken for another. The nerve may lie in front of the artery. The two malleolar arteries—vessels aliout the size of the posterior auricular—^conie off just above the ankle- joint. There are these objections to the operation in this situation ; the upper band of the annular ligament is Fig. 17. — LIGATURE OK RIGHT ANTERIOR TIHIAL ARTERY (lower THIRD).

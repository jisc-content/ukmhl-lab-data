CHAP. VI.] .34.3 INTESTINAL ANASTOMOSIS. 2. Lateral Anastomosis with Mayo Kobsoii’s Bobbin.—The only difference between this method and that just described is the following : After the posterior continuous suture has been made, the intestine opened, and the second suture carried half-way round the opening, a decalcified bone bobbin is insei’ted, and the suturing con- tinued in double row in front of the bobbin. The use of the latter is supposed to render the operation quicker and the suturing easier. As already noted, it is probable that the bone bobbin remains in place only a few hours, as the digestive juices cause it to be rapidly absorbed. 3. Lateral Anastomosis with Murphy’s Button. —This is the quickest method but the least trustworthy, as it depends on a slough being formed, and involves a hea^'y metal body being left in the intestine, which may easily give trouble later. It is, however, so simple that it can be effected in a few minutes, and no detailed descri[)- tion is required beyond that alread}' given (page 330). Murphy’s button is best suited, and is indeed well suited, for anastomosis involving the colon.

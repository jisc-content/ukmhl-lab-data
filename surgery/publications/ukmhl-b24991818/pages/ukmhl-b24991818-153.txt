CHAP. X.] 137 AMPUTATIONS. The plantar flap should contain all the soft parts down to the bone The foot having been extended, the dorsal incision is made. It should be parallel with the plantar cut, and should join the lateral parts of the plantar flap about one inch from their points of commencement. In other words, this little flap is about one inch in length. The flap must include all the soft parts down to the bone. The extensor tendons should be divided when the flap is about half separated. In dividing the bones, the plantar flap should be care- fully protected by an ivory spatula. Each bone should be sawn separately from the dorsal aspect with a fine narrow saw. The rude crushing of the bones with cutting forceps is not to be advised. It is to be remembered that the shafts of the metatai’sal bones are embraced by the interossei muscles. These must be cleanly divided before the saw is applied. The cicatrix comes upon the dorsum of the foot. Hceinorrhage.—In the plantar flap six arteries (the digital) may possibly require to be secured. One will be found opposite to each of the four interosseous spaces, a fifth opposite the outer side of the fifth metatarsal, and a sixth opposite the inner side of the first metatarsal. The two latter vessels may not require to be secured. The largest vessel is that opposite the first interosseous space. Vessels similarly placed will be divided in the dorsal flap. Probably none will require, attention except the artery (the first dorsal interosseous) that is cut opposite the gap between the first and second metatarsal bones. I.’*

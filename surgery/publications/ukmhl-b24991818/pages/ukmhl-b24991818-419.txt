40.3 URETERO-LITHOTOM Y. CHAP. XII.] in the renal pelvis-or ureter; but in ordinary cases this may be done with success, and such suturing should be employed as a routine measure. In any case due pro- vision should be made for drainage of the wouml. In order to expose tlie greater part of the ureter from the renal pelvis down to near the bladder, a very long incision (lumboilio-inguinal) is advocated by Mr. H. Morris. This incision commences under the last rib, passes forwards and downwards across the ilio-costal space, curves round the iliac crest one inch to the inner side of the anterior superior spine, runs parallel with Poupartâ€™s ligament, and ends nearly at the external abdominal ring. The peritoneum must on no account be opened, and the spermatic vessels in the male, the ovarian in the female, must be carefully avoided. If an impacted stone be detected it should, if jiossible, be pushed upwards into the dilated portion of the ureter, which is then incised. After the removal of the stone, the incision in the ureter is closed by sutures.

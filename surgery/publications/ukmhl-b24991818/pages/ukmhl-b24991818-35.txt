Operation.—The patient is placed upon the back, close to the edge of the table, and has the shoulders raised. The arm is at right angles to the body, and is held horizontally. The sui’geon may place himself between the arm and thorax when about to secure either artery. An incision, about three inches in length, is made along the line of the artery. It commences at the middle of the outlet of the axilla, at the junction of its anterior and Fig. 8.—UGATUUE OF THE BHACIUAI.

The knife should be held with the blade horizontal. After the integuments and fascia have been divided, the inner margin of the coraco-brachialis ^should be thoroughly exposed. This muscle, with the musculo cutaneous ner^'o, is then drawn gently outwards. The position of the arteiy may now be determined with the finger. In exposing it the median nerve is at once made evident, and should be drawn outwards by means of a small blunt hook. Tlie internal cutaneous nerve should be gently displaced in- wards. The veme comites need to be well demonstrated. The artery having been cleared, the needle is passed from within outwai-ds (Fig. 9).

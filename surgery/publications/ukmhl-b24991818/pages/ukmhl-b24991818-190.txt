174 CHAPTER XV. UlSAUTICULATION AT THE IvNEE-JoiNT. The following iiictiiod^ are here' described :— 1. Disarticulation by lateral flaps (Stephen Smith’s opei-ation). 2. Disarticulation by elliptical incision (Bauden’s operation.) 1. Disarticulation by Lateral Flaps.— Smith's OjJeration.)—The hap consists of the integuments only, the posterior muscles being divided transversely about the level of the articulation. Instruments. — An amputating-knife with a blade 5 to 6 inches in length; a stout scalpel; six pressure forceps; artery and dissecting forceps; retractors; scissors, etc. Position.—The patient lies upon the back, and is so placed that the middle of the thigh rests upon the lower margin of the table. The sound limb is secured out of the way. The surgeon stands to the outer side of the right leg, to the inner side of the left. Oiie assistant, placed at the extremity of the limb, holds the leg and manipulates it as required. The second assistant stands facing the surgeon, and attends to the flap, the sponging, etc. Oferation.—The flaps are of somewhat semilunar out- line. The.incision commences in front, in the median line, about one inch below the tubercle of the tibia. It is carried in a curved manner across the most piominent part of the outer side of the leg, and is then made to slope upwards to reach the middle line at the posterior aspect of the limb. 11 terminates as a vertical cut opposite the centre of the interarticular line.

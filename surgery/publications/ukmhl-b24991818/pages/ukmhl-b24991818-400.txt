SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [pakt viii. 384 success. The proceeding also is not free from risk, and is to be condemned. Jn some cases the surgeon has succeeded in dislodging an impacted calculus in the cystic duct by means of fre- quent syringing through the fistulous opening after the operation had been completed. It is, however, unsatisfactory to leave an imjjacted calculus in either of the ducts ; it is better to remove it by direct incision. The operator should do his utmost to convince himself that all obstacles in the way of the bile- flow are removed before completing the operation. The treatment of such stones as are impacted so low down in the duct as not to be reached from the gall bladder is dealt with in the succeeding section. The operation is concluded by completing the suturing of the gall-bladder to the edges of the peritoneum, fascia, and muscular aponeurosis. The gall-bladder is held in position while the sutui’es are being introduced. The sand-bag should be removed from the lumbar region before the suturing is performed. The best suture in a straightforward case is an inter- rupted suture of catgut, which includes the cyst wall, the parietal peritoneum, and the muscular aponeurosis, but not the skin or the muscles themselves. Silk sutures ai’e apt to give trouble later on. A drainage-tube is introduced into the gall-bladder, the ]iarts are cleared, and a simple absorbent dressing capable of being frequently and readily changed is applied. Tlie rest of the wound is closed by sutures of silkworm- gut, two of which forextra safety may include the gall-bladder. When the gall-bladder is so retracted that it cannot be readily stitched to the parietes, a rubber drain should be fixed in it by a purse-string suture (passing through the wall of the tube) and then packed round with gauze.

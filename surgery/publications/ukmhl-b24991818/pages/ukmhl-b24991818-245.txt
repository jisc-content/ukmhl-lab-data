EXCISION OF JOINTS. 229 CHAP. VII.] over the internal condyle. Through this small lateral incision the point of the condyle is bared and the attach- ment of the internal ligament separated. Turning to the main wound, and using the rugine rather than the knife, the ojierator decorticates the external condyle, separating the external lateral ligament, exposes the head of the radius, detaches the triceps tendon together with the periosteum, denudes the olecranon and the margins of the sigmoid cavity, and detaches the inser- tion of the brachialis anticus. The bones of the forearm are now luxated forwards, and are divided with a fine saw. The inner segment of the humerus is in the next place freed of all its attachments, and, the bone being now bare, the saw is applied and the required section made. After-treatment.—After the operation the limb must be placed upon a suitable splint, and the bones so adjusted that the greater diameters of the bony surfaces correspond and do not cross. The hand should be in the mid-position between pronation and supination, and the elbow be very slightly bent—so slightly that the forearm will be nearer to the extended posture than to the position it occupies when at right angles to the arm. The precise angle recommended by most surgeons is an angle of 135®,

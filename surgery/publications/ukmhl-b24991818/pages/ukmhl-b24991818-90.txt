CHAPTER III. Operations upon the Nerves of the Upper anh Lower Extremities. the median nerve. 0|»<‘i'iitioiis.—(a) In the arm the nerve can be exposed through such an incision as is employed to secure tlie brachial artery, e.g., in the middle of the arm. {b) At the wrist it is readily exposed through an incision about one inch and a half in length, which is parallel with the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis and * close to its ulnar side. A superficial vein or so may be cut, the fascia is divided, and the nerve can at once be brought into view. THE ULNAR NERVE. Opci’sitions.—(a) Above the centre of the arm the nerve may be exposed by an incision parallel to the line of the bi’achial arteiy, and half an inch to the inner side of it. In exposing the nerve care must be taken to avoid injury to the venae comites of the brachial artery, the nerve of Wrisburg, and the ulnar collateral nerve, all of which are in near association with the trunk sought for. (6) The ulnar nerve is very conveniently exposed just above the internal condyle. The incision should be about one inch and three-quarters in length, and should lie upon the line for the nerve already given. The cut should extend to within about half an inch of the internal condyle. The nerve is found to lie along the back of the internal inter- muscular septum with the inferior profunda artery, which is placed to its outer side. (c) Just above the wrist the nerve may be exposed by.

CHAP. XIII.] ARTHRECTOMY. 251 Finally, the cartilages and hones must be well ex- amined. Patches of softened or eroded cartilage may be sliced off, and points of caries in the bones freely removed with a gouge. The bleeding is arrested by the pressure of a sjionge, which is maintained as long as possible, and by means of pressure forceps. Ligatures are but seldom required. The articulation is then well washed out with sterilised warm water, well sponged, and dried. The limb is placed upon the splint prepared for it, and the patellar ligament having been united by many points of chromicised catgut, the wound is closed with silkworm gut. Drainage-tubes should be avoided whenever possible, and in a large percentage of the cases they can be dispensed with, provided that the margins of the wound are not too closely approximated. If drains be considered necessary, one should be inserted into the posterior angle of the wound on each side.

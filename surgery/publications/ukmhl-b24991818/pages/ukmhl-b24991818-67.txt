")1 CHAPTER V. Ligature of the Iliac Arteries—External, Common AND Internal. EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. / TAne of the Artery:—A line drawn on the .surface of the abdomen from a spot about a finger’s breadth to tlie left of and below the navel, to a point midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis. The upper third of this line represents the common iliac, the lower two-thirds the external iliac. ^^ethods of Apyroachiny the Artery.—The iliac arteries, including the external iliac, can be approached in one of two - ways : I, By opening the abdomen and by directly exposing the vessel, 'rids is called the intraperitoneal method. 2, By means of a lateral incision, which divides all the structures of the abdominal wall with the exception of the peritoneum. The peritoneum is pushed aside, and the artery is reached without opening the serous cavity. This is called the extraperitoneal method. Of these two methods, the 'former or intraperitoneal jjlan is undoubtedly the better in dealing with the common or the internal iliac artery. In ligaturing the external iliac ve.ssel, the two methods are of about equal value, the balance, if any, being in favour of the extraperitoneal measure. 1. Tlic Old or Extraperitoneal Illctliod. Preparation and Position of the Patient.—The bowels should have been well evacuated, and if there be much flatulent distension of the abdomen, the operation, if not urgent, should be postponed until such complication has been dealt with. The pubic hair should be shaved when the skin is being prepared.

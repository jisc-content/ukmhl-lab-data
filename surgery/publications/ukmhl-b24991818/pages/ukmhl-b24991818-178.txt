1(32 [PAET III. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. osseous iiienibraiie divided, the tibia and fibula are sawn through ; the posterior tibial nerve is dissected out and removed. Deep sutures may be passed between the muscular masses upon the front and'back of the limb. Ifcemorrhage.—The anterior tibial artery is cut in the anterior flap, in front of the interosseous space. The posterior tibial and peroneal vessels are divided pos- teriorly, the former about the middle of the flap, and the latter in a line with the fibula. The internal saphenous vein may be cut in making the internal vertical incision. It usually, however, lies wholly in the posterior flap, at the lower and inner angle of which it is found divided. 3. Tcalc’s Aiii|iiitalioii by a l.arg;c Anterior Flap.—The lower third of the leg is considered to be a particularly favourable position for the practice of Teale’s amputation. The circumference of the limb having been taken at the level of the future saw-line, the anterior flap is so marked out that in its length as well as in its breadth it shall be equal to one-half the circumference. The posterior flap should be one-fourth the length of the anterior flap, and will include the remaining half of the circumference of the limb. The lateral incisions follow the mai’gins of the tibia and fibula. The limits of the greater flap may be con- veniently marked out upon the skin with ink. The position of the surgeon and his assistants has been already indicated. The anterior flap may be commenced on the inner side of the limb on the right side, and on the outer aspect on the left side. The two lateral incisions should be made by cutting from above downwards. It should be remembered that the airterior flap is rectangular, and of the same size all the way down. The incision marking out the great flap should at first concern the skin only. The incision is then deepened down to the bones. The foot should be extended while the tendons at the end of the flap are being divided.

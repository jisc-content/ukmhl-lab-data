328 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [pabt viii. The extremities of each suture are knotted together, and the ends cut short. Much trouble is saved, and the inconvenience of a long, wet, and sticky thread is avoided, if separate threaded needles are prepared for each suture. If the supply of needles be limited, the thread carried by each needle may serve for two, or at the very utmost for three, sutures. No form of intestinal suture can surpass Lembert’s for general usefulness. c. Tlie Iiivag-iiiatioii Method.—This has been applied only in instances in which the whole circumference of the bowel has been divided. Maunsell's Method. — The principle of this method is to secure close apposition of the ends of the gut by a row of sutures which pass through all the coats of the intestine from within outwards, and Avith the knots placed on the inside of the gut. The portion of the intestine having been excised, the two ends of the bowel are brought together by two temporary sutures which pass through all the coats of both ends of the gut. One suture is placed at the mesenteric attachment of the bowel 6, and the other at the free margin a (Fig. 96, a). The ends of these sutures— which are loosely knotted—are left long. An opening is now made at c (Fig. 96, b) in that segment of gut Avhich is the larger of the two—i.e. in the proximal part. The in- cision is on the free border of the bowel, and in its long axis. It will be placed about an inch from the free end of the gut, and its size will depend upon that of the gut to be invaginated. The ends of the ligatures a and h are intro- duced into the lumen of the incised bowel, and are brought out through the incision c (Fig. 96, b). They are then dragged up so as to invaginate the bowel, and ultimately to Fig. 95.—lembert’s suture.

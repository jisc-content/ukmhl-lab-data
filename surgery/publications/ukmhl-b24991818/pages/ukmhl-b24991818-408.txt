SURGICAL OPERATIONS. .392 [part VIII. employment in skilled hands there is now less need to pierce the kidney in various directions with an exploring needle, or to disturb it from its connections and to brine it out into the wound. The operation is shortened, and the degree of renal injury materially de- creased. It may possibly be said that the surgeon is rarely justihed in ex- ploring a kidney for stone unless the X-rays have given positive indication of its presence. It must. however, be again ob- served that a stone has been apparently indicated by a shadow in the ski- agraph, and has been proved on exploration not to exist. On the other hand, stones of considerable size have not been indicated by skiagraphs taken by com- petent operators. In- creased precision in the skiagraphy of the kidney is certainly to be ex- pected. In the great majority of cases the calculi are found at the orilice of the ureter, in the pelvis (especially its lower segment), or in one of the calyces. The incision should be made through the posterior wall of the pelvis (Fig. no, A). The incision should always be long enough to admit the finger, and should be placed directly over the stone. It is Fig. 110.—VEimCAI. SECTION THROUGH THE LONG AXIS OF KIDNEY. {From a specimen in the London Hospital Museu7n.) The dotted line passing through the upper end of the ureter and into the jielvis indicates the best incision for reaching calculi in the latter or in one of the calyces (b). A section through the convexity of the corte.x is seen to divide a number of arteries and veins of considerable size. .“V, D, Columns of Bertin and large vessels cut across; C, Py ramids of Slalpighi.

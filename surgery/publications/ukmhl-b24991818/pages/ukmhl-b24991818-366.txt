[PAET vm. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 350 cleanly divided to the full length of the wound. It is well to commence the division close to the anterior border of the quadratus lumbornm. The subperitoneal fat is now reached, and the first stage of the operation is completed. No director is needed, and in no operation is that dangerous weapommore out of place. The parts should not be divided Avith scissors. All that is needed is a scalpel and a pair of dissecting forceps. The operator will seldom be delayed by the need of applying pressure forceps to a bleeding point. The chief error in this stage of the operation is due to the ignoring of the transversalis fascia and the failure to completely divide that structure. Second Stage.—The gut is now sought for. When great distension of the abdomen exists, the colon very fre- quently bulges at once into the wound as soon as the tissues around it have been freed by the finger. Failing such an appearance, the forefinger is introduced into the subperitoneal tissue and the colon is sought for. The finger folloAvs the anterior surface of the quadratus lumborum, and seeks for the angle which exists betw'een this muscle and the psoas. It is towards this angle that the non peritoneal surface of the colon faces in cases where no mesocolon exists. In seeking for this part the lower end of the kidney will be felt, and it must be remembei’ed that the bowel lies on a plane anterior to it. It is essential that the subperitoneal fat be well opened up with the examining finger or fingers. The exposure of the non-distended bowel is impossible unless this be done. In corpulent subjects an immense thickness of tissue will have to be ploughed through before the colon is reached. The bowel may perhaps be recognised in the depths of the wound by the thickness of its coats or by the presence of a scybalous mass. In such case it should be gently freed and drawn into the more superficial part of the wound for examination.

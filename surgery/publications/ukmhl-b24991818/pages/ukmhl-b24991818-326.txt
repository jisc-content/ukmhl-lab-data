310 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part VIII. ward, tlie position of the bladder must be defined before the knife is used. If the hand has to be introduced, the incision must of necessity be increased. There is often a disposition not to make the wound large enough. More harm may be done by rough efibrts to drag a solid growth through a small incision than by a liberal extension of the incision in the median line. In certain cases, as soon as the wound has been com- pleted, a large sponge may be at once introduced into the pelvis. It is retained there during the operation, and, by absorbing any blood that finds its way into Douglas’s pouch, saves sponging at a later stage. The intestines must be prevented from protruding, either by the introduction of a flat artificial sponge or by the fingers of an assistant. One of those present should be entrusted with the responsibility of taking count of all sponges introduced into the abdomen. The omentum often gives much trouble, especially the fine thin omentum of yoiuig children, by clinging to the fingers and to sponges, and by becoming entangled with instruments. It may be necessary to keep it out of the way by means of a long narrow sponge attached to slender forceps. 2. Treatment ot Adhesions.—Adhesions must be dealt with according to common surgical principles. The lighter, more recent, and more slender can be broken down by the finger or by a sponge. The firmer must be clamped, divided, and tied—either with catgut or fine silk. Extensive strands of adhesions should be clamped in sections, cut, and the bleeding points picked up individually with artery forceps, and tied in the usual way. In no cii’cumstances is the use of the actual cautery to be commended for the arrest of bleeding from divided adhesions. Oozing from a level surface can very easily be checked by continued pressure with a sponge. If the oozing be persistent, and if no individual vessels can be isolated and tied, the bleeding surface when small may often be

SUBOICAL OPERATIONS. [PAKT III. 90 down to the bone, and the digital artery is divided at its free extremity. Pie then opens the joint liy cutting tiie exposed lateral ligament, viz. that to his (the surgeon’s) right. Holding the knife vertically, with the blade directed up- wards, the operator passes it aci’oss the joint, cuts the opposite lateral ligament, and then fashions the other lateral flap (that to the surgeon’s left) by cutting from within outwards. All the tendons are divided at the joint-level, and are severed as the knife is passed transversely across the articulation. The digital vessels are cut at the free end of each flap. 3. Modified Operations for llie Forefiiijifer.—In order that the cicatrix may not be exposed to pressure when the thumb is opposed to the stump, -or when anything is being held in the hand, the following modified procedures may be carried out:— (a) By the racket incision, with the vertical cut placed upon the side of the index nearest to the middle finger, and with the incision carried a little farther on the radial than on the ulnar side of the digit. In the latter .situation it corresponds to the web. (b) By unequal lateral flaps, the external flap being the larger. (c) By the externo-palmar flap of Farabeuf. The in- cision commences at the joint-line, just to the radial side of the extensor tendon. It is carried down along, the outer side of the dorsum nearly as far as the centre of the shaft of the phalanx. It is then made to sweep across the palmar aspect of the finger to the web. From the web it passes by the shortest route to the point at which the incision com- menced (Fig. 31, a). The large flap is dissected up, carrying with it all the soft parts down to the bone. The tendons are divided, and • disarticulation is efiected in the usual way. 4. Modified Operafioiis for flic Fitflc Fiiig^cr.— These have for their object the removal of the cicatrix from an exposed position.

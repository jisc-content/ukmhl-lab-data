44 [p:\kt I. SUnaWAL OPERATIONS. Deup ill tho iiitcrviil itsell:' the large nerve to the soleus muscle (from the internal poiiliteal) will probably be met with, and must be drawn aside. It usually lies directly in the line of the opei’ation. Following the short saphenous vein, the surgeon is guided to the popliteal vessels. This part of the operation is rendered easier by flexing the knee-joint a little so as to relax the gastrocnemius. The inter- nal po2)liteal nerve is fir-st encountered, then the vein and the artery. The two flrst-named structures ai’e drawn to the inner side. The artery is cleared, and the needle is passed from the inner side (Fig. 20). 2. I.,ig:itiire of flio F|>l»er Pai’t of flic Ar- fory.—This operation is carried out in the thigh. The vessel is secured close to the inner side of the femur, and is reached be- tween the semimembra- nosus muscle and the ten- don of the adductor ma^nus. . O Operation.—The patient lies upon the back, with the hip a little flexed and the thigh fully abducted and rotated outwards. The knee-joint is bent at a right angle, and the knee and leg are thus made to lie ujjon the outer side. The surgeon stands to the outer side of the extremity in either case. The incision on the right side is made from Fig. 20.—LIGATURE or RIGHT POPLI- TEAL ARTERY (lower PART). A, Fascia; B, Gastrocnemius; a, I’opliteal artery ; h. Popliteal vein ; c.

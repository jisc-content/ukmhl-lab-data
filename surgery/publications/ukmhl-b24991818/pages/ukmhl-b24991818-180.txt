SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part m. 164 It is claimed for this amputation that the bones are covered by a flap wliich does not contain too much muscular tissue, and which possesses an artery in its entire length. It is also urged that the cicatrix is placed at the back of the stump, and is not exposed to pressure. The operation has not been received with so much favour in other countries as it apparently enjoys in England. It is an amputation of little utility and of limited application. The main bone to be covered at the end of the stump is the tibia. The anterior flap affords this bone in large part a covei’ing of skin only, and the integuments on the front of the leg are usually quite thin. The anterior flap, more- over, is of very unequal thickness, containing skin only at its inner part, and a substantial mass of muscle a.t its outer side. ' It has been pointed out that a portion of the anterior flap may be cut from the dorsum of the foot; but the tissues of that part are ill ada))ted to form the free end of a pi’incipal flap. The skin there is very thin, the sub- cutaneous tissue is scanty, and the soft pai’ts beneath are represented almost exclusively by tendons. It must be pointed out that Teale’s amputation makes a great demand upon the structures on the anterior aspect of the limb, and involves a comparatively high division of the bones. Further, the doubling of the artery upon itself round the end of the bone is a drawback. As a matter of fact, the resulting stump is so poorly nourished and so apt to ulcerate that in some cases no pressure whatever can be borne on it. Of the other operations above described, it may be said in general terms that Guyon’s amputation by oblique elliptical incision is the best when a low division of the bones is possible, and that the most suitable mode of amputating the leg in its lower third is by means of the long posterior flap (p. 160). A mode of amputation by a modified circular method is shown in Fig. 53, A.

[PABT I. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 2 ployed, it should have been kept in alcohol and not in an oily medium. The ligature to be apjdied should always be selected with great care and well tested. It should be allowed to soak for ten minutes or so in sterilised wiiter, and should then be again examined iiiid tested. l*o«!tifioii «f flio Patieiil. — The position of the patient will vary a little according to the artery to be tied. In general terms, it may be said that the surgeon should stand upon the side to be operated on, and that the incision on the right side is more conveniently made from above downwards, and on the left side from below upwards. Steps of tlic Operation.—These will be considered in the following order :— 1. The line of the artery. 2. The incision. 3. The exposure of the artery. 4. The opening of the sheath. 6. The passing of the ligature. 1. The Line of the Artery.—This line must be very accurately defined. It may dififer from what is commonly given as the anatomical line of the vessel. The posture of the limb, also, is of moment. In in- dicating the exact situation of the femoral or brachial arteries, for instance, it is essential that the limb should be placed in a certain jjosition before the line is drawn. 2. The Incision.—The incision should—when possible— be so placed upon the line of the artery as to avoid super- ficial veins. It is most desirable that there should be little bleeding during the operation, that the wound should be “ dry,” and the view of the depths not embarrassed l>y pressure forceps. The scalpel should be held in what is termed the dinner- knife position. The wound should be freely made and cleanly cut. There is a disposition to make the incision too small. A small wound carries with it special dangers

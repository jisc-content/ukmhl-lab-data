[part III. 144 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. the joint between the metatarsal bone of the great toe and the inner cuneiform, then open the tarsal joints of the three outer metatarsals, and finally disarticulate the second metatarsal. llcemorrhage.—In the dorsal flap are divided the dorsal interosseous arteries (four), opposite to the interosseous spaces, and the plantar branch of the dorsalis pedis as it dips doAvn between the bases of the first two metatarsal bones. In the plantar flap are divided the plantar digital bi’anches of the external plantar, and probably that vessel itself, near Fig. 46.—THE COUP DE JIAITKE IN LISFRANC’S AMPUTATION : SECOND STEP. {After Guerin.) the base of the second metatarsal. The terminal part of the internal plantar artery is also divided. Comment.—The dorsal flap having been made, the disarticulation may be at once proceeded with, and the operation completed by cutting the plantar flap from with- in outwards—i.e. practically by transfixion. Or, the disarticulation having been effected from the dorsum, the plantar flap may be subsequently cut in the manner already described. On the other hand, the operation may be commenced by cutting the plantar flap, and then be com- pleted by the making of the dorsal flap and by disarticulation. It is a common fault to make the dorsal flap too small.

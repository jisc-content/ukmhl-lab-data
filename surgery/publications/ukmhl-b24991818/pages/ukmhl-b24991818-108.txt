The latter structures should be carefully detached from the base of the phalanx, and are left in the stump. Fig. 31.—A, Disarticulation by special externo-palmar flap; B, Dis- ° articulation by lateral flaps; c, Amputation by unequal doreo- palmar flap ; D, Disarticulation by oblique palmar flap; E, Dis- articulation of the ring finger, with its metafcm-pal bone, by racket incision; F, Same ojieration upon the little fiugei ; G, Dubrueil’s disarticulation at the wrist. The sheath for the long flexor tendon should be closed. Two or more digital vessels will probably require ligatures. 2. By Oblique Palmar Flap.—This is Farabeufs method. It is most excellent in cases where the tissues permit of so large a flap being cut.

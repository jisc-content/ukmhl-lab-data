[part VIII. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 380 posterior method is to be advised whenever practicable. The extent of the cancer will often determine the surgeonâ€™s decision. As to whether Murphy's button or simple suturing should be employed, it may be noted that with the button tlie operation can be effected in less than half the time that suturing takes. Hence, if the patient is not in a condition to bear more than a short operation, the l)utton should certainly be u.sed. On the other hand, suturing has given the larger per- centage of recoveries ; it leaves no foreign body behind which may perhaps remain in the stomach, there is little or no tendency for the opening to contract (this has been repeatedly observed with the button), and many surgeons, after making a trial of the other method, have returned to simple suturing. The rapidity with which the latter can be performed largely depends on practice and the use of the continuous suture instead of interrupted stitches. In some of the earlier cases it is recorded that two, three, or even more hours were taken. A surgeon with experience of the operation need rarely spend an hour over the ojieration from the first step to the last.

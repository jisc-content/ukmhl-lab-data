183 CHAPTER XYII. Amputation of the Thigh. The operations so named concern amputation through the shaft of the femur, and occupy an intermediate position between disarticulation at the hip-joint on the one hand and the supra- or trans-condyloid opei’ations on the other. For the most part tliey involve a division of the bone at or lielow its centre. The following iiictlio«1s of amputating the tliigh will be described :— 1. Circular method. 2. Syme’s modification of the circular method. 3. By long anterior and sliort posterior flaps. The comparative value of these different methods, and their applicability to diflerent portions of the thigli, are considered on pages 187-88. Iiistriiiiieiits.—Large amputating-knives. (For the circular operation the blade should be about 7 to 8 inches in length, and for cutting flaps by transfixion, about 9 to 10 inches. These measurements refer to the amputation as applied to the average adult limb. In marking out skin- flaps, and in dissecting up the integuments in the circular operation, a stout knife with a liroad blade 4 inches in length and a well-rounded point should be used. No attempt should be made to complete the circular amputa- tion with one long knife. In shaping muscular flaps by cutting—as distinguished from transfixion—the stout knife with a four-inch blade should be employed. The same knife may be conveniently used to clear the bone for the saw—e.y. after transfixion flaps have been cut.) A full- sized amputation-saw. A small Butcher’s saw, to shape the

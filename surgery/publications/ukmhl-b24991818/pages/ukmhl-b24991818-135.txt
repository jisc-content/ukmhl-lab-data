A1MPUTATION8. 119 CHAP. VIII.] not generally done, this preliminary ligatni'e might form one step of Spence's operation. ITIetliods of Operating.—The following modes of disarticidating at the shoidder will be described :— 1. The racket method. Spence’s operation. 2. The external or deltoid flap. lustviimcnts.—A stout knife with a blade four to live inches in length. (If a transfixion operation be per- formed, an amputating knife with a blade equal in length to one diameter and a half of the limb will be required.) A scalpel. Ten pressure forceps. Artery and dissecting forceps. An aneurysm needle, metal retractors, scissors, etc. Position.—The patient lies close to the edge of the table, with the shoulders raised and the head turned to the opposite side. The upper limb is canned a little from the side. The surgeon should stand to the outer side of the limb in the case of both the right and the left arm. It is often, however, more convenient to stand to the inner side of the left extremity. Three assistants are required. One stands above the operator, by the patient’s head, and, leaning over the shoulder, retracts the flaps and compresses the axillary vessels before they are divided. A second assistant, standing below the surgeon, by the patient’s hip, holds the limb, and manipulates it as required. The third attends to the sponging. He is placed either facing the surgeon and upon the other side of the table, or by the shoulder. 1. Tlie Knckct Metliod.—Operation.— The following is Prof. Spence’s own account (“ Lectures on Surgery,” vol. ii., page 662) :— “(1) Supposing the right arm to be the subject of am- putation. The arm being slightly abducted, and the head of the humerus rotated outwards if possible, with a broad, strong bistoury I begin by cutting down upon the head of the humerus, immediately external to the coracoid process, and

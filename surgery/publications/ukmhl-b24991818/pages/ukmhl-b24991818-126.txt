When retraction has taken place, the skin ceases to appear to have been divided obliquely. When the integuments have been reti’acted to a point about one inch below the line of the articulation, the superficial muscles are divided by a circular sweep at that level. The skin is further retracted until the condyles are reached, and the deeply-placed muscular tissue which is still undivided is cut immediately over the joint. An assistant draws up the divided parts. The sui’geon now grasps the forearm with his left hand, and, keeping the elbow fully extended, cuts the anterior ligament and then the lateral ligaments; or he may directly enter the joint from the outer side by dividing the external ligament. Nothing now connects the limb with the trunk but the posterior ligament and the triceps. The tendon of that muscle is the last structure severed. The skin which formerly covered the olecranon now foi’ms a pouch, and an opening for a drainage-tube should be made in the centre of this depression. The wound is united so as to form a transverse cicatrix. Hceviorrhage.—The radial and ulnar arteries will be divided just below their point of origin, or the brachial will be severed close to the bifurcation. In front of the outer condyle the superior profunda, lying by the musculo-spiral nerve, may require a ligature, and the same apjjlies to the termination of the inferior profunda behind the internal condyle. 2. Elliptical Methods. — This operation may be illustrated by the Anterior Ellipse.—The figure described by the incision is rather lozenge-shaped than elliptical. The highest point of the ellipse is behind, over the prominence of the olecranon. The lowest point is on the anterior surface of the limb, over the eminence formed by

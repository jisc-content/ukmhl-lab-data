358 CHAPTER IX. Removal of the Vehmiform Appendix. The operation liere discus-sed concerns the removal of the diseased vermiform appendix during a quiescent perioil when all inflammatory symptoms have sulisided. In most cases the appendix has a distinct mesentery in which runs its artery—the termination of the ileo-colic. This mesentery (mesoappendix) when present is always derived from the posterior surface of that of the ileum. In some instances the appendix is tied down to the iliac fossa. Its average length is 3^- inche.s, hut it may be as short as half an inch or as long as six inches. The most frequent jiiositions for the appendix (which, of course, vai’y from time to time in the same individual) are (1) curvmcl or coiling upwards and inwards behind the end of the ileum (Fig. 102, a) ; (2) over the brim of the pelvis and external iliac vessels, to which it may closely adhere (Fig. 102, c); (3) downv^ards and inwards behind and just above Poupart’s ligament, and, more rarely (4), upwards along the outer margin of the ciecum and ascend- ing colon (Fig. 102, b), occasionally reaching in front of the kidney up to the gall-bladder level; and (5) upwards directly behind the ctecum, by which it is entire!}' concealed' (Fig. 102, D). The appendix is supplied with blood by the posterior ileo-crecal artery, a vessel which passes behind the end of the ileum to reach its destination. The artery to the appendix enters the mesoappendix and divides into three branches. The largest runs in the free edge of the raeso- appendix and reaches the tip of the vermiform process. The other tw'o reach the appendix at intervals of about half an inch.

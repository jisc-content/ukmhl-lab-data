The site of Hunter’s canal, l3dng between the adductor magnus and the vastus inter- ims, can now be well defined, especially if the fibres of the great adductor and the lower border of the adductor lonsjus are made prominent by fully abductin" the thi"h. When any fatty tissue wliich may obscure the part has been cleared away, the fascia which forms the I'oof of Hunter’s canal is rendered distinct. The fibres formins: this fascia are Versely. At this point there may be exposed, at the outer side of tlie wound, the nerve to the vastus internus. Tlie canal is opened in the line of the original wound, and the artery exposed (Fig. 21). The needle may be passed from either side. In front and to the outer side of the vessel will be found the internal saphenous nerve, which is easily avoided. Care must be taken that the vein be not passing tlie needle round the artery.

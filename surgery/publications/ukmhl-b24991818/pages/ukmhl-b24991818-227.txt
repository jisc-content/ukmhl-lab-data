CHAP. III.] OSTEOTOMY. 211 Foi’ a .short distance above the condyles tlie femur has a much thicker outer than inner border; in many instances the outer is twice as thick as the inner. If the form of the bone be not borne in mind, the sur- geon may think that he has divided it sufficiently, and yet he may find that it will not yield, owing, in most cases, to the posterior and outer part re- maining intact. In young subjects up to fifteen or sixteen, the division of the internal two-thirds of the bone will usually suffice, the remainder being broken ; but in adults, espe- cially when the bone is hard and brittle, the section should be more complete, and as little fracturing should be attempted as is pos- sible. In children one osteotome will suffice for the division of the bone. If care be not exercised, it is possible for the femur to be split longitudinally. The incision employed is above the level of the articular liga- ments. The cut in the soft ]>arts may be made transversely, and be so placed as to correspond to the intended bone incision. By this means the osteotome is more readily introduced and more easily re-inserted should it be accidentally removed during the operation. The transverse incision spares the soft parts from a certain amount of bruising And disturb- ance, but it does not favour so complete a subcutaneous method. Although the synovial pouch of the knee-joint reaches as high as the level of the bone incision, it is not in the way of the actual wound itself, since it tapers to the middle line Fig. 73. — it.vcEWEN’s OPERATION FOR GENU VALGUM.

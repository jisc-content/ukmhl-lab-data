[part III SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 160 ^ The foot should now be extended, and the anterior in- cision carried well down to the bone, care being taken to avoid opening the ankle-joint. The soft parts on the front of the leg are dissected up to the level named. Retractors having been adjusted, the surgeon divides the bones horizontally well above the bases of the malleoli (Fig. 51, a). The posterior tibial nerve should be dissected out and removed. Ilmmorrhage.—The anterior tibial artery is divided near the anterior border of the tibia. The posterior tibial v^essel is cut at the inner side of the heel flap, while the termination of the peroneal is severed at the outer side. In the soft parts in front of the outer malleolus the anterior peroneal is divided. 2. Amputation by a I..ai*ge Posterior Flap.— Two flaps are made, the pos- terior being the larger. The length of the posterior flap, when completed, is equal to that of half the circumference of the limb at the saw-line. This is after retraction has been allowed for. As the flap may be con- .sidei’ed to lose about one-third of its length by retraction, the posterior flap, as oi’iginally marked out on the skin, will to this extent exceed in length the measurement given. The anterior flap is about one-fourth of the posterior. The flaps may be conveniently fashioned as shown in Fig. 54, A. The posterior flap reaches, so far as the skin limit is concerned, to about the insertion of the tendo Achillis. The internal vertical incision which limits it descends in Fig. 51.—A, Guyon’s supra- malleolar ainputatioiv: a, saw-line for that ojieration; n, Duval’s suijratnalleolar amputation : h, saw-line for that oj^eration.

157 AMPUTATIONS. CHAP, xm.] The wliole of the upper surface of the os calcis is exposed. The saw is applied to this surface, one finger’s- breadth behind the astragalus, and is made to cut the bone obliquely, following the lines of the now distorted heel incision. In sawing the bone, the soft parts must be carefully retracted,’ and, in the position in which the foot is held, the saw runs nearly vertically. The greatest care must be taken not to damage the arteries in the inner pai-t of the heel flap. The soft parts are now dissected from the lower ends of the tibia and flbula. The saw is applied to the anterior aspect of these bones, close to the articular surface of the tibia, and is made to cut so obliquely upwards that the saw emerges on the posterior aspect of the tibia, a finger’s- breadth above the articular surface (Fig. 50, c). Any unduly long tendons are divided. The wound is sutured as in Syme’s operation, the cut surfaces of bone being thus brought into close contact. Care must be taken in the after-treatment that the heel fragment is not drawn up by the tendo Achillis. The vessels divided are the same as in the preceding operation. Comment.—Some surgeons make much larger heel flaps, carrying the incision forwards and downwards, so as to cross the calcaneo-cuboid joint, instead of directing it nearly vertically downwards from the malleoli.

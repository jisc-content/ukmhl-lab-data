Opening of tlic Stoiiiacli.—It is usually well to open the stomach at once in order to feed the patient. Should, however, the condition of the patient be sulli- ciently good to war- rant three or four days’ delay, the sur- geon may decide to defer the opening for this time. There can be no doubt that this delay, made from a somewhat needless dread of causing peritonitis, has frequently caused death from exhaustion. Imme- diate opening ac- cording to the plan described is per- fectly safe, and is to be advised. The essential thing is to make the inci- sion through the stomach wall small and valvular. A great variety of methods have been devised with this object, but the follow- ing will be found as good as any. {See Fig.s. 104 and 105.) A continuous silk suture is make to circumscribe a small circular area at the apex of the pouch, passing through the outer coats; before it is tied the stomach wall is incised with a tenotome within this area so as just to admit a No. 10 Fig. 105. —GASTROSTOMY. The rubber tube (t) is introduced and fi.Ked by tightening the suture shown in the pre- vious figure. The pouch is then invaginated and a second continuous suture (3 and 3) maintains this condition. Note.—The sutures 1 and 1, in both figures, should be more tightly tied.

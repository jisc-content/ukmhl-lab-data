[part XI. 452 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. the stump of the urethra drawn through this opening; the end of the urethra is notclied on both sides so that it can be everted and sutured all round to the margin of the opening in the flap. The edges of the latter and of the skin below are then sutured. Either fine silk or catgut may be used—the latter has the advantage of not requiring subsequent removal. It is difficult to keep any dressing applied, and none is really required. Some boracic and iodoform powder may be dusted on. It is well to leave the ends of two of the sutures which secure the new meatus long, as they facilitate the passage of a catheter during the next day or two. However, as a rule, the patient will be able to pass his ui-ine without an instrument. It will be seen that by this method no raw surface is left, requiring slow cicatrisation with its attendant risk of stricture. Healing is therefore rapid, and the patient need not be kept in bed for more than a week or so. One point in the operation is of special impoi'tance : to take plenty of time in securing all bleeding vessels before the flap is sewn down. The use of the tourniquet is essential. If any lymphatic glands in either gi’oin are enlai’ged, they should be excised at the same time as the amputation of the penis. This is done through an oblique incision on one or both sides, the cut runnirig parallel to Poupart’s ligament.

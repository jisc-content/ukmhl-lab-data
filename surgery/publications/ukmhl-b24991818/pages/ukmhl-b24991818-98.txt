SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 82 [part m. have sufficiently and evenly retracted, the muscular part of the flap is cut with great care. The knife is passed obliquely through the muscle to the bone, and the soft parts forming the apex of the flap having been completely divided, the rest of the deeper tissues of the flap are very carefully dissected up ox’ peeled off from the bone. This method is well illustrated by the amputation of the leg at the place of election by a siixgle external flap (p. 168). The main points to be considered iix the selection of a method are the following:— 1. The least sacrifice of the healthy tissues of the limb. 2. The providing of a good and penuanent covering for the bone. 3. The obtainiixg of as small a wound ai’ea as is con- sistent with the proper performance of the amputation. 4. The securing of a good blood supply for the flaps or tissues which will form the stump. 5. The production of a well-adjusted cicatrix, and one so placed as to be I’eixioved from pressure when the stump has healed. 6. The ease with which the bone can be exposed at the saw-line, and the general simplicity of the method. 7. The cuttiixg of the main vessels transversely. 8. The rapidity with which the amputation can be per- formed.

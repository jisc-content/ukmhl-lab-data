CHAP. VII.] AMPUTATIONS. 115 {i.e. upon the outer surface of the right arm and the inner surface of the left). The assistant holding the forearm so rotates the limb as to make the tissues meet the knife. The further steps of the operation have been indicated on page 78. Ihemorrhage.—The vessels are divided upon the face of the stump—the brachial to the inner side with the median nerve; the superior profunda upon the postero-external aspect of the bone with the musculo-spiral nerve ; the in- fei’ior profunda to the inner side of the brachial with the ulnar nerve. In addition to these three vessels, several muscular branches will need to be secured. 2. By Autero-posferior Flaps {pnicldle of the limb). — The base of each flap slioidd be equal to one-half the cir- cumference of the limb. The length of the anterior flap should equal that of the diameter of the limb. The posterior flap should be half the length of the anterior. Both are U-shaped, and the incisions defining thefn are commenced just below the future saw-line (Fig. 38 b). These incisions are so disposed that the brachial artery comes in the posterior flap, and great care must be taken that the division between the flaps is not just over the vessel, which would in such case probably be split in cutting the flaps by transfixion. An assistant, grasping the limb by the elbow and wrist, flexes the forearm and rotates the extremity as required. In marking out the anterior flap the arm is so rotated that the flexed forearm is carried towards the sui'geon. The incision is commenced on the side of the arm farthest from the operator {i.e. on the ulnar side of the right arm and the radial side of the left). The knife is carried from above downwards. As it sweeps across the front of the limb to form the tip or bend of the U, the arm is held straight, and as the blade is carried upwards to complete the other limb of the U, the arm is so rotated that the forearm is carried away from the surgeon.

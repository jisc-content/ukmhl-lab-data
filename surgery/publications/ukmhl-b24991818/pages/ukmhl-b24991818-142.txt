The exposed subclavius niu.scle is now isolated, is divided close to the site of the inner section of the bone, and is dissected up so as to expose the great vessels, and turned outwards. Fasciie of varying thickness will have to be divided before the vessels are reached. A double ligature is jiassed round both the artery and the vein, and between the ligatures each vessel is divided.

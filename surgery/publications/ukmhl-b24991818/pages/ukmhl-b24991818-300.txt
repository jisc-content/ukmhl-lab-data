[part VII. 284 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. The surgeon, still fixing the trachea and soft parts with the left hand, cuts deliberately in the middle line through the subcutaneous fat and the anterior layer of the cervical fascia. The sterno-hyoid and the sterno-thyroid muscles are reached, and the interval between them is opened up. All this is done by successive, clean cuts. The surgeon now separates the muscles, using the dissecting for- ceps and the handle of the scalpel for the purpose. Keeping still to the middle line, and once more steadying the trachea, he divides cleanly, and by cautious cuts, the fascia covering that tube. At this stage veins will probably be en- countered, and may be displaced to one or other side by the handle of the scalpel. The isthmus of the thyroid will be seen, and is by a like means displaced down- wards. If necessary, it may be drawn and held downwards by a small blunt hook. 87.—opF,n.\Tioxs AXn THACHKA. ox THE LARYX.X (Tillmann.)

The surgeon now feels for the tracheal rings with his left forefinger. He should be satisfied that the tube is veil bared, and lie should be able to see the white rings themselves. Tins is absolutely essential before the trachea is incised.

This may be effected with the scalpel at one sweep. The margins of the ring are now freshened, as in plastic operations involving the skin, and the opening in tlie aponeurotic part of the abdontinal parieties is closed by sutures. These buried sutures should be of silk or of strong kangaroo tendon. They may be introduced on a curved needle in a needle holder. Before they are inserted, tlj.e sponge should be removed and be replaced by the end of an ivory spatula, which will serve to protect the intestines from injury. As many sutures as possible should be introduced befoi’e any are tied. They must be closely placed—four to six to the inch—and must include the whole thickness of the aponeurosis and the peritoneum. The ojoeration is concluded by suturing the .skin and subcutaneous tissues with silkworm-gut. Tlie wound is entirely closed, and no drainage tube is required. The dressing of the wound and its subsequent treatment are conducted upon the lines observed in other abdominal operations.

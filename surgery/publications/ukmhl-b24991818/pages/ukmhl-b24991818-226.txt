210 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part IV. table. Both hip and knee are flexed ; the thigh is abducted and rests upon its outer side. The knee is well fixed upon the sand-pillow. The surgeon places himself upon the outer side of the limb. A sharp-pointed scalpel is introduced on the inside of the thigh, at a point where the two following lines meet— one drawn transversely, a finger’s-breadth above the superior tip of the external condyle, and a longitudinal one drawn half an inch in front of the adductor magnus tendon. The scalpel here penetrates at once to the bone, and a longi- tudinal incision (Fig. 73, a) is made, sufficient to admit the lai’gest osteotome. Before withdrawing the scalpel, the osteotome is slipped by its side until it reaches the bone. The scalpel is withdrawn, and the osteotome, which was introduced longitudinally, is now turned ti-ansversely in the direction required for the osseous incision (Fig. 73, b). The osteotome is then driven through the bone in various pre-arranged directions until the division is nearly complete. After a certain amount of the bone has been divided, a finer instrument may replace the one first employed. It is desirable to complete all the work intended by any one osteotome before removing it from the wound. When the operator thinks that the bone has been sufficiently divided, the osteotome is laid aside and a sterilised sponge is placed over the wound. While the surgeon holds the sponge, he at the same time employs that hand as a fulcrum; with the other he grasps the limb lower down, using it as a lever, and jerks if the bone be hard, or bends slowly if the bone be soft, in an inward direction, when the bone will snap or bend as the case may be. Neither sutures nor drainage-tubes are required. Comment.—The highest part of the articular surface of the femur is a good guide to the level of the lowest part of the incision. Great care must be taken that the line of the bone incision is appreciated and accurately followed.

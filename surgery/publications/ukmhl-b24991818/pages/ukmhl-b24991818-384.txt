SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 368 [part VIII. is drawn forwards and held in position while the sutures are being introduced. 3. Fixing- ot the Stoiuaeli.—This is best effected by means of fine silkworm-gut or silk sutures. The needles should be of moderate size (aljout No. 5), and fully curved. The stomach is drawn well forward into tbe wound, and eacli needle is made to take a good hold of the gastric wall. It should penetrate all the coats except the mucous. The needle is then carried through the perito- neum, and ultimately through the muscular layers of the parietes and the skin. In order to make the inclusion of the peritoneum simple and certain, it is as well to fix it on either side with pressure forceps, by means of which the membrane can be brought well into view while the needles are being passed. The sutures should be so inserted as, to circumscribe an area on the stomach about equal to a shilling-piece. From six to ten sutures will suffice. It is as well to introduce several of the main sutures before any are tied. The sutures should take up enough of the stomach Avail to secure a good hold. The mucous coat must not be punctured, and each stitch must be very securely tied. There should be no Fig. 104.—GASTROSTO.MY. A pouch of stomach (s) is drawn out and fi.xed by sutures, two of Avhich (1 and 1) are shown passing through the abdominal wall (\\). These, although shown loose, are securely knotted. A continuous suture (2 and 2) is passed through the outer coats of the .stomach-ijouch, Avhich is then incised at s.

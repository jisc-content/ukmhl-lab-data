205 OSTEOTOMY. CHAP. I.] The wedge, moreover, need not extend through the entire tliickness of the bone. It may involve possibly three-fourths of the diameter of the bone, the remaining fourth being bent or broken. In pei’forming this operation a chisel will be found to be more convenient than a saw. In some forms of bony ankylosis of joints, however, the saw may prove to be the more suitable instrument, or both saw and chisel may be used together. The incision in the soft parts must of necessity be com- paratively large—as large at least as the base of the intended wedge. It need be no larger, since the skin can be displaced in one or other direction according to the position of the chisel. As soon as the bone is exposed, the periosteum must be divided and carefully separated with the elevator. In dividing the bone the chisel should be employed and not the osteotome. The instrument must be so held that the straight edge is towards the bone to the left, and the bevelled edge towards the portion to be removed. If a large wedge has to be removed, it should be dealt with in sections. A small wedge-shaped piece should first be taken out, and then thin slices of bone should be shaved from each side of the exposed bone until a cunei- form cavity of the desired size and shape has been jiroduced. If an attempt be made to remove a large wedge at once, it will be found that the chisel is apt to go awry, to incline towards the straight edge, and in consequence an uncertain division of the bony tissue is made. It is not well to attempt to prise out the wedge of bone with the chisel. The bone so treated is apt to split, or the chisel may be broken. The wedge can be removed better with forceps aided by an elevator. After the bone has been dealt with, the periosteal flaps may be brought together by a few fine catgut sutui-es. The skin wound should not be too completely closed, but room shall be left for drainage.

109 CHAPTER VI. Disarticulation at the Elbow-Joint. Iiisti'iiiiioiits.—An amputating-knife some six to seven inches in length for transfixion operation. A stout knife with a cutting edge of four to five inches, when flaps are cut from without inwards, and for disarticulating. A scalpel; retractors; pressure, artery, and dissecting forceps; scissors, needles, etc. Position.—The arm is abducted to a right angle. The surgeon—except in an instance below specified—stands to the right of the limb in all cases—i.e. to the outer side of the right elbow and the inner side of the left.

The following methods will be described ;— 1. The circular. 2. The elliptical. 3. The large anterior flap. 1. Circular Method.—In order to prepare for the unequal retraction of the skin, the incision must be a little oblique. Over the supinator longus it .should be about three inches below the joint-line, and over the posterior border of the ulna one inch and a half below that level. Grasping the arm with his left hand, while an assistant holds the forearm, the surgeon makes the circular incision with one sweep.

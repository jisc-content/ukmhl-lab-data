224 [part IV, SURGICAL OPERATIONS. gouge may be used with the greatest freedom. The meta- carpal bones are next dealt with on the same princiide, each being closely investigated—the second and third being most readily reached from the radial, the fourth and fifth from the ulnar side. If they seem sound, the articular surfaces only are clipped off, the lateral facets being removed by longitudinal application of the pliers. “ The trapezium is next seized with forceps and dissected out, without cutting the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, which is firmly bound down in the groove on the palmar aspect, the knife Ijeing also kept close to the bone to avoid the radial. The thumb being then pushed up by an assist- ant, the articular end of the metacarpal bone is removed, 'riiough this articulates by a separate joint, it may be effected, and the symmetry of the hand is promoted by reducing it to the same level as the other metacarpals. “ Lastly, the articular surface of the pisiform is clipped oft', the rest being left, if sound, as it gives insertion to the flexor carpi ulnaris and attachment to the anterior annular ligament.” Comment.—The ulnar incision described above is not absolutely necessary, and the amount of bone removed must entirely depend upon the extent of disease. Thus it may be possible to spare most of the second row of carpal bones with the pisiform and the bases of the metatarsus. The less bone that is removed, so long as all the disease is eradicated, the better will be the functional result.

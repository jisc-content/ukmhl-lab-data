CHAP, vni.] EXCISION OF JOINTS. 231 and a little outwards to follow the inclination of the anterior margin of the deltoid muscle (Fig. 78, a). The knife is carried straight down to the joint, the coraco-acromial arch is exposed, and the capsule of the joint laid bare in the line of the incision. The biceps tendon is next sought for, and the capsular ligament is opened vertically just to the outer side of the tendon. It is most con- veniently incised from below upwards. (6) Separation of the Outer Margin of the Wound.—The operator now proceeds to clear the tissues from the bone upon the outer side of the wound. In the case of the right limb this will be the left margin of the wound, and in the case of the left limb the right margin. The parts are well retracted with the left thumb, aided when re- quired by retractors. The surgeon uses a blunt-pointed knife, and separates the soft parts from the upper end of the humerus by cutting on to the bone. The instrument should be kept as close to the bone as possible. As the separation proceeds, the assistant rotates the humerus inwards, while at the same time he depresses the elbow and forces the head of the bone forwards. The surgeon clears the capsule from the outer part of the bone, and on reaching the external tuberosity severs the insertions of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and small teres muscles.

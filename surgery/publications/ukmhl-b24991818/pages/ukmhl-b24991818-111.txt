CHAP. III.] 95 AMPUTATIONS. incision follows the median doi'.sal line of the metacarpal, while the oval cut traverses the web and follows the transverse digito-palrnar crease. The general features of the operation are the same as in the complete disarticulations {vide infra). The dorsal incision should be commenced a little way above the point at which it is intended to divide the. bone. The bone should be severed with a saw whenever possible, the soft parts being protected by a director during the passage of the instrument. The shaft is apt to be much crushed if bone forceps are employed. The second and fifth metacarpals should be divided obliquely, so that the end of the bone may not project unduly upon the margin of the hand. 2. Disarticulation ol a Finger witli tlie corresponcling Metacarpal Bone.—The racket in- cision is conveniently employed. The operation may be illustrated upon the ring finger (Fig. 31, e). The joint line having been made out, the queue of the racket is commenced just above the articulation, and is carried down along tlie dorsum of the metacarpal until the base of the knuckle is reached. The incision here divides, and the oval wound, following the clefts between the fingei’s, crosses the web and terminates transversely at the digito-palrnar crease in the skin. The incision involves at first the skin only, the surgeon holding the finger and manipulating it as required with his left hand. An assistant now takes charge of the finger while the surgeon deepens the dorsal incision and divides the extensor tendons just beyond the base of the bone. The sides of the shaft of the metacarpal are now bared from one end to the other, the knife being kept very close to the bone. During this step the surgeon uses his left finger to assist in the sepai’ation of the interossei from the shaft, the assistant rotating the digit as required. The knife is carried back between the bases of the meta- carpal bones (on either side of the bone to be removed), so

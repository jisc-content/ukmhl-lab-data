70 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [pakt ri. to be extended. A vertical incision, four inches in length, is then made in the course of the nerve. The incision should commence over the gluteal fold, and should be exactly opposite to the middle of the interval between the tuber ischii and the great trochanter. If the wound be made neai-er to the tuber there is an increased difficulty in displacing the hamstring muscles. The centre of the incision will about correspond to the free lower margin of the gluteus maximus. The skin and fascia having been divided, the small sciatic nerve and a few cutaneous arteries will be en- countered. The quantity of the subcutaneous fat may be considerable. The lower border of the gluteus maximus should be clearly exposed as it runs obliquely downwards and out- waiâ€™ds. The edge of this muscle must be drawn upwards by means of a strong and broad retractor. The finger introduced into the wound will now en- counter the hamstring muscles a little beloNv their origin from the tuber ischii. These muscles' should all be drawn inwards, their fibres having been first relaxed by bending the knee. They are retained in position by another strong and broad retractor. The nerve should now be readily discovered and brought into view.

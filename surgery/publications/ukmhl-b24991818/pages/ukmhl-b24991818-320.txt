304 CHAPTER IV. Q^sopiiagotomy. The operation of oesopliagofcomy is carried out, as a rule, for the removal of foreign bodies which have become im- pacted in the tube. In one or two instances attemj^ts have been made to dilate a simple stricture of the gullet through an incision in the neck. Iii^li'iiiiiciits required. — Gag; tongue forceps; oesophageal bougie and forceps; scalpels; blunt-pointed bistoury; retractors; sharp hook; arteiy and pressure forceps; dissecting forceps ; long bladed, toothed dissecting forcejjs; scissors; needles; needle-holder; periosteal ele-' Amtor to assist in removing the foreign body. I'lic Opei-afioii.—The general features of the opera- tion are similar to those Avhich attend a ligature of the common carotid. The gullet is approached from the left side of the neck, inasmuch as the tube inclines to that side. Should the foreign body be felt more distinctly upon the right side, then the incision may be made in that quarter. The shoulders are Avell raised, the head is a little ex- tended and is turned to the right or opposite side. Every attempt should have been made to define the exact position of the foreign body before the incision is begun. A skiagram of the neck showing the foreign body is indispensable. The situation of the cut will be influenced by the locality of the foreign body. Very usually it is the commencement of the oesophagus that is exposed. The skin incision will commence opposite to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and will be continued doAvn- Avards along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle for about three inches.

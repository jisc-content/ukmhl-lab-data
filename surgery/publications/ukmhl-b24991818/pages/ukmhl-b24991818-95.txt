79 CHAP. I. AMPUTATIONS. of little more than curved incisions made across opposite surfaces of the limb, each being equal to one-half of the circumference of the limb. The skin beyond the bases of the little flaps is then retracted as a whole, just as in the usual circular amputa- tion. When the retraction has been carried to a sufficient extent, the muscles are divided by circular incisions in the usual way. This method is illustrated by an amputation of the thigh (page 184). 3. The Elliptical Method.—This method occupies an intermediate position between the circular operation and the amputation by a single flap. The incision in the skin is elliptical or lozenge-shaped {le mode loscmgique). The position and inclination of the ellij)se vary according to the site of the amputation, and have to be carefully estimated. The skin and subcutaneous tissues are then retracted, by gliding, as in one amputation at the wrist, or by the. turning up of a cuff, as in the dis- articulation at the elbow by a posterior ellipse, or by the separation of a definite flap, as in Guyon’s supramalleolar amputation. The muscles are usually divided as in the circular operation. They may be, however, cut in part by transfixion, as in the disarticulation at the elbow-joint by an anterior ellipse. The elliptical method is well adapted for amputations through certain joints. 4. The Oval Racket Method.—The skin incision takes the form of an oval with one end pointed, or of an isosceles triangle roupded at its base. The edges of the resulting wound are united in its long axis. The soft parts beneath the skin are divided down to the bone by cutting from without inwards. This operation is illustrated on a small scale by some amputations at the joints of the fingers and toes. To obtain a better exposure of a joint without loss of substance, and to afford a better covering for the bone in the upper part of the wound, Malgaigne extended a longitudinal cut from the apex of the oval, producing thus

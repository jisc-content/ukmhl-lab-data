CHAPTER X. Excision of the Ankle-joint, etc. Operation.—The various methods in vogue for per- forming this operation are for the most part modifications of the original procedure of Moreau. Indeed, no very conspicuous deviations from the initial operation have been proposed or carried out. Of the modern forms of Moreau’s operation, that by Langenbeck would appear to be one of the best. It may be carried out as follows, if the sub- periosteal method be attempted : The patient lies upon the back, with the foot and leg supported upon a firm .sand pillow. Two vertical lateral incisions are made. The leg and foot should be rendered bloodless by the application of Esmarch’s tourniquet, other- wise it will be impossible to dissect out thoroughly all the diseased tissues in a case of tuberculous ankle. 1. The Outer Incision.—The foot being turned over upon its inner side, a vertical incision some thi’ee inches in length is made along the anterior part of the fibula to a point a little below the tip of the malleolus. Thence it is made to curve around the malleolus, and ascend for about one inch along its posterior border (Fig. 79, n). 2. The Removal of the External Malleolus.—The fibula is exposed, and its periosteum divided in the long axis of the bone. The membrane is then separated from the bone by the rugine in an anterior and a posterior direction. The ligaments attached to the malleolus are separated as encountered. The external lateral ligament is divided vertically, so that its anterior segment will go with the anterior layer of separated periosteum, and its hinder segment with the posterior layer. With the curved rugine the greater part of the circum-

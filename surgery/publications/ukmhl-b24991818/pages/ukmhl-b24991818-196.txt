SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part hi. 180 The anterior cut is made first. The points of starting and ending may be marked by the thumb and forefinger. The knee-joint is a little flexed as this incision is being made. In the right limb it is commenced on the inner side, and in the left extremity on the outer side. The assistant rotates the limb as the knife passes across it. The posterior incision is made by one single transverse sweep. Both incisions should involve at first only the skin and the subcutaneous tissue. (2) The limb being extended, the anterior flap is dis- sected up, containing all the soft parts down to the patella and the capsule of the joint. The posterior “Hap” may be a little freed and allowed to glide up, in order to aid the separation of the anterior flap. (3) The knee being flexed, the joint is opened by cut- ting through the quadriceps tendon just above the patella. That bone is seized by the surgeon, and the anterior capsule divided on either side. The crucial and lateral ligaments are cut. With one vigorous sweep of the knife the tissues at the posterior aspect of the limb are then divided down to the bone at the level of the hinder skin incision. A few touches with the knife serve to entirely separate the leg. (4) The soft parts are now retracted so as to clear the bone for the passage of the saw. In dividing the femur the saw must be kept parallel to the articular suilace and perpendicular to the shaft. In young subjects regard must be had to the epiphyseal line. Haemorrhage.—The popliteal artery is divided close to the bone at its inner aspect. Some muscular branches may require ligature. On the cut surface of the posterior flap will be found the two superior articular branches froili the popliteal (divided close to the femur) and the anastomotica magna (on the inner side). Branches of the latter vessel and of the descending portion of the external circumflex may require to be secured in the margins of the anterior flap.

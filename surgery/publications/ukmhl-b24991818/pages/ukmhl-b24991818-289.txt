273 HARE-LIF. CHAP. I.] Some of these fine stitches may be required along the main wound, and one will usually be needed for the margin of the nostril. So-called hai’e-lip pins are never retjuired, nor is strap ping ever needed to support the wound. ■ Tlie wound having been well dried witli small piepes of line sponge, the surface is dusted with boracic acid or iodoform, and is covered with a strip of soft gauze. The gauze may consist of several layers, and the component strip must be cut to exactly fit the part, and should not extend on to the cheek. A vei’y slender piece of strapping will keep the gauze in place. Instead of j)lain gauze, gauze and collodion, or a solution of celloidin (5 parts) in ethylic alcohol and ether ’ . (of each 10 parts), may be used. The " latter dressing fits accurately, and is DOUBLE IIA RE-LIP. The operation required in cases pjg. 8.5.—operatiox koh of double hare-lip is of the same douhle iiahe-lip. character as that already described. In many instances the defect is more pasily remedied when it is double than when merely a single gap exists. In the most favourable forms of double hare-lip the sides of the cleft are .symmetrical, and are, moreover, more nearlj?^ parallel than is the case in single hare-lip. A malplaced pre-maxillary bone is the most troulile- some complication met with in dealing with this deformity. The skin over the pre-maxillary bone is freed from its deep attachments behind, and its edges are pared so that it receives a U- or V-shaped outline. The margins of the lip on each side are then pared in the manner already described (page 271). The portions of the lip may or may not need to be freed from their attachments (Fig. 85). The raw edges are finally united with silkworm-gut sutures. Owing to the small .size and the shape of the central piece, the lesulting wound is more or less Y-shaped.

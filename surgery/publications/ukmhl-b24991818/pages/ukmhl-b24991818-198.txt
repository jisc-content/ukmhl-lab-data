182 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [PAET III. butcher’s or other narrow-bladed saw removes the articular cartilage from this bone. This is the only difficult step of the operation. A long knife is then passed through immediately behind the femur from side to side, and is made to cut downwards and backwards at an angle of 60 degree to the axis of the limb. The femur is sawn across a finger’s breadth above the top of the condyles. The popliteal artery and vein are secured with a fev.' other vessels in the anterior flap. The surfaces of the patella and femur will be found to come into apposition without tension, and to correspond closely in size. Some operators fix the two bones with wire or sutures by drilling holes on either side, but this fixation is unnecessary. The resulting stump is an excellent one, on which the patient can well bear a good deal of his weight.

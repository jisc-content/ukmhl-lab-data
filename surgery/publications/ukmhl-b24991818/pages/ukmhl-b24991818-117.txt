CHAP. IV.] AMPUTATIONS. 10] The l)l{ule of the knife should be four inches in length. The highest point of the ellipse is on the dorsum, a little to the inner side of the middle line, and half an inch below the line of the wrist-joint. The lowest point is on the palm, in a line with the middle finger, and about two inches below the level of the highest point. In forming the ellipse between these two points the in- cision on the ulnar side should pass between the pisiform bone and the base of the fifth meta- carpal, while on the radial side it should cross the carpo- metacarpal joint of the thumb (Fig. 33). The surgeon, holding the subject’s hand in the supine position, mai’ks out the palmar part of the ellipse, com- mencing the incision on the left side (the surgeon’s left) of the hand. The operator now pronates the hand and marks out the dorsal segment of the ellipse, the assistant at the same time drawing up the integuments at the back of the hand. The first incision concei’ns the skin and the subcu- taneous tissues only.

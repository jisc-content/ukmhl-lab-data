416 CHAPTER II. Opekations for the Radical Cure of Hernia. liisti’uinciits required.—Blunt hooks; scissors; scalpels; pressure forceps; dissecting^ and fine pointed forceps ; curved and straight needles ; needle-holders, etc. Special mounted needles (of the pattern designed by Sir W. INIacewen and others) are sometimes used, hut they are usually made too clumsy and blunt at the points. A simple long needle mounted on a holder and sharp-pointed is use- ful. It should be slightly curved on the flat. For intro- ducing the deep stitches, ordinary fully-curved needles will be found more convenient than any special form. It is most important that all sutures, whether they are to be buried or not, should have been rendered perfectly aseptic. For the deep sutures there is nothing to equal kangaroo tendon which has been preserved in 1 and 20 alcoholic solution of carbolic acid, and which before the operation is placed in cold sterile water to remove the antiseptic agent. Tlic Incision, etc.—The whole of the pubic region having been shaved and carefully disinfected beforehand, the skin over the inguinal canal is finally cleansed with an alcoholic solution of carbolic acid or biniodide of mercury, and then dried with sterilised pads. The penis and scrotum, thighs, and upper part of abdomen are protected with dry sterilised towels. Only the region just above Poupart’s ligament requires to be exposed, as the incision is placed here whether the hernia may have descended to the bottom of the scrotum or not. The opex’ator feels for the pubic spine, identifies the external ring and Poupart’s ligament, and then jiroceeds to make a linear incision which commences over the ring and runs for three or four inches parallel to and above the ligament (Fig. 112).

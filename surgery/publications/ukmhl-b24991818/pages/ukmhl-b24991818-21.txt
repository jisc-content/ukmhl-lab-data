CHAP. I.] 5 LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. The veufe comites lie close to the artery, one upon each side of it. They are apt to communicate with one another fi-eely across the vessel by means of many ti’ansverse branches. 4. The Opening of the Sheath.—^The artery is now reached. It remains to open the sheath, and to clear a part of the vessel for the passage of the aneurysm needle. The sheath must be opened with the scalpel with- infinite care and the most delicate precision. The knife must have a perfect cutting edge. A good light is essential, and a pair of trustworthy forcejjs by means of which it is possible to ]hck up a fine fold of tissue and hold it firmly. The sheath is picked up over the centre, or median part, of the artery, in the form of a fold which is transverse Co the long axis of the vessel. It must be picked up cleanly and entirely. The transverse fold of tlie s||}eath is then incised. The cut should be clean, should be made in the long axis of the artery, and over the centre of the vessel. In length it should be from 5 to 10 mm. When the sheath has been well divided, the seroins- like space between it and the artery becomes at once evident. The blade of the scalpel should be inclined obliquely— i.e. with the flat of the knife towards the artery. The fold of the sheath must be held well up during the making of the incision. When once a good hold of the sheath has been obtained by the forceps the instrument must not be shifted. In this part of the opei-ation a director is not only useless but dangerous. 5. The Passing of the Ligature.—The original hold of the forceps upon the sheath should not be relaxed. The surgeon clears a way for the aneurysm needle with the vivisector’s tool. He then takes the aneurysm needle in his right hand, and introduces its unthreaded point between the artery and the sheath for the purpose of clearing the former. The needle should be held with its concavity towards the vessel, and it should be gently insinuated about half-way

124 CHAPTER IX. Amputation of the Upper Limb together with the Scapula. . This amputation involves the removal of the upper limb, together with the scapula and the outer two-thirds of the clavicle. No disarticulation is attempted at the shoulder- joint. . The best method is that of Paul Berger, by two Haps— an antero-inferior or pectoro-axillary flap, and a posterior- superior or cervico-scapular flap. Insti'Uiiiciits.—A strong, stout amputating-knife, with a blade from five to six inches in length ; a stout scalpel; a periosteal elevator or rugine, curved on the flat; metal retractors, spatuhe, and blunt hooks; a keyhole-saw or a flne chain-saw; bone forceps, lion forceps, aneurysm needle, pressure forceps, artery and dissecting forceps, scissors, etc. Position.—The position of the surgeon varies with each step of the operation, and is described below. Three assistants should be at his service. Steps of the Operation.—^The amputation may be divided into four stages. ls<. The clavicle is exposed, and is divided at the junc- tion of the middle with the inner third. The middle third of the bone is excised. The subclavian vessels are exposed, and are secured by double ligatures and divided. 2mZ.

03 OHAr. I.] OPERATIONS UPON NER VES. 2 ;uul 3. IV'(>iir4»loiiiy —Tliose operations are of necessity limited to smaller nerves, and in nearly every instance to such nerves as are purely sensory. The nerve is exposed at some place of election,” and is dealt with by one or other ot the methods named. By means of special forceps (those devised by Professor Thiersch, which resemble long narrow Wells’s forceps) several inches of nerve can be dragged out at the time of the neurectomy. The majority of these operations are not of great gravity. 4. rVciii‘oi‘i’a|>liy.—This operation concerns the union of nerve trunks which have been severed by accident. The term “ immediate suture ” is applied to cases in which the divided ends of tlie nerve are united within a short time of the accident; the term “secondary suture'” to instances in which a period of time varying from weeks to months has elapsed between the receipt of the injury and the operation. It is needless to say that the former measure is the simpler and by far the more successful. In the immediate suture, the wound is perfectly cleaned, the cut ends of the nerve are brought together and united by sutures. Any bruised or jagged part of the exposed nerve is cut away. The general features of the operation are identical with those now to be described. In the secondary suture the steps of the 23rocedure are as follow : The nerve is exposed. The incision is made over the course of the nerve and parallel to it. The upper end of the nerve is more easily found than the lower. It is usually enlarged, bulbous, and sensitive. The lower end, on the other hand, is usually atrophied and filiform, and is apt to be lost in cicatricial tissue, and to be free from notable sensation. It may be necessary to expose the trunk of the nerve lower down, and then to follow the cord upwards, in order to find the “ lower end ” with greater certainty.

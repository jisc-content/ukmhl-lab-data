SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 248 [PAKT IV. incision—in which there is no drainasre-tube in most cases O —and the whole joint is covered with aseptic gauze so adjusted that evenly-graduated pressure is brought to bear upon every aspect of the field of operation, while the limb is held well abducted. If the wool be now firmly com- pressed with a spica bandage, the walls of the whole clean- scraped cavity are brought into contact, and the remainder of the neck of the femur is thrust into the acetabulum and secured there. Now when all this has been done, although there remains potentially a cavity, there is actually nothing of the kind, for all the surfaces have been brought into apposition. And then, assuming that jjerfect asepsis has been observed, all these sui-faces ought to unite with a minimum of exudation. After the operation the patient is at once placed upon a Thomas’s double splint.

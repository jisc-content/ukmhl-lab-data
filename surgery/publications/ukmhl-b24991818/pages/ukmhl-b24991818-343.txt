The method of commencing and finishing a continuous suture is illustrated in Fig. 93. H.

A fold is picked up upon one side of the wound ; the needle is then carried over to the corres- ponding spot on the other side of the wound, where a precisely similar fold is picked up (Fig. 94). The margins of the wound are turned in, and the serous brought Fii;. 94.—lemuert’s suture. coats are into close contact (Fig. 95). The needle should pick up more than the serous coat; it should include a part or the whole of the muscular coat also. It must on no account trespass beyond the limits of the submucous layer (Fig. 95). The width of the fold picked up will be from one-tenth to one-twelfth of an inch. The closeness of the sutures to one another must vary somewhat according to circumstances. They may be usually estimated at about ten to the inch. It will rarely be safe to apply them less closely than this. As shown in Fig. 94, a number are inserted before any are tied.

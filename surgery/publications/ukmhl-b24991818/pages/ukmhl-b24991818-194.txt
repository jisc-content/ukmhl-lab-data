SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 178 [PAKT 111. Fig. 62.—A, Disarticulation at the knee by the elli])tical method (Bauden’s ojiGration); B, Henry Lee’s amputation of tlie leg. are then well freed along the whole extent of the wound. The skin on the anterior aspect of the limb is turned up in the form of a cuff, while that upon the posterior side of the leg is displaced upwards by gliding merely. By the employment of these two methods the integuments are retracted as far as the patella, the knee-joint being kept extended during the pro- cess. The limb is now flexed a little, the patellar ligament is divided, and the articulation is entered by passing the knife between the semilunar carti- lages and the head of the tibia, as in the operation last de- scribed. Both the patella and the semilunar cartilages are pre- served. The ligaments having been divided as already described, the soft parts at the back of the joint are severed by a circular cut with the knife, made from before backwards. The cicatrix resulting from this operation is transverse, and is placed upon the posterior aspect of the limb. A very excellent stump is obtained.

342 chapter VI. Intestinal Anastomosis. • By intestinal anastomosis is understood the establishment of a permanent fistulous communication between the in- testine above and the intestine below the seat of some more or less permanent obstruction. 1. Lateral Aiiastoiiiosi!^ by Suturing.—The two pieces of intestine which it is intended to join together are drawn out of the abdominal wound and supported by warm sterilised compresses or flat sponges. The contents are expelled by gentle pressure, and clamps applied above and below the site of anastomosis. Smith’s or Hartmann’s clamps will be found convenient. The free surfaces of either piece of intestine are turned towards each other, and it is ascertained that they can be easily made to lie in con- tact, and that the clamps do not interfere with this. On the convex surface of each intestinal loop a continuous suture of fine silk, which traverses the coats down to the submucous layer, is passed, and tied at either end. The suture follows the axis of the intestine. Just in front of this the intestine is opened for from one and a half to two inches by a longitudinal incision made with a tenotomy knife or fine scalpel, and enlarged with fine scissors. Any fluid contents which have remained after clamping are wiped away. A continuous suture—fastened off at short intervals by knots—is then carried through the whole thickness of the circumference of the wound on either side. Finally, a continuous suture is passed through the outer coats of the intestine in front of the anastomotic opening. The clamps are removed as soon as possible, a few Lembert’s stitches applied wherever it seems advisable, and the loops returned into the abdomen after gentle cleansing.

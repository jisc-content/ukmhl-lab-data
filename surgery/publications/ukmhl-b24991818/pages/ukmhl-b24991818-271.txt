255 CHAP. XIV.] EXCISION OF UPPER JAW. 6. The surgeon finally grasps the. bone with lion forceps, holding the instrument with its blades opened vertically. One blade takes hold of the orbital plate, and the other of the alveolus. The maxilla is then wrenched from its few remaining attachments. These will in part concern the orbital plate, and in part the attachment existing between the maxilla and the pterygoid process. The separation of the bone from the last-named process may be aided by bone-cutting forceps bent at an angle and introduced behind the maxillary tuberosity. Care must be taken at this stage that the soft palate is freed completely from its connections with the hard. Without bringing much force to bear upon the forceps, the bone is finally removed. 7. Any bleeding from the depths of the cavity should now be checked so far as is possible. It will usually be desirable to plug the cavity with gauze. Iodoform or cyanide gauze may be employed. The amount introduced must be noted, and the ends of the strips so placed that they can be readily Iâ€™eached from the mouth. A silk thread may be attached to the end of each strip, and brought out of the mouth and fastened to the cheek. The actual cautery may sometimes be used with good effect to check the haemorrhage. The skin wound is finally united very carefully with silkworm-gut sutures, especial care being taken to accurately adjust the red margin of the lip. No harelip pins are necessary in any ordinary case.

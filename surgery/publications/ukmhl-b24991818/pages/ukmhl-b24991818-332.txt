CHAPTER II. Ovariotomy. Instriiiiients Roquircul.—The following special in- struments are required, in addition to those already enumei’ated as needed for the operation of abdominal section. Ovariotomy trocar and cannula with tubing, Ndlaton’s volsella (two pairs), plain volsella, pedicle needle, simple trocar. ^ 1. Tlic Incision.—The abdomen is opened after the manner already described. The incision should be of such a length as to enable the surgeon to extract the tumour with ease. About three inches is the avei'age length of the skin incision when lirst made. It may be commenced about three inches below the umbilicus. 2. Exposure and Exaniination of the Cyst.— The cyst is exposed, and is recognised by its. white shining surface when free. Occasionally the peritoneum is found to be much thickened, or to be adherent to the cyst wall. In attempting to demonstrate the cyst under the latter con- dition, it should be remembered that to cut prematurely into the cyst is less serious than to strip the peritoneum from the parietes, under the impression that it is the wall of the cyst. If any ascitic fluid be discovered, it should be allowed to escape, and should be pressed out of the flanks by the assistant. As soon as the peritoneal cavity is opened, a ruptured ovarian cyst may be discovered. The effused matter can be best got rid of by irrigation with warm sterilised water, at blood heat, and continuing the washing until the fluid flows out clear.

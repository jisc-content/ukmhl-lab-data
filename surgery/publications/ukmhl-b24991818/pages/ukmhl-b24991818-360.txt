344 CHAPTER VII. Enterotomy. The term enterotomy is applied to an operation which is carried out in cases of intestinal obstruction, and which consists in opening the distended bowel above the seat of the occlusion and allowing its contents to escape. This involves, of course, an abdominal section. The procedure is sometimes known as “Helaton’s opera- tion.” It is assumed that the loop of bowel which is opened will belong to the small intestine, and in the majority of instances this proves to be the case. It has always been considered a feature of the operation that, after the abdomen has been opened, the most convenient distended coil which presents should be incised and a fsecal fi.stula forthwith established. It will be obvious that the term enterostomy would moi’e precisely represent this operation than the term enterotomy, which woi;ld imply the mere cutting into the bowel, as in the removal of an impacted gall-stone. Tlie Operation. — The abdomen is opened in the riglit iliac region—if Helaton’s method be strictly followed —by an incision parallel to and a little above the outer part of Poupart’s ligament. The incision is placed to the outer side of the epigastric artery, and its length must depend upon the thickness of the parietes. One inch and a half and three inches will represent the extremes. French surgeons advise a cut of 7 cm. (2f inches). As soon as the abdomen is opened, the first distended coil of intestine that presents is seized and drawn into the wound. It will probably belong to the lower ileum. The convex part of the distended knuckle is drawn well into the parietal wound, but the convex or free border should alone project.

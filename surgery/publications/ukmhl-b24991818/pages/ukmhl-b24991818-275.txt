259 CHAP. XV.] EXCISION OF LOWER JAW. lower border of the jaw at the spot at wliich it is intended to remove the wedge. The bone liaving been well exposed and the periosteum divided, a wedge of' bone is removed with a keyhole saw, aided by the chisel and a periosteal elevator. After all bleeding has been checked the wound is closed by sutures. Excision oi llie Condyle of tiic .law.—This operation is identical with the so-called excision of the temporo-maxillary articulation. A vertical incision is made over the site of the joint and condyle. It is placed anteriorly to the temporal, artery, starts at the lower margin of the zygoma, and ends below, just short of the transverse, facial artery. The temporal arteiy may be considered to run about a finger’s-breadth in front of the tragus, while the transverse facial artery is a little less than a tinger’s-breadth below the zygoma. This incision may be joined by a second cut, vdiich, starting from its upper extremity, follows the lower margin of the zygoma for about one inch. TJie triangular dap thus marked out is reflected for- wards. Care is taken not to damage any branches of the facial nerve nor any lobe of the parotid gland. Such fibres of the masseter as come into A'iew are separated from the zygoma, the capsule of the joint is exposed and opened, and the condyle brought well into view. The neck of the condyle is now steadied by means of a small blunt hook, and is divided either with a chisel or a keyhole saw. The condyle is then seized with forceps, and is twisted out with the left hand, while the surgeon severs any re- maining connections with a scalpel held in the right. Throughout the whole operation it is important that all instruments employed should be kept close to the bone.

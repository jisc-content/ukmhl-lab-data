CHAPTER III. Osteotomy for Oenu Valgum. Aiintoniical Points.—In the severer forms of genu valgum—and it is in these only that osteotomy is practised —there is a great increase in the size and depth of the in- ternal condyle. This is due— as has been shown by Mickulicz ^ —to an increase in the diaphy- sis of the bone rather than in the epiphysis (Fig. 71). Tlie epiphyseal line is about on a level with the tubercle for the adductor magnus tendon. The trochlear surface of the femur belongs to the epiphysis. A ti’ansverse section of the femur about the epiphyseal line, will show that the outer part of the bone is much more exten- sive than the inner part, and this disproportion is continued for some little distance up- wards in the less expanded part of the bone (Fig. 72). The medullary canal ceases some A, Line of ejjiphysis; B, Trans- -^yay above the point at which verse line drawn at level of p . -i .j adductor tubercle; 0, Line of of the bone widens Macewen’s operation. out to foi’m the condyloid ex- tremity. Indeed, none of these operations concerns the canal. The following operations will be described :— THE LOWER END OF A DE- FORMED FEMUR, FROM AN EXTREME CASE OF GENU VALGUM.

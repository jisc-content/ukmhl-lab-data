250 [PAKT IV. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. condyle of the femur, be carried across the front of the limb over the middle of the patellar ligament, and end at the posterior part of the other condyle. The patellar ligament is divided, the joint fully opened, and the skin flap with the patella turned up upon the thigh. The knee is now flexed at a right angle, and the interior of the joint well exposed. The surgeon then proceeds to remove all the diseased synovial membrane, and such of the extrasynovial tissue as is also involved. The latter would include all softened ligamentous tissue. As much as possible should be re- moved in a continuous layer by means of the scalpel and forceps, or the scissors and forceps. The semilunar cartil- ages are removed, and probably both lateral ligaments. The crucial ligaments should be spared whenever possible. They must be stripped, however, of every trace of diseased membrane, must be most carefully inspected, and subjected to a vigorous scraping over all suspicious parts. The articular surface of the posterior ligament must be exposed, and also freed of all degenerate and pulpy tissue. This ligament should not be divided, nor should any opening, if possible, be made into the popliteal space. When the interarticular district has been completed, and the work of the scalpel or scissors followed up by the sharp spoon, until no trace of disease has been left behind, the surgeon turns to the anterior flap. All the synovial membrane which covers this flap should be dissected off, the subcrural bursa must be fully opened up, and its lining membrane treated in the same way. Every nook and cranny must be patiently explored, and every fragment of tuberculous tissue removed. The complete removal of every scrap of diseased tissue from the subcrural bursa is very important. Here again also the erasion must be completed with the sharp spoon, and every neglected point and corner sub- jected to a careful and complete scraping.

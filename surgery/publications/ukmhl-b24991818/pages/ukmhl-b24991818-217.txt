Linear osteotomy implies the division of the bone in its continuity in a single line, usually transverse and made by the subcutaneous method. Cuneiform osteotomy is the term applied to the cutting out of a wedge-shaped piece for the relief of such deformity as that represented by the curved tibia met with in rickets. Osteotomy loith resection of part of the shaft of a long bone is done occasionally to bring two unequal limbs approximately to the same length. l■l•!>t^llIllCllts Employed.—The following ai’e the instruments required in these operations:—(1) An ordinary scalpel; (2) chisels and osteotomes of various sizes ; (3) mallet; (4) sand bag, or large block with plane surfaces ; (5) blunt hooks. The Chisel has the same form as the ordinary carpenter’s chisel. It is square at the end, and has a very sharp edge. It should be made of the finest steel, and be very carefully tempered. The part of the instru- ment near the cutting edge is alone I’aised to a great degree of hardness ; the rest of the blade is kept softer, so that there shall be no danger of its snapping. The edge is bevelled on one side only, according to the ordinary pattern, and the thickness of the blade at the base of the bevel is

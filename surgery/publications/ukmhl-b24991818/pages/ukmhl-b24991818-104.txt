If an attempt is to be made to secure the flexor tendons for reasons already given (p. 83), the divided extremity of each *(or the free end of the flexor profundus tendon only) is attached to the remains of the fibrous sheath and to the glenoid ligament (which is left in the st.ump). The tendons are thus made to occupy the fibrous sheath, which is readily closed around them. DISARTICULATION OP FINGERS AT THE METACARPO- PHALANGEAL JOINTS. The following methods will be described :— 1. By the oval method. 2. By lateral flaps. 3. Operations for the forefinger. 4. Operations for the little finger. 1. By tlie Oval or Racket Method.—The dorsal incision is commenced just above the head of the meta- carpal bone {i.e. opposite to its neck), and is carried down in the median line of the finger until it has passed the base of the phalanx. The cut now divides, and its limbs sweep obliquely across each side of the root of the finger. They are joined on the palmar as^iect by a transverse incision, which exactly follows the crease between the finger and the palm, and is therefore level with the free margin of the web. The surgeon, having made out the position of the joint, holds the finger in the prone position in his left hand. An assistant steadies the hand and keeps the other fingers out of the way. Throughout the whole operation the limb is kept in the prone position. The knife is entered upon the dorsum, and is carried first across one side of the root of the finger and then across the other side. The incision is completed by the transverse

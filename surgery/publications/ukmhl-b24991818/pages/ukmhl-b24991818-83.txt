CHAP. II.] OPERATIONS UPON NERVES. 67 bone is thin and oflers little resistance, and the nerve, which must be most carefully preserved and carefully followed line by line, forms the guide to the surgeon’s movements. When the posterior wall of the maxilla is reached, the white and conspicuous nerve will be hanging loose in the cavity of the antrum. Slender dissecting forceps with long blades are needed during this stage, and become still more necessary when the region of the foramen rotundum is reached. The bone of the hinder wall of the antrum must be so completely removed that the nerve is seen to hang free in the cavity produced. By means of the long slender forceps and a direc- tor the surgeon endeavours to make out the position of the trunk as it issues from the foramen rotundum, and, if possible, the precise locality of the ganglion. In this attempt he is aided by the infra-orbital nerve, upon which traction (by means of a silk thread) is maintained. Finally the .superior max- illary nerve is divided close to the foramen rotundum by a pair of very slender curved scis.sors, and any branches which still hold the nerve in position having been divided, the whole trunk is removed with the ganglion attached. The nerve cord removed should measure not less than one inch and thi’ee-quarters. The antrum having been sponged out, the skin incision is united by sutures and the selected dressing applied.

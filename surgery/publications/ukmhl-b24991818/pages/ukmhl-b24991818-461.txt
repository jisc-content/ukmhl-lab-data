445 CHAPTER II. Operative Treatment of Hydrocele. Rxcisioii of tlie Parietal Part of tlie Sae.— This operation is the most certain to lead to a cure of tlie hydrocele, and conforms to the modern principles of surgery. This method is especially adapted for hydroceles of the tunica vaginalis or of the epididymis in adults. Hydroceles of the cord are also best treated by excision, though in this case the entii’e sac is removed, whereas in hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis only the parietal portion is removed. An incision about three inches long is made over the long axis of the hydrocele at its upper part, and is canned down through the cremasteric layer. With forceps the tissues immediately covering the sac are peeled off on either side, whilst the hydrocele is pushed out of the wound as far as practicable. It is convenient not to open the sac until it has been well laid bare on either side. A puncture is then made and the huid evacuated ; the sac is laid freely open with scissors and then cut away. Care must be taken in doing this, to keep just outside the epididymis externally and not to injure the vessels of the cord or the vas deferens internally. It should be remembered that in old hydroceles the body of the epididymis is often displaced from the testis by a pouch. Fig. 116 shows the relation of the up])er part of the sac to the cord, etc., aCnd indicates how much may safely be cut away. It is easy to destroy the epithelial covering on the testis by scraping it lightly with a Volkmann’s scoop, but it may be doubted whether this is necessary. In any case rougli handling of the testis should be avoided. Any bleeding points are secured with pressure forceps, but ligatures are rarely required.

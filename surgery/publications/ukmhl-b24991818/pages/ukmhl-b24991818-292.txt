276 [part VI. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. slot directed towards its point. The needle is then thrust through one side of the palate, and the other needle passed unthreaded through a corresponding point on the opposite side of the cleft. With this second needle the loop is caught in the slot, and both needles are then withdrawn. With slight practice the operator will find this method to be one of the most rapid. A number of small Turkey sponges in sponge-holders are required, and the necessary material for the various sutures. With regard to the suture material, much must depend upon the custom of the individual surgeon. Hoi’.sehair answers admirably for the uvula, and for the lower and flaccid part of the velum. It is distinctly not suited to any part where there is tension. The sutures should be of full length, should be cai’efully selected, and should be softened before the operation by immersion in warm sterilised water. Horsehair sutures should be tied in thi’ee knots. For the principal sutures—for those that have to bear strain—silkworm-gut answers admirably. It causes, as a rule, no irritation. It should be prepared by immersion in hot water. The fine gut should be used, as it can be readily knotted, a single “surgeon’s” knot being employed. Po!sitiou of the Patient.—The upper part of the body must be well raised, and the head be [)laced suffi- ciently high to prevent the surgeon from stooping. The head should rest upon a hard cushion, or be received in a depression in a sand-bag. It must be thrown well back. The table should be narrow. The surgeon stands on the right, facing the patient. r OPERATION ON THE SOFT PALATE. The gag having been introduced, the first step is to pare ' the edges of the cleft. The tip of one half of the uvula is seized with the tenaculum forceps, and is drawn upon so as to make the palate tense. With a sharp-pointed knife the edge is now pai’ed from below upwards, i.e. from the free

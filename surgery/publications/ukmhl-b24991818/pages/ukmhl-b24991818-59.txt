CHAP. IV.] LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. cadaver. If in dividing tlic soleu.s the knife be not kej)t towards the tiliia, a too e.vtensive division of muscle results, and the wound is unnece.ssai'ily deepened. In identifying muscle it should be remembered that the fibres of the soleus in this situation are attached only along the narrow line formed by the inner margin of the tibia. The .surgeon should not lose sight of the fact that the part for which he is aiming is in a line witli the outer margin of the tibia. THE POPLITEAL AHTEUV. The guide to the upper part of the artery is the outer border of the seini-membranpsus. The jiopliteal ends on a level with the lower part of the tubercle of the tibia. 1. of the I..o\ver Part tlie Artery. Operation.—The patient is so rolled over as to rest upon the shoulder and one side of the chest, and is indeed made to lie as nearly prone as the circumstances attending the administration of an amesthetic will permit. The limb is fully extended. The surgeon wdll .stand to the outer side of the left limb and to the inner side of the right. The chief assistant is placed opposite to him. In the case of either extremity the incision is made from above down- wards.’ A vertical incision—from three to three and a half inches in length—is made over the back of the limb, commencing opposite to the centre of the popliteal space {i.e. the level of the knee-joint), and extending downwards over the in- terval between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle. The skin and superficial fascia having been divided, cai’e must be taken- not to damage the short saphenous vein and nerve. These structures will appear at the outer ])art of the wound, and should be drawn outwai’ds. The deeper fascia is divided in the same vertical line. The heads of the gastrocnemius muscle are now exposed, and the surgeon follows the interval between them. On each side of this gap a sural artei-y wdll be found, accomjianied by the nerve to the corn'sponding head of the muscle.

SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 134 [part III. surgeon sits to the front and the inner side of the foot. The four surfaces of the digit—dorsal, plantar, internal, and external—should be noted and conceived to be each of equal extent. The joint-line is made out, and the toe being grasped with the left hand, the knife is entered over that line and at a point where the dorsal and internal surfaces meet. An incision, 2 cm. in length, is made along the toe, parallel to the extensor tendon and on the line between the two sui’faces named. It is then curved downwards over the inner surface to the plantar margin (Fig. 43). The toe is now turned in, and the knife, placed beneath the mem- ber, is drawn across the plantar surface to the edge of the web between the toes. The knife is next held above the toe, and the incision completed by a cut to the point of starting, made by the shortest route. The whole of this in- cision should involve the skin only. It should now be deepened down to the bone in the same order. In draw- ing the knife across the plantar surface, extend the toe, so as to cut the flexor tendon high up. Dissect back the flap, keeping close to the bone. In so doing, the assistant should hold the toe and turn it to one or other side as required, while the surgeon uses his left fingers to turn back the soft parts. Separate the tissues about the point of starting; clear the soft parts from the surface of the joint. Forcibly extend the toe, and cut the glenoid ligament transversely close to the base of the phalanx. The joint is thus opened; the ligament, with the sesamoid bones, remains behind. Divide the latei’al ligaments, and finally cut the extensor tendon. Close the fibrous sheath of the flexor tendon by two fine catgut sutures. llmmorrhage.—The outer plantar digital artery will be found cut close to the web, the inner vessel at the free end Fig. 43.—DISARTICU- LATION OF THE GREAT TOE BY INTERNAL PLANTAR FLAP.

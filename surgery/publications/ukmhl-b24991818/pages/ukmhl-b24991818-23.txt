7 LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. CHAP. I.] The ligature should be passed and be tied exactly at right angles to the line of the artery. The knot should be tied quietly and slowly, and not with a vicious jei’k. It should be sufficiently tiglit to rupture the inner coats. Care should be taken that the vessel is not dragged out of place in the tying. The points of the two forefingers should meet upon the artery as the knot is being tied, and the final strain upon the ligature should be given by placing the terminal knuckles of these two fingers in contact and using them as the fulcrum of a lever. The knot should be a reef-knot (Fig. 1), not a “ granny.” Fig. 1.—The figure to the right shows a reef-knot, that to the left a “granny.” The double-hitch, or surgical knot, is not suitable, more especially when catgut is employed. With this material it may be found to be impossible or very difficult to tighten the knot about the artery. Moi-eover, the knot when made with catgut forms a considerable mass, and is at the best a clumsy method of occluding the vessel. Tlie I’eef-knot, if well tied, will not fail.

217 CHAP. V.] EXCISION OF JOINTS. Saw.s of various kinds. Chisels and mallet. Bone gouges. Sharp spoons. General Coiulitions of Excision Operations. —In performing excision of a joint, the following general points are to be observed :— 1. The whole of the diseased tissue must be removed. 2. The amount of the bone removed must be limited by such common surgical requirements as are necessary to ensure the prospect of a useful—or, at least, not utterly useless-—limb. •3. The soft parts must be as little disturbed as possible. 4. It is important in young subjects that the active epiphysis be not destroyed, lest a greatly shortened limb I’esult—a matter of infinite consequence in the lower extremity. 5. The bones must be so divided as to be adapted to the purposes of the new articulation, or be favourable for ankylosis in a good position. Tlie Open ITIetliod and tlie Snhperiosteal Hletliod.—The excision of a joint may be carried out by either of the two methods just named. 2'he Open Method.—In the open method the bones are exposed through the simplest and most direct incision j the soft parts are disturbed as little as is possible; any tendons which may be attached to the bones to be excised are not cut through, but are peeled off or separated from their point of attachment. The ligaments of the joint, or certain of them, can hardly escape division. The bones are protected, and are sawn off, but no cai’e is taken to separate and preserve the periosteum which is attached to them. - The Suhperioetecd, Method.—In the subperiosteal method the articular ends of the bones are exposed, ])robably through a similar incision to that observed in the open method. The object of the opei’ator, however, is to save if possible the whole of the periosteum of tlie involved

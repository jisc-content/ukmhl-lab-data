SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 306 [part VII. Wlien the body is of irregular shape, and has been long impacted, very great difficulty may be experienced in re- moving it. I was occupied in one case for more than twenty minutes in extracting from the gullet a hard-metal plate of teeth, which had been impacted for eleven months. By the introduction of forceps through. the wound, foreign bodies have been extracted from the thoracic seg- ment of the oesophagus. If the wound in the gullet be a clean cut, if the case be recent, and the foreign body have been impacted for but a short space of time, then the oesophagus incision should be closed; and this more especially applies to the cases of children and young subjects. The subires employed should be of very fine catgut, and they can be most conveniently introduced by means of a curved needle, held in a Hage- dornâ€™s holder. If, however, the body has been long impacted and the gullet is much ulcerated, or if the wound in the gullet has been lacerated, and has been exposed to much bruising, then the use of deep sutures had better be dispensed with. The skin-wound in such case may be narrowed above and below by a few suture points, but the median and main part of the wound must be left open. A good-.sized drain- age-tube should be passed to the bottom of the wound. In no case is it well to entirely close the superficial wound, even in instances where the incision in the oesophagus has been united. The wound in the gullet may yield, or may be torn open by violent vomiting, and the food-matters and mucus which find their way into the tissues of the neck should be permitted the very freest means of escape. If in a case where the gullet wound has been closed no sign of extravasation occur for seven days or so after the operation, then the superficial wound may safely be closed. An open wound is the great safeguard after ocsopha- gotomy.

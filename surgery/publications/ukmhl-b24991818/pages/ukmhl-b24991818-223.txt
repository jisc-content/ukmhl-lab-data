The osteotome is introduced, and the bone is divided immediately below the lesser trochanter and in a line at right angles to the shaft of the femur (Fig. 70). Comment.—In these situations the bone should be divided com- pletely. It should not be partially cut through and then fractured, lest dangerous splinters of bone be produced. The assistant therefore should be careful how he holds the limb, and how he brings pressure to bear uiion the parts which are being divided. Of the two methods described— viz. that of division of the neck, and that of division of shaft—the latter may be said in general terms to be the better, certainly the simpler and the easier operation. ^ Fig. 70.—OSTEOTOMY EOIl EAULTY, ANKYLOSIS OE THE HIP.

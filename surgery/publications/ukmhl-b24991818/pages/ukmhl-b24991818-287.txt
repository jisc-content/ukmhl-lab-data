IIA RE-UP. CHAP. I.j ■11 \ maxilla. This can bust be effeuteil by means uf small sharp- l)oiiited scissors curved on the Hat. The sci.ssors must Ije kept close to the bone. It may be necessary to detach one ala of the nose from the maxilla. In any case the detach- ment should be sufficiently free to allow of the margins of the cleft coming together readily and without the least tension. If the maxilla of one side pi'oject inconveniently beyond its fellow, it should be forcibly bent back with sequestrum foi’ceps, the blades of which are protected by indiarubber. Second Step.—The edges of the cleft are pared. The lower angle of one flap of the lip is seized with line-toothed dissecting foi'ceps, is drawn upon, and the margin is then pared with the narrow scalpel. The incision f(jr paring the edge should commence above, at the upper angle of the gap, and, descending obli(piely, should curve inwards, when the red margin or lower angle of the flap is nearly reached (Fig. 81). When one side has been treated, the other is dealt with. Ur the lip on one side having l)een made ten.se, it may be transfixed in it.s*wliole thickness from before backwards l>y the narrow scalpel. The point is entered just above the lower angle of the flap, and, the edge being directed u]>- wards, the knife is made to cut towards the iqqjei- angle of the gap, to follow that angle, and finally to descend upon the other side. The knife is then withdrawn, and is not allowed to cut its way out. The piece isolated by paring will still be attached to the lip at both ends, and its detach- ment may be left until some of the sutures have been introduced, and until the amount of tissue recjuired for the formation of a good free margin to the new lip has been ascertained. In any case the paring must be freely, libei-ally, and evenly carried out. The raw surface should be as wide as }»o.ssible, es|)ecially below. Fig. S-t. —opEK.vnoN roK siNcn.E iiAUE-ur.

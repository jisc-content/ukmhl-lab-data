39G surgical operations. [part viii. ribs' may be drawn forcibly upwards with a strong re- tractor. The individual structures in the pedicle should be exposed and isolated as far as is po'ssible by rapid dissection. The ureter is well isolated, and secured between two ligatures. The vessels are then secured separately, or in as small bundles as possible, the arteries first and the veins ' afterwards. Silk or kangaroo tendon is used to secure the pedicle, and it is conveniently passed by means of a stout aneury.>m needle. The ligatures on the vessels should be applied as far from the kidney as is possible. As each ligatui*e is being drawn tight, all traction upon the pedicle must be taken off. The pedicle is next divided with blunt-pointed scissors close to the hilum of the kidney. The kidney is now removed. The pedicle is examined. Any bleeding point detected should be at once seized with pi*essure forceps, and secured later. Such luemorrhage may depend upon the existence of aberrant or abnormal branches that have escaped the ligatures on the pedicle. The ureter is then examined. If it appears healthy it is left as it is, securely ligatured. If it be dilated and occupied with foul or tuberculous pus, then as much of the ' tube as can should be excised above a ligature applied as low down as possible. The possible existence of abnormal veins and arteries must always be borne in mind. These vessels may escape the clamp or the ligature, and yet be severed when the kidney is removed. In more than one recorded case fatal hfemorrhage has resulted from this cause. The wound in the parietes is now closed by sutures. These should be of silkworm gut, and should be passed deeply, so as to embrace the various layers of tissue divided. 2. ABDOMINAL NEPHRECTOMY.

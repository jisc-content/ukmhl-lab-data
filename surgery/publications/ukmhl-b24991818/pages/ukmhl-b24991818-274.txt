2i38 [part IV. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. Some surgeons divide the coronoid process with a chisel and mallet, and subsequently dissect out the fragment of bone thus isolated. The jaw is still further depre.ssed, in order that the condyle may be brought into view. The external pterygoid muscle is reached, and is de- tached with the elevator or divided with scissors. The capsule of the joint is .severed, the articulation is opened and the condyle freed. Throughout this stage of the excision the jaw should be merely depressed. It should not be twisted. If it be much everted or rotated out, the internal maxillary artery may be brought into contact with the neck of the bone, and may be accidentally divided or even torn. It only remains now to cut, the bone free of its few surviving attachments, which are represented by the internal lateral, styld-maxillary, and pterygo-maxillary ligaments, together with more or less fascia and the remain- ing libx’es of the outer pterygoid muscle. All bleeding having been checked, the wound is united with silkworm-gut sutures. The chin part of the incision should be adjusted with especial care. A drainage-tube may be introduced into the hinder part of the wound, and retained there for twenty-four hours. A dressing composed of a sponge dusted with iodoform, and kept in place by a layer of wool and a supporting bandage, will be found to be efficient. Esiiiai'cli’s Operation.—In this operation a wedge- shaped piece of bone is removed from the horizontal portion of the maxilla, with the intention of establishing ii false joint. The wedye of bone to be removed must be taken from the horizontal ramus of the jaw, anterior to the masseter and in front of the contracted tissues. The base of the wedge will be below, and in an ordinary case in an adult should measure one inch and a quarter. The apex is at tho alv'eolar border, and should be about three-quarters of an inch in width. An incision .some two inches in length is made ;ilong the

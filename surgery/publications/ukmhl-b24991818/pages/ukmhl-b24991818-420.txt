404 Part IX. OPERATIONS ON HERNIA. CHAPTER I. Operation for Strangulated Hernia. Iiisti'iiinciits required.—A scalpel and hernia knife ; dissecting forceps; fine-toothed forceps ; pressure and artery forceps; blunt-pointed bistoury ; hernia direc- tors ; blunt hooks j needles; scissors ] sutures. In the event of its being necessary to resect a portion of the pro- lapsed intestine, clamps, intestinal needles, and suitable sutures should be at hand. The hernia knife should be as simple as possible, and should have a short cutting edge. “ Guarded knives,” “ herniotomes,” and other complex instruments for dividing the stricture, should be avoided. 1. l]xposiirc and Opening- ol tlic Sac.—An in- cision is made over the neck of the sack, and as a rule in the long axis of the tumour. This incision should be placed as far from the genital region as possible; thus in the case of inguinal hernia it should not encroach on the scrotum. The various layers between the integument and the sac are divided by clean and pi’ecise cuts that involve the whole length of the incision. Any vessels that ai’e liable to be divided are secured with pressure forceps. There is no need to use a director in dividing the tissues which cover the sac, and that dangerous instrument can vei’y well at this stage be di.spensed with. It is needless to say that the various precise anatomical coverings of the sac cannot be identified as they are divided.

SURGICAL OPFAtATIONS. 14 [PAHT I. The white line, when it does exist, indicates the tendinous margin of the flexor carpi iilnaris. This tendin- ous tissue belongs to the tendon of origin of the muscle, and not to that of the insertion, as usually stated. At the level of the centre of the forearm there is seldom any trace of the tendon of iiusertion. A faint variety of the ^yhite line is sometimes produced by an unusual intermuscular septum. The flexor carpi ulnaris is much more closely adherent to this septum than is the flexor sublimis, and Fig. 5.—TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE FOREARM (DIAGRAMMATIC), TO SHOW THE INTERMUSCULAR SPACES ABOUT THE MIDDLE THIRD. Initials indicate the tendons and muscles, a, Ulnar artery inter- space ; 6, Intersiiace to be avoided; x, the surgical line of the ulnar artery ; 1, Ulnar vessels ; 2, Radial vess^s; 3, Median nerve. It when the fascia is divided the septum adhd’es to the former muscle, thus producing a species of fascial margin. The intersiiace between the two muscles in question is not quite straight, i.e. is not quite vertical when the limb is in position for operation. The flexor carpi ulnaris overlaps the flexor sublimis a little, and the line of the interspace is directed as is shown at a in Fig. 5. The fibres of both the muscles follow the long axis of the limb. If the division of the deep fascia be exactly in the line of the skin incision, i.e. inAhe line of the artery x (Fig. 5), the knife will probably cut upon the flexor carpi ulnaris.

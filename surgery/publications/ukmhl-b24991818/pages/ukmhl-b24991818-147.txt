Disai'ticiilntioii o( tiic Plialaiix of tlie iiJi’eat Toe.—Large Plantar FLaj).—Hold the toe be- tween the thumb and first two fingers o.f the left hand— the thumb on tlie pulp of the toe, the lingers on the nail. Cut the plantar flap as the toe is thus held. Enter the knife—at right angles to the sui’face—just over the head of the first phalanx. Cut along the side of the toe to the ]3ulp. This incision should be parallel to the phalanx and nearer to the dorsal than the plantar aspect. Shape the flap as shown (Fig. 41) and return to the same point on the opposite side. The incision should extend down to the bone. Let the assistant for- cibly extend the last pha- lanx while the flap is dissected back, it being held by the left hand while so doing. In making this flap the surgeon must keep as close as possible to the bone. When the glenoid ligament is reached, cut it transversely against the base of the last phalanx. The joint is thus opened. Now let the surgeon forcibly flex the toe and make across the dorsum a transverse cut that at once divides the extensor tendon and opens the joint. Rotate the toe out, and carefully divide the internal lateral ligament. Rotate it in and divide the external band, and the disarticulation is complete. In disarticulating, keep the knife very close to tlie bone, so as to avoid wounding the plantar digital arteries. Cut the lateral ligaments from without inwards. The cicatrix of the stump will come well on the dorsum. I he long plantar flap should not be cut by transfixion. By so doing the vessels are needlessly damaged and the flap is apt to be scanty.

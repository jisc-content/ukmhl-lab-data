112 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [paet m. the joint as possible, and should pass close to the anterior surfaces of the radius and ulna. The muscles are cut obliquely, and an anterior flap is thus formed. An assistant draws up this flap, and the surgeon, keep- ing his knife close to the bones and almost flat, cuts upwards until the anterior a.spect of the joint is reached. Nothing now remains but to disar- ticulate in the manner already described, and to divide the triceps and any tissues which have escaped division along the lateral and posterior aspects of the limb. A curved cicatiix on the posterior aspect of the limb results. Hamorrhage.—ln addition to muscu- lar branches, divided with the cut muscles, the radial and ulnar arteries will be found severed near the free end of the anterior flap; and on the deep surface of that flap the inter- osseous artery, and possibly the posterior ulnar recurrent, may require ligature. Bleeding may also occur from the terminations of the superior profunda in front of the external condyle, and of the inferior profunda behind the inner condyle. 3. By L-argc Aiilerior Flap*— The base of the flap should represent more than half the circumfex’ence of the limb, and should be U-shaped. The antei’ior incision should commence three-quarters of an inch below the line of the joint on the inner side, and one inch and a half below that line on the outer side. The extremity of the flap (the curve of the U) should reach some three inches below the articulation. The posterior incision is made to connect directly the extremities of the anterior incision (Fig. 37). Fig. 37.—DISARTICU- LATION AT THE ELBOW - .lOINT BY ANTERIOR FLAP.

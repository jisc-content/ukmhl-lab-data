450 OHAPTEE IV. Amputation op the Penis. This operation is required principally for cases of epi- thelioma. I■lstl’llnlellts required.—For the operation to be described, the following instruments are needed : An elastic band tourniquet; a gum-elastic catheter ; a scalpel; a narrow straight bistoury ; straight and curved scissors ; a tenaculum ; dissecting, toothed, and artery forceps ; small curved needles and needle holder for the urethra ; straight needles ; ligatures. of file Free Portion of llie Penis liy Uorsnl Flap.—The hair about the root of the penis having been shaved off, the parts are rendered as aseptic as possible in the usual way.

Previous to the operation the rectum and bladder should have been emptied. An elastic tourniquet—a No. 9 soft rubber catheter answers admirably—is tied around the root of the penis. The tourniquet may be prevented from slipping forward by applying it behind a sterilised hare-lip pin used to transfix the penis. The end of the penis is then held by an assistant with forceps, and a rounded doi'sal flap of skin and fascia shaped out and dissected up. This flap must be of sufficient dimen- sions to cover the whole section of the penis, and it should be made well behind the edge of the epithelioma. The flap being held back, the ])enis is transfixed with a narrow- bladed bistoury between the corpus spongiosum and the corpora cavernosa.

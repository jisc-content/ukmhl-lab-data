C'liiieif'oi'iii Osteotomy.—In this form of the opera- tion a cuneiform or wedge-shaped piece of bone is removed to remedy an abnormal curve or angular deformity. It has been applied in the treatment of the curved femora and tibim I’esulting from rickets, in some cases of bony anky- losis at an unusual angle, and in a few examples of angular deformity produced by maluniou after fracture. The exact size and shape of the wedge must be carefully Fig. 69.—Diagram to show the Lines of the Chisel Cuts in Cuneiform O.steotomy for Angular Deformity after Fracture, etc. determined, and must obviously depend upon the position and e.xtent of the deformity. In general terms, it may be said tliat the sides of the wedge should be at right angles to the axis of the bone respectively above and below the seat of the operation (Fig. 69). In actual pi’actice, however, so large a wedge- shaped piece of bone is very seldom removed. If the curvature in the bone be not extreme, many surgeons con- tent themselves with a mere linear osteotomy, leaving a gap between the divided ends when the limb has been adjusted, which gap appears to fill up without complication. In the severer kinds of deformity a wedge may be re- moved much smaller than is necessary to entirely overcome the deviation, a gap of moderate size being left when the limb has been brought into its normal position upon a splint.

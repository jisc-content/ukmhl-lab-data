459 CHAPTER ir. Operation for Anal Fistula. 0|>ci’atioii.—The patient is prepared in the same manner as is described in the previous chapter. He is placed in lithotomy position, and is secured there by a Clover’s crutch. It is as.sumed that an external open- ing exists. A Brodie’s probe-pointed fistula director is inti’o- duced into the fistula, and is passed into the bowel through the internal opening. Not the very least force must be employed. The internal opening might have been already detected, and the passing of the probe may be carried out while a speculum keeps tlie inner opening in view. If the director does not easily pass, a flexible or especially bent probe may be introduced. If the probe is found to present under the thinned mucous membrane in a case in which no internal opening exists, the point of the director should be thrust through the mucous membrane at the thinnest spot. In evei’y case, when possible, the probe should be passed while the left forefinger occupies the rectum and acts as a guide. In a simple case in which the inner orifice is low down, the point of the director may be engaged upon the tip of the left forefinger (lying in the rectum), and may be cautiously, brought outside the anus. Nothing then re- mains but to slit up the fistula with a sharp-pointed curved bistoury. When the inner opening is high up, persistent attempts to bring the point of the director out of the anus may lead to undue laceration of the part. In such a case, the sphincter having been very fully dilated, the interior of the bowel must be well exposed by means of a suitable speculum and well illuminated by

Mayo Robson states that sutures need not be placed in the small posterior vround, but that the main incision into the duodenum should be accurately closed by a double row of stitches, one uniting the mucous membrane and the other the outer coats. The abdominal wound is sewn up in the usual manner, and drainage is unnecessary, unless doubt is felt as to perfect closure of the intestinal wound. III.—CJIOLECYSTENTEHOSTOMY. By this term is understood the establishment of a fistula between the gall-bladder and the intestine. The not leSs uncouth, but less [)recise, term of entero-cholecystotomy has also been applied to this operation. Tin* Operation.—The operation has been performed in many ways, and no settled pi-actice can be said to be established. If possible, the communication .should be made between the gall-bladder and the duodenum ; failing this, the opening should be placed on a loop of the jejunum or the colon. It may be done by suturing, or with the aid of the smallest size of Murphy’s button. Mayo Robson and others have used his bone bobbin as an aid to suturiu" O* but its advantage is doubtful. The operation has been done in two or even three stages, but undoubtedly it is best to comj^lete it in one. The proceeding resembles so closely gastro-jejimo.stomy that no full de.scription is called for. Murphy’s button is particularly suited for establishing the anastomosis. The chief difficulty in performing the operation is perhaps the. prevention of the escape of bile into the peritoneal cavity. Hence the space around the gall-bladder should be packed with sponges before incising that vi.scus, and the orifice of the button should be plugged with cotton-wool pledgets until the surgeon is ready to press the two halves together, when of course the plug should be removed. With good assistance the extravasation of bile can usually be prevented.

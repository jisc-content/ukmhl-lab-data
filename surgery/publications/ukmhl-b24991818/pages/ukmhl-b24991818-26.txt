[PAKT I. 10 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. Comment.—As the supinator longus is not very wide at this part (especially if the artery be sought for at the lower end of the middle third), it is very easy to expose the outer instead of the inner border of the muscle, in which case the muscle is apt to be drawn inwards, and when the dejDths of the wound are opened up the radial nerve is reached. Tliis is tlie common error of beginners. -a The tendon of the supinator longus as a rule first makes its appearance at the outer border of the muscle, so that if this tendinous edge be exposed the operator will know that he has laid bare the wrong side of the muscle. The inner border of tlie sujnnator remains muscular, until it ends somewhat abruptly in the tendon. 3. ill tlic U|>|>ei' Tliii'd of tlic Forcai'iii. Operation.—This operation differs very little from the last. The incision is two and a half inches in lengtli, and is made ill the line of the artery. The centre of the skin-cut corre- sjionds with the part of the vessel to be tied. The radial or other surface vein may be encountered in the siiiierficial part of the wound. After the deep fascia has been divided, the interval between the supinator longus and pronator teres muscles is opened up. There is no diffi- culty in identifying these two structures : the fibres of the supinator are vertical ; those of the pronator are oblujue. In muscular subjects the supinator is so Avide that its inner border cannot be readily exposed. Under cover of the supinator the radial artery Avill be found. The nerve is'not in relation Avith it.

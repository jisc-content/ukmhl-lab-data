It is rarely necessary to encroach upon the scrotum, and the incision need not come below the pubis ; it will then be easy to keep the wound aseptic and protected by the dressing. The cut may at first be some inch and a half in length, and may be enlarged subsequently if required. The sac is exposed; the only layers of tissue which will probably be recognised are the intercolumnar and the cremasteric. The superficial external pudic artery will probably be severed in dividing the subcutaneous tissues. ^ The sac is opened and the contents are dealt with in the manner already described (page 405).

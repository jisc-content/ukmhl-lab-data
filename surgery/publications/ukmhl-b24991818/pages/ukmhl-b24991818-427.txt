411 STRANGULATED HERNIA. CHAP. I.] the putrid contents of tlie sac. A barrier of lympli will have already shut off the gangrenous segment, and this })i'otective barrier is broken down. Should the bowel be in a doubtful condition, the plan last described may be advisable ; but when it is actually gangrenous, it does not a])pear to have much to recommend it. It has been urged, also, that if the strictlu-e be not divided, the intestinal obstruction is not relieved. This argument in faAmur of dividing the stricture is, however, not supported by experi- ence. It will be found that when gangrene has set in, nearly all tension is taken off from the parts, especially when the gas and oedematous effusion which attend the process are evacuated by an incision ; and it is usual to observe hecal matter at once escape when the putrid bowel is incised. If there be no immediate escape of the intestinal con- tents, such discharge will take place as soon as the swelling of the parts has subsided, as a result of the incision of the gut. c. When the Intestine is Wounded.—The bowel may l)e accidentally wounded when too rash a division of the superficial parts is made, when adhesions exist between the gut and the sac, when the altered gut is mistaken for the sac, or when the loop of bowel comes into accidental contact with the edge of the hernia knife as it is being passed through the stricture. The opening made should in each case be closed by means of Lembert’s suture, the loop of gut should be re- turned into the abdomen, and if the wonnd has been extensive, it will be as well to leave the sac open, and to introduce a large drainage-tube, in case the intestine should giv'e way at a later period. THE OPERATION .A.S APPLIED TO PARTICULAR IlERNLE. 1. Inguinal Hernia.—The patient having been pre- pared in the manner already described, an incision is made over the centre of the tumour, and in the long axis of the tumour, and is so arranged that the centre of the wound

4G4 [part XIII. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. elevator at a spot where the bone is entirely divided. Not unfrequently the disc of bone can be grasped with foi’ceps, and lifted out. In any case, some little portion of the inner table will have to be broken through. The trephine disc, if it is to be replaced, may be at once put in a china receptacle containing a warm solution of corrosive sublimate (1 in 2,000), or sterilised watei’, and maintained at a temperatiu’e of 100^ F. In all cases every splinter and loose fragment of bone must be cautiously removed. Depressed fragments which still retain a hold upon the sound bone are left in position after they have been elevated. The edges of the opening in the bone are finally smoothed off with the rongeur or the gouge. 'J'he trephine disc or any large fragment of bone which has been preserved may be replaced as nearly as possible in situ. The flap or flaps of scalp are now brought into place by silkworm gut sutures, and drainage is secured by in- troducing a bunch of horsehair tlu’eads here and there between the stitches, or by a slight gauze drain. II. TREPHINING FOR ABSCESS OF THE BRAIN. 1. Tlic Operation for Cerebral Abscess.—The trephining is carried out in the manner already described. In dealing with an abscess in the temporo sphenoidal lobe a triangular flap, with its base above and behind, will be found to be convenient. This is held up by means of a ligature inserted into its apex. The dura mater is e.xposed, and will usually be found to be without pulsation, and to bulge into the trephine-hole. This change in the membrane is a certain sign, not necessarily of pus, but of increased intracranial tension. The dura mater is incised with the scalpel, and is then opened with the aid of fine scissors and delicate-toothed forceps. The division should be so made as to render the subsequent closure of the rents with sutures possible. A crucial incision will probably be the most convenient. The

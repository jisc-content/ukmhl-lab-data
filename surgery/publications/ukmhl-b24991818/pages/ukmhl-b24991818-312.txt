The great majority of the operations, however, are performed for malignant disease.

Whilst it is still confined to one side of the middle line thei’e is no valid reason for removing the whole organ. Supposing it has infiltrated the anterior portion of both sides, the surgeon may often safely leave a stump formed of the posteidor third or less. If the whole tongue be excised the floor of the mouth will ultimately project upwards and take its place to a surprising extent, but articidation is never so good as if a fair-sized stump has been left, and the constant flow of saliva may prove a nuisance to the patient. The genei’al rule may be laid down to cut wide of the cancer, but leave any perfectly healthy part of the tongue. Recurrence is common in the lymphatic glands, i-are in the stump of the tongue. The particular lymphatic glands which are the dangerous ones with regard to cancer of the tongue may be defined with fair accuracy ; they are shown in Fig. 88. There are one or two lymphatic glands placed in the

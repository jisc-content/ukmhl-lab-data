1^6 SURGICAL OPERATIONS.' [part iir. The leg is again suitably rotated as the knife passes along its course. (2) The tissues of the anterior flap are now pinched up with the left hand, and the muscles contained therein are divided obliquely from without inwards—i.e., from the skin to the bone. The soft parts are so cut that the flap is thinnest at its extremity and thickest at its base. At the latter site it will include the whole thickness of the muscular mass in front of the femur. The tissues are divided obliquely (the edge of the knife being turned towards the bone at the base of the flap), in distinction to the transverse division of parts which obtains in the circular amputations. The muscles of the pos- terior flap may be com^e- niently cut by transfixion. They may, however, be divided in the same way as are those of the anterior flap. Transfixion is better suited for muscular limbs. The muscles are divided well down to the bone at the bases of the flaps. The femur is barred by further retraction of the soft parts, Fig. G4.—A, Amputation of the thigh and is sawn across at by longai^erior ami short p^terior • | ^ ^ flaps; B, Disarticulation at the hip o ” , by antero-iiosterior flaps.

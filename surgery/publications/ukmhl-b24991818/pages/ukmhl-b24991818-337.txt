CHAP. IT.] 321 OVARIOTOMY. It is important, as the ligatures are tightened, that the assistant should relax his traction so that there is no tension of the pedicle. The exact point at which the pedicle is transfixed must be determined by surgical common sense. The ligatures should not be placed quite close to the uterus on the one hand, nor too near the cyst on the other. The threads must be cut short, and the pedicle divided with scissors three-quarters of an inch beyond the line of the ligatures. Before the stump of the pedicle is dropped back into the pelvis, foi'ceps may be attached to either margin of it, so that at any time before the completion of the operation the divided surface may be drawn up for inspection. There is nothing to commend the practice of clamping the pedicle before the ligatures are applied. In examples of very broad pedicle the tissues may have to be ligatured in more than three sections. 8. C'oiiipletioii of the Operation.â€”All bleeding having been arrested, the opposite ovary may be reached by passing the fingers along the uterus, and may be drawn up and examined. The pelvis is now' well sponged out. The stump of the jiedicle should be drawn up by means of the forceps still attached to it, and, it having been examined, the instru- ments may be removed. Sponges should be counted, and the greatest care taken that no sponge or instrument has been left within the abdominal cavity. No drainage will be required. Nothing now remains but to close the abdominal wound after the method de- scribed in the previous chapter. L

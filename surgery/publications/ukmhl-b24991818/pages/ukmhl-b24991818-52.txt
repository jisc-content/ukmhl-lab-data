1 CHAPTER IV. I r i Ligature of the Arteries op the Lower Limb. I j THE ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. Line of the Artery.—From a point midway between the j head of the fibula and the outer tuberosity of the tibia, to j the centre of the front of the ankle-joint. L JLi$;:atiirc in llic Uppoi* Tliii'tl of llie Legf. ^ Position.—The patient lies upon the back. The limb is straight upon the table. The foot projects beyond the edge of the table, and is forcibly extended, and (with tlie leg) fully rotated inwards. The surgeon stands always to the i; outer side of the limb. The incision for the right arteiy is made from above down ; for the left, from below up. Two assistants stand on the opposite side of the table—one steadies the leg and manipulates the foot, the other attends ' to the wound. Ojyeration.—Before amesthetising the patient, the outer K i margin of the tibialis anticus should be, if possible, defined | by causing the patient to contract the muscle. I An incision, three and a half inches in length, is made I precisely along the line of the artery (Fig. 15). Its upper , end will be about one inch below the head of the tibia. The : deep fascia is exposed, and is divided along the same line. ' The interval between the tibialis anticus and extensor | communis digitorum is made out. The foot is now flexed * ' to relax these muscles. The space between them is opened L up by means of the finger and the handle of the scalpel. In I doimr this, the external border of the tibia is aimed for, and f should be distinctly felt before the artery is sought. In pro- 7 ceedimr towards this border the extensor communis is held ' v down by the first two fingers of the left hand, while the | 1

CHAPTER VI. Excision of the Wrist. This operation, when complete, consists in the removal of the whole of the carpus, the lower ends of the radius and ulna, and tlie articular extremities of the metacarpus. Lord ListorN <)|>cratioii.—This may be taken as a good example of the open method of excision, as dis- tinguished from the subperiosteal plan. The operation is thus described by Mr. Jacobson, the I'adial incision being made as in Fig. 76 :—“The outer incision is planned so as to avoid the radial artery, and also the tendons of the extensor secundi internodii and indicis. It commences above, at the middle of the dorsal aspect of the radius, on a level with the styloid process. Thence it is at first directed towards the inner side of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb, running parallel in this course to the extensor secundi internodii; but on reaching the line of the radial border of the second metacarpal bone it is carried downwards longitudinally for half its length, the radial artery being thus avoided, as it lies a little farther out. These directions will be found to serve, however much the parts may be obscured by infiammatory thickening. The tendon of the extensor carpi radialis longior is next detached with the knife, guided by the thumb-nail, and raised, together with that of the extensor brevior, also cut; while tlie extensor secundi internodii, Avith the radial artery, is thrust somewhat out- wards. The next step is the sepai’ation of the trapezium from the rest of the carpus by cutting forceps applied in a line with the longitudinal part of the incision, great care being taken of the radial artery. The removal of the ti’apezium is left till the rest of the carpus has been taken away, when it can be dissected out'without much difficulty.

249 CHAPTER XIII. Arthrectomy, or Erasion of a Joint. This oiieration, although it is distinct from excision, may most conveniently be considered here. It consists in fully exposing the interior of the joint, and in removing the whole of the diseased synovial mem- bfane and ligamentous tissue, together with such patches of cartilage or bone as may be the seat of quite limited disease. This removal is accomplished by means of the scalpel, the scissors, the sharp spoon, the gouge, and, if need be, the actual cautery. The measure aims at removing all the diseased tissue, and diseased tissue only. Iiistriiuieuts required.—Excision knife; scalpels; scissors, both straight and curved on the flat; sharp spoons of various sizes and shapes; gouges; toothed forceps; dissecting and artery forceps; pressure forceps; probe; retractors. The Operation (as applied to the knee-joint),—An Esmarch’s band is not required, nor is any form of tourni- quet needed. The patient lies upon the back, with the knee a little flexed and the sole of the foot resting flat upon the table. The surgeon stands to the outer side of the limb, or he may find it convenient to place himself upon the right side in the case of either limb. An assistant placed at the end of the table, and another opposite to the surgeon, hold the limb securely. A third helper by the surgeon’s side attends to the sponging, etc. A curved transverse incision is made across the front of the knee-joint, as in performing excision (page 242). The incision may be commenced at the posterior part of one

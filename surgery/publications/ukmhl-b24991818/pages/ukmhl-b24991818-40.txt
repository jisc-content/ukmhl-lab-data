The wound throughout should be as bloodless as possible. 1 he outer margin of the anterior scalene muscle should next lie defined, and the position of the omo-hyoid made out. The latter muscle, if at all in the way, must be drawn upwards. When the edge of the scalene muscle has been made plainly evident, the finger should be passed along it until the tubercle on the first rib is encountered. The finger will now be in contact with the artery, and its pulsa- tions can lie felt (Fig. 11). I'ig. 11.—LIGATUUK or THE RIGHT SL'HCLAVI.VX ARTERY (THIRD PART). A, Clavicle; B, Sterno-mastoid; C, Trapezius; D, Omo-hyoid; K, Anterior scalene ; r, Cervical fascia ; a, Subclavian arterj’ ; b. Subclavian vein ; c, E.\t. jugrdar vein; d, Transverse cervical artery ; 1, Brachial plexus. The vessel will be found actually resting upon the bone. A little careful dissection will clear the {irtery and bring into view the lowest cord of the brachial jilexus. This nerve cord should be systematically exposed by a slight and careful dissection. It may be at once said that it has been the source of some of the.more serious mistakes which may be made in this operation. The subclavian vein will be seen and felt, but it seldom encroaches much upon the field of the operation. The transverse cervical arteiy runs high up, and will probably not come into view.

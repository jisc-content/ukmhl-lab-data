Lig^atui'C at tlic Place of Election (above the Oiiio-liyoid Itiuscle). Operation.—The position of the cricoid cartilage having been defined, and the situation of the super- ficial veins made evident, an incision about three inches in length is made in the line of the artery, and is so placed that its centre is on a level with the cricoid cartilage (Fig. 12). The skin and platysma having been incised (to- gether with branches of the superficial cervical nerve), the surgeon di- vides the deep fascia along the anterior border of the sterno - mastoid muscle. Along this bor- der a communicating vein between the facial and the anterior jugular may be met with. The edge of the muscle is defined, and is followed until the omo-hyoid muscle is made out. The superior border of this structure must then be well exposed, and the angle at which the two muscles meet be clearly demonstrated. The sterno-mastoid may be drawn a little outwards, and the omo-hyoid downwards. The pulsations of the artery should now be sought for, and the vessel can usually be ea.sily detected, as it crosses the conspicuous “carotid tubercle.” Fig. 12.—LIGATURE OK THE RIGHT COM- •MOX CAROTID ABOVE THE OJIO-HYOID.

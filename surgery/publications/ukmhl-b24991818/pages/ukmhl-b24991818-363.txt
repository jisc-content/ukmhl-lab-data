347 CHAPTER VIII. OOLOTOMY. By colotoluy is understood the operation of establishing an artificial anus in the colon. This may be either temporary or permanent. Colotomy is carried out for the relief of obstruction in the colon of various kinds, and is most frequently employed in cases of cancer of the rectum. It is performed also as a palliative measure in some examples of cancer of that part in which no obstruction exists. Lumbar colotomy implies the opening of the ascending or descending colon through the loin without wounding the peritoneum. This is known also as the extraj^eritoneal operation, as posterior colotomy, or the operation of Amussat and Oallisen. The idea of the operation—which belongs to the pre-antiseptic days—is to open the colon without wounding the peritoneum. The method is now almost obsolete. higuinal colotomy implies the opening of the sigmoid Hexure, or the caecum, through an incision in the iliac region which involves the peritoneal cavity. TLis is known as the intraperitoneal operation, as anterior colotomy, as Littre's operation, as laparo-colotomy, and as inguinal colotomy. Lumbar colotomy has been almost entirely abandoned in favour of the inguinal operation. Indeed, a colotomy in the loin has become a very rai’e operation.

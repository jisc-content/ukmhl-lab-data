193 AMPUTATIONS. CHAP. XVIir.] following order from before backAvai’ds : the femoral artery, the femoral vein, the profunda vein, the profunda artery» The first vessel to be sought for after the main trunks are ligatured is the internal circumtiex. It will be found divided in the tissues about the inner and posterior side of the acetabulum. The branches of this arteiy often give much trouble. The descending branch of the external cir- cumfiex is found cut close to the inner edge of the vastus externus. The trans- verse branch of that artery will also probably require a ligatui’e. In the posterior segment of the wound the comes nervi ischiadici is early recognised, and Avill require liga- ture. Bleeding will occur from other branches of the sciatic artery, and from many muscular branches distributed about the surface of the Avound. Varieties of the Operation. — {a) Farneaux Jordan's.—Mr. Jordan gives the following description of his opera- tion ;—“A straight incision Avas made, and the trochanters and upper part of the shaft Avere freed from their muscular attachments, after Avhich the capsule Avas opened. Next the shaft Avas cleared downwai’ds from all its attachments for a considerable distance, and then a few free .sawing movements with a long- bladed knife through the thigh, from Avhich the bone had been removed, ended the operation. The integuments Avere simply draAvn upwards, and the soft parts Avere cut straight through. No bone being left, the muscles quickly retracted, and Avere easily covered by the skin. Very little blood Avas lost. . . . The principle of the operation may be thus described ;—Fii’st enucleate the bone, then cut through the limb at any desired II Fig. (55.—FORNEAUX .tuudan’s ampu- tation -AT THE HIP JOINT (“ Surgical Enquiries,” Plate X., page 288).

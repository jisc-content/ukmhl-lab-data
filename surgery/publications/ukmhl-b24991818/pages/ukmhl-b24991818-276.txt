Pari V, TENOTOMY. Including Opkhations for thf Division of Contracted Muscles, Ligaments, and Fasct.e. The Siilx’iita neons iTIelliod, — The object of this method is to divide the tendon with the least dis- turbance of the surrounding parts and with the smallest possible division of the skin. Air is not admitted to the deep wound ; the risk of sepsis is thus minimised, and the surface punctured heals readily and surely. Before the introduction of the antiseptic method of treating wounds, the subcutaneous operation was all-essential. It is now much less important. At the present time it need only be carried out when convenient and po.ssible. In any case in which the tendon is not manifest or is difficult to discover, or in which its relations with nerves and vessels are complex and intimate, it is better to adopt the open method of the older surgeons, and to expose the area of the operation by a free incision. Use of llie Tenotome.—The tendon or band of fascia to be divided is usually unduly prominent, or can be readily made distinct. The tendon should, if possible, be so cut as to avoid opening a .synovial sheath. The tenotome should be lightly held, as one would hold a pen. The shai’p-poiiifed instrument is carefully intro- duced close to the tendon, and makes a way for the blunt- pointed instrument. It is essential that it sliould make an ample passage for the blunt-pointed tenotome, and there- fore the cutting point may need to be moved freely to and

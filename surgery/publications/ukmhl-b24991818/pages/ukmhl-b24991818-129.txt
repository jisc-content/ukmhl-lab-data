CHAP. AMPUTATIONS. 113 Tlie position of the operator has been already indicated. The anterior flap should be marked out by a skin incision, the limb being at the time extended and the hand supine, and the knife should be entered upon the boi’der of the forearm most remote from the surgeon. The muscular part of the flap is cut by transfi.xion, precisely as in the anterior elliptical method. The flap is drawn up, and the posterior incision made. The operation is completed as in the disarticulation by the anterior ellipse, and the blood-vessels are divided in the same manner. Many surgeons cut a short postei’ior flap about one- half or one-thii'd the length of the anterior flap Coiiiiiieiit.—Several methods of disarticulating at the elbow-joint have been advised or practised, in addition to those described. Among these may be mentioned the amputation by lateral flaps, the external being the larger; by antero-posterior flaps, the anterior predominating ; and by a racket incision, the queue of which is over the olecranon; and by a single external flap. The elliptical method—and notably the arnjDutation by the anterior ellipse—is on the whole the best, pi’ovided, of course, that the tissues upon the flexor side of the limb are sound.

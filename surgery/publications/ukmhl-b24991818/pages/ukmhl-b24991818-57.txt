The linst canal in the annular ligament (that nearest to the malleolus) con- tains the tibialis posticus tendon; the second contains the tendon of the He.xor longus digitorum canals has a separate synovial linin space wider than that for either of the two named canals, in which are lodged the vessels and nerve. A fourth canal on the astragalus, lined also with a synovial mem- brane, transmits the flexor longus pollicis tendon. 2. Li^;:itiii‘o at tlie Lower Tliird of the Leg:. Operation.—The position is the same as in the pi-evious o})era- tion. An incision, two inches in length, is made along the line of the artery midway between the mai-gin of the tendo Achillis and the inner edge of the tibia (Fig. 18). The superficial and deep fascim are divided, together with the upper part of the inner an- nular ligament. The artery is found lying on the flexor longus digitorum muscle, with the nerve to its outer side. The needle is passed from the nerve. The vente comites will have to be included if they cannot be readily separated from the artery (Fig. 19). 3. Ligature in the lYlitldle ot tlie Calf.

Operation.—The position is the same as in the pre- ceding operations. The calf of the leg rests upon the table on its outer side, and the surgeon leans over the limb. The incision is made from above downwards on the right side, and from below upwards on the left. The assistant,

4G7 CHAPTER IT. OpERATTOXS ON THE ]MlDDLE EaR AND THE ^NFAffTOTn Antrum. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS. The lloor of the middle fossa corresponds externally to a ridge passing back from the zygoma—-its 2^osterior root—towards the asterion, or meeting of the j^Jii’ietal, occij^ital, and temporal bones. This ridge can always be felt, as also a slight depression at its hinder end where the jiarietal bone fits in. • The lateral sinus grooves the mastoid jjrocess for one-third to one-half of its width, more deeply and exten- sively as a rule on the right side of the body than the left. Running down obliquely from the dej^ression mentioned above to the anterior border of the mastoid jirocess is a strongly-marked ridge produced by the insertion of the sterno-mastoid muscle. This ridge corresponds, as a rule, fairly closely with the anterior border of the lateral sinus. As shown in Fig. 120, the operator may safely work in a triangle bounded above and behind by the two ridges described, and anteriorly by the wall of the external meatus. This triangle is nearly equilateral, each side measuring 2‘5 cm. or 1 inch. The gouge, etc., should be made to traverse the bone inwards and slightly forwards, jmrallel to the meatus itself. In young children, especially, the cranial cavity is entered with ease, and this accident may have fatal results. It is most undesirable when opening a mastoid antrum full of pus to wound the lateral sinus, as the operation cannot be pi’operly completed, and Semitic thrombosis is almost certain to follow.

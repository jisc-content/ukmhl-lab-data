CHAP. II.] LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. carpi uliiarls muscle and tlie flexor sublimis cligitorum (Fig. 5). The jiosition of this interval is sometimes indicated by a white line. The gap is, however, best demonstrated by the touch, the left forefinger being used for tlie purpose. As soon as the intermuscular space has been made evident, the wrist is a little flexed to relax the muscles. The flexor carpi ulnaris is now drawn in- wards by means of a broad- bladed reti’actor. The flexor sublimis is in like manner drawn a little outwards. The surgeon opens up the vertical intermuscular space thus de- monsti-ated, and at the bottom of it will probably first be found the ulnar nerve. To the outer side of the nerve is the artery (Fig. 4). The fascia binding down the vessels in this situa- tion is slender. There is usually no difficulty in separating the artery from its ven^e comites. The needle should be passed from within outwards, so as to avoid the nerve. Comment. —This operation is associated with considerat)le difficulty if carelessly per- formed, and the procedure is surroumled by many possibili- ties of error. The chief difficulty is to demonstrate tlie gap between the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor sublimis muscle.s. The “ white line ” which is said to mark this gaj) is not to be relied upon. There may be no trace of such a line; it may be very faintly indicated, or the position of the inter- space may be marked by a yellow fatty line. The white line is best seen in young muscular subjects. Fig. 4.—UGATCUE or uight Ur.VAli AKTEUY AT THE MIDDLE THi;iD or THE rOUEAUM. Dcejt Wound.—a.

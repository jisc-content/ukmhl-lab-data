138 CHAPTER XL Partial Amputation of the Foot. AMPUTATIONS THROUGH THE TARSO-METATARSAL JOINTS. These operations consist in the removal of single toes, with their respective, metatarsal bones, and in the removal of the whole of the metatarsus by Lisfranc’s and Key’s operations. Insti'iiments.—A stout knife with a blade three inches long. (For the flap operation upon the great toe a more slender knife, with a blade of about three and a half inches in length). Narrow metal retractors. Lion forceps (in the event of the part being crushed). Dissecting, pressure, and artery forceps. Position.—The same as for previous amputations. (/See page 130.) * DISARTICULATION OP A TOE, TOGETHER WITH ITS METATARSAL BONE. 1. Disarticulation of tlie Great Toe, n ilh its Itictatarsal Bone, by Oval or Racket Incision.— Having defined the metatarso-tarsal joint, grasp the toe with the left hand, and enter the knife at the inner border of the foot, just below the line of the joint. Carry the incision outwards, parallel to the articulation line, until the centre of .the dorsal aspect of the metatarsal bone is reached. Now continue the cut straight down towards the nail,’along the median line of the dorsum of the bone. 'Ibis incision will lie to the inner side of the extensor proprius pollicis tendon. On reaching the centre of the metatarsal bone, incline the incision to the web, then round the outer side of the root of the toe (the phalanx being turned out), and so on to the plantar aspect. Let

LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. CHAP. II.] 9 2. L.i;s:atiii'e in the lYlidiile Tliird of flic Foreai’m. Operation.—An incision two inches in length is made in the line of the artery, the limb being in the position in- dicated. The centre of the in- cision corresponds to the centre of the forearm (Fig. 2). In cutting thi’ough the subcuta- neous tis.sues care must be taken to avoid any superficial vein belonging to the radial or median veins. The anterior division of the musculo-cutaneous nerve lies usually in the line of the ar- tery, outside the deep fascia and just beneath the superficial veins. The deeji fascia is laid bare, and is divided in the length of the original wound. The fibres are transverse. The supinator longus muscle is now exposed about the point where it is beginning to lie- come tendinous. The inner or ulnar border of the muscle is defined, and .the muscle itself is drawn outwards. The elbow may be a little flexed to allow of this being done more easily. The vessel is now found lying upon the insertion of the jn’onator I’adii teres, with which Fig. 2.—Lia.vruRE or the RAoiAr. it is connected by much con- uln.vr arterie.s, and or nective ti.ssue.

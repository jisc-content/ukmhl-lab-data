l1 Part 111. AMPUTA TIONS. CHAPTER I. Methods of Performing Amputation. The following are the principal procedures in amputation :— 1. The Circular Method. 2. The Modified Circular Method. 3. The Elliptical Method. 4. The Oval or Racket Amputation. 5. The Amputation by Flaps. 1. The Circular Method.—In this method of am- putation the soft parts are divided by a series of cii’cular cuts, made from the skin down to the bone. The tissues are not divided by one sweep from integument to perios- teum, but by successive cuts, in such a way that the skin and the layers of muscle are severed at different levels. Two forms of circular amputation ai’e practised at the present day. They are identical in principle, and their diflferences, such as they are, depend upon anatomical features, and are indeed influenced only by locality. (a) The ordinary circular amputation—the amj)ntation cirmfaire injundihidiforme of the French—is illustrated by an amputation through the arm or thigh. In these parts the bone is more or less evenly surrounded by thick muscles. After each circular cut the soft- tissues are allowed to retract, or are retracted, before a second sweep is made with the knife. The result is that the wound liecomes funnel-shaped; the edge of the funnel is formed

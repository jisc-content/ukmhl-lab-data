15 CHAP. II.] LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. By dividing the fascia a little more to the ou^er side as advised, the knife comes upon the dexor sublimis (Fig. 5), and by working inwards tlie oblique gap between the muscles is made out. This, gap is always best demon- strated liy the linger. It is often indicated by one or more cutaneous arteries which escape here and form an excellent guide to the main artery. The interspace should be sought for at the lower part of the wound, and the separation of the two muscles should take place from below upwards. In muscular subjects care should be taken that the incision is made long enough. When the proper interval has been found between the flexor sublimis and the flexor carpi ulnaris, it is not uncommon for the beginner—impressed with erroneous views as to the depths of the artery—to proceed too deeply and too far to the inner side, and actually to ])ass by the ulnar nerve and open up the interspace between the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor profundus digitorum. (5'ee Fig. 5.) This may readily happen if the former muscle be dragged too much to the inner side. THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. Line of the Artery.—When the arm is extended and abducted with the hand supine, the brachial artery corre- sponds to a line drawn from the outlet of the axilla (at the junction of its middle and anterior thirds) to the middle of the bend of the elbow. Position.—In securing the artery at the bend of the elbow, the limb, extended and abducted, may be allowed to rest upon the olecranon. It should not be over-e.xtended. In dealing with the vessel in the arm, the limb should Ije extended and abducted, with the hand supine, and should be held away from the body. The arm itself should not be supported in any way, but the limb should be held by the forearm by an assistant. The surgeon may make the incision from above down- wards on both sides of the body, standing to the outer side of the limb on the right side, and between the trunk and

189 CHAPTER XVIII. Disarticulation at the Hip-joint. mode of Controlling' HcCinorrhage during the Operation.—Various methods hav^e been adopted for pre- venting excessive Inemorrhage during this disarticulation. 1. The femoral artery may be ligatured either befoi’e the flaps are cut or during the fashioning of the flaps when the incision crosses the line of the artery, as in the method known as the “anterior racket” (page 195). The procedure involves a little time, and, when a special incision has to be made, somewhat complicates the opera- tion. The method, however, has many advantages. It has been urged by some surgeons that the artery is apt to be secured unnecessarily high up, and that the vitality of the main flap may be in consequence impaired, but this objection has not been confirmed by practice. The femoral may be compressed in the flap by the fingers of an assistant, who grasps the base of the flap just befoi’e the vessels are divided. This method is illustrated in the amputation by transfixion (page 196). Some surgeons advise digital compression of the femoral or external iliac. This can, however, hardly be carried out except in a child. The fingers ai’e very apt to slip during the manipulation of the limb. In all these methods it is needless to say that the securing of the femoral does not affect luemorrhage from the branches of the internal iliac artery. 2. To prevent haemorrhage from brandies of both external and internal iliac arteries during the operation. Sir William Macewen strongly recommends manual pressure on the aorta. The assistant who does this should stand on a stool placed on the left side of the patient; by

10 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [pakt i. the linih on the left side. Or on the left side the operator may place hiiliself to the outer side of the limb, and bend- ing over it, may make the incision from below u[)wards. 1. :it tliie Bond oftiic Elbow. Operation.—The arm having been placed in the position indicated, the surgeon, by flexing and extending the limb, makes out the exact position of the biceps tendon, and by compressing the veins of the upper arm renders evident the median basilic vein. An incision, two inches in length, is made through the skin, along the inner edge of the bi- ceps and parallel with its margin. The wound will therefore be oblique, and it should be so placed that its centre corresponds to the mark on the skin called the “ fold of the elbow.” Tlie upper end of the incision will correspond to the level of the tip of the internal condyle. If the veins be normally disposed, the skin wound will liq to the outer side of the median basilic vein, and nearly parallel to it. As soon as the vein is ex- posed it .shoidd be drawn in- wards. The bicipital fascia is now demonstrated, and divided in the line of the original inci- sion. Its fibres are directed obliquely downwards and inwards. The-.artery, with its venm.comites, will now be exposed. The vqssel will here be found to be very movable and free from connective tissue attachments, although sometimes surrounded by much fat (Fig. 6, a). The vena3 comites having been separated, the needle is passed from within outwards. The median nerve does not come conspicuously into the field of the operation. It is Fig. G.—LIGATURE OF THE RIGHT BRACHIAL AT THE BEND OF THE ELBOW. Fascia ; B, Bicejjs tendon ; c, Bicipital fascia; «, Ar- teiy ; b, Veme coniites ; c, Basilic vein ; 1, Median nerve.

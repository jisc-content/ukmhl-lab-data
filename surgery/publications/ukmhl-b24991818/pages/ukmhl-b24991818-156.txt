SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 140 [part III. 2. Disarticulation of the l^ittle 'I'oc, with its Metatarsal Bone, by the Oval or Racket Incision. —The toe being grasped by the left hand, the knife is entered at the outer margin of the foot about 1 cm. behind the tuberosity or the fifth metatarsal bone. An oblique cut—parallel with the cubo-metatarsal joint —is made, and a median dorsal incision is carried thence to the neck of the metatarsal bone. Here the oval is made just as in the disarticulation of the great toe (page 138). The subsequent steps of the operation are practi- cally identical with those already described. Hcemorrhage.—In the dorsal incision the dorsal digital arteries of the toe are divided, while the plantar digital vessels are found cut on the plantar aspect of the wound. Special care should be taken not to wound the plantar arch in disarticulating the base of the metatarsal. In a case in which this accident happened, not only was the bleeding very difficult to check, but secondary hiemorrhage occurred a few days later. Any one of the other metatarsal bones may be removed, with its corresponding toe, by the oval incision. The outer two bones may in like manner be removed together by the oval operation, the queue of the oval running along the interosseous space between the two bones. These operations are of little practical value. « LISFRANC’S OPERATION. A disarticulation of the anterior part of the foot at the tarso-metatarsal line. liisti’iiincnts.—A strong, stout, narrow knife, about four or five inches long in the blade; a scalpel; a saw, which will be required for Key’s or other modification ; a narrow metal spatula; pressure forceps, artery and dissecting forceps; lion forceps if the toes be crushed. Position.—The patient lies on the back. The foot is drawn well beyond the end of the table, and is raised upon a support until on a level with the surgeon’s neck. The operator may stand to cut the dorsal flap, but should

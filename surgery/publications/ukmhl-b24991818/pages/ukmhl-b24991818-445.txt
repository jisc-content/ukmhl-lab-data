429 CHAP. II.] RADICAL CURE OF HERNIA. twisted and fixed by sutures iu a small aperture made just above Poupart’s ligament. In either case the passage of the ligatures or of the twisted sac through the lower edge of the abdominal wall is rendered easy and safe by the introduction of the left index finger into the femoral ring to act as a guide. As a rule, especially if the femoral ring be large, an attempt should be made to narrow the latter by sutures passing through Poupart’s and Key’s ligaments in front, and the fascia over the pectineus muscle behind. During the introduction of these sutures the femoral vein on the outer side is carefully guarded witli the finger. Some surgeons use two or more interrupted sutures ; others employ the purse-string method. Many other plans have been proposed for dealing with the femoral ring. Thus a small flap of the external oblique aponeurosis has been turned down and sewn to the pectineal fascia, or a flap of the pectineus muscle has been turned up and sewn to Poupart’s ligament. The muscle, however, makes an unsatisfactory kind of shutter, and probably atrophies in a short time. The conjoined tendon is also sometimes drawn down and sewn to the pectineal fascia. In most cases of femoral hernia, dealing thoroughly with the neck of the sac as high up as possible in the manner described suffices to produce a radical cure ; but, provided that the ring can be narrowed by deep sutures without undue tension on the latter, it is certainly an additional safeguard to employ them.

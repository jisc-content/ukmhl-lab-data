SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 290 [PAKT VII. ging the trachea on either side of the tube with a piece of tine sponge properly shaped and attached to a long silk thread. The incision is prolonged upwards hi the median line, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues are divided down to the cartilage. The incision will extend over the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, the crico-thyroid space, and some part of the thyro-hyoid space. The thyroid cartilage is divided accurately and carefully in the median line, the thyi’o-hyoid and crico-thyroid mem- branes being also cut if needed. The division of the cartilage should be effected from above downwards, and from without inwards. In young subjects, and in females who have not passed middle life, the section may be accomplished by a small but stout knife. In aged subjects, in whom the cartilage will be calcified, a fine saw may be needed to effect a division. Bone forceps should never be employed. By means of two small sharp hooks the two alee are now drawn aside, and the interior of the larynx is exposed. In old subjects it may be necessary to make transverse incisions in the cj ico-thyroid and thyro hyoid membranes, close to their respective cartilages, before the fullest view desired can be obtained. The foreign body may now be extracted or the growth removed. In dealing with papillomatous masses, the bulk of the growth may be crushed off with broad forceps, and the remainder removed with scissors, aided by Volkmann’s spoon. The surface left by the removal of the tumour may then be touched with a saturated solution of chromic acid. Finally, the two portions of the thyroid cartilage are united by two or three tine tendon sutures, and the wound in the skin is closed,

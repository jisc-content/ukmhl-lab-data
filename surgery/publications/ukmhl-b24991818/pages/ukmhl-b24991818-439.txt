The cord is lifted up by two blunt hooks, which are held by an assistant, and a series of interrupted sutures of kangaroo tendon is passed through the lower edge of the muscles that go to form the conjoined tendon, and through the inner edge of Poupart’s ligament (Fig. 114). These sutures are intro- duced in a series before any one of them is tied. They all lie beneath the cord, and care must be taken in % passing the curved needle through Poupart’s ligament that the iliac ves- sels are not inter- fered with. By securing these sutures the internal ring is narrowed. Fig. 114.—BADICAL CUBE OF HERNIA. The aponeurosis of the external oblique has been divided. Three deep sutures (1, 2, 3) have been passed through l.o, the internal oblique, the transversalis, and Poupart’s ligament. E.p, External oblique. The spermatic cord has been purposely omitted in this figure for the sake of clearness. The cord is now replaced and the two edges of the cut external oblique are sewn together again over the cord. The ilio-hypogastric nerve must be avoided, or, if preferred, it may be resected. Finally, any subcutaneous vessels which have been held in pressure forceps are ligatured with tine catgut if necessary, and the wound is closed in the ordinary manner with silkworm-gut sutures without drainage. A sterilised dressing is ajsplied with

SUTURE OF INTESTINE. 325 CHAP. IV.] fitted together. Sometimes a few additional Lembert’s sutures are added, but reliance is mainly placed on a' plastic inflammation, due to the pressure of the button, producing union before the button itself works loose in the intestine. 3. A rigid cylinder of decalcified bone (the so-called “ bobbin ”) is ■ introduced, and over this the two ends of the bowel are drawn and so united as to cover in the cylinder. The cylinder, or bobbin, facilitates the introduction of the stitches, and so shortens the time taken in suturing ; it also acts as a temporary splint, and allows the passage of intestinal contents through its lumen. It may be noted, however, 4. One end of the bowel is invaginated into the other. If pos- sible, the upper end is introduced into the lower. that it soon becomes digested or works loose. Invagination is now chiefly employed in the Fig. 92.—dupuytken’s sutuke. form of Maunsell’s opera- tion, and then only as a temporary method to aid accurate suturing (see page 328). 5. The divided margins of the bowel to be treated are brought together by means of some form of suture. This is efiected without employing any supporting foreign body, and without producing any invagination of the tube. A great variety of sutures has been devised to effect •this object. <|ii:ilificatioiis of a Good Suture.—An efficient intestinal suture should have the following qualifications :— 1. It should bring into contact two broad surfaces of lieritoneum, these surfaces belonging respectively to the bowel above and below the breach to be closed. 2. It should effect a complete closure of the wound, the test being that the seam should be water-tight. 3. The suture should be simple, should be easily intro- duced, and should be capable of effecting a rapid closure of the wound. 4. The thread should take so firm a hold of the tissues

OHAP. XIII.] AMPUTATIONS. 153 to meet the first incision at the sole. If an attempt be made to perform the incision at one cnt, and to make the outer limb of the incision by cutting from the heel towards the leg, the knife may slip and cut too far up into the leg, running by the starting-point. . On the left foot the same pre caution is observed, but the incision is commenced on the outer side. This incision should be carried well and cleanly down to the bone. The heel flap is now dissected back: the thumb- nail of the left hand is used with force to drag back the soft parts, while the knife is kept well on to the bone and parallel to the surface of the flap. The os calcis must be laid perfectly bare. The great point in Syme’s amputation is to “ keep close to the bone.” The flap must be cleared from the tuberosities of the os calcis, and then from its pos- terior surface. 2. The Dorsal Incision.— The surgeon now holds the foot in the left hand in the position of full extension, and connects the extremities of the heel incision by a cut which simply sweeps across the front of the ankle region. The dorsal and the heel incisions are about at right angles to one another. The cut includes all the soft parts down to the bone. The tendons must be cleanly divided while the foot is kept on the stretch. 3. The Disarticulation. — The ankle-joint is at once exposed, the anterior ligament having been severed.

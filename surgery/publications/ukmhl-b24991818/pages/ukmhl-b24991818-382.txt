'I lie Piiriet:il Incision.—The surgeon should Gneleavour to mark out tliG lower edge of the liver by per- cussion and palpation. The normal jiosition of this edge is about two fingers breadth below the ensiform cartilage. 1 he liver, however, in the operation area may be fouml high up as the level of the xiphoid cartilage, or as low down as the level of the ninth costal cartilage. In cases of stricture of the gullet, the organ is usuall}’^ a little lower than normal, owing to the empty condition of the stomach and intestines. The incision is oblique, is parallel to the margin of the left costal cartilages, and is about one inch from that margin. Its length is about two and a half inches, and may be modified according to the thickness of the parietes. The centre of the incision should correspond to a point from three-fourths of an inch to one inch below the margin Fig. 103.—GA.STROSTOMY. A, Incision ; B, Margin of the liver; c, Margin of the costal cartilages ; 7, 8, 9, and 10, Seventh to tenth costal cartilages. of the liver (Fig. 103). The incision is carried through the tissues of the abdo- minal wall. The fibres of the external oblique muscle will be found to run almost at right angles to the line of the wound, and the fibres of the internal oblique to be nearly parallel with that line. The transversalis muscle will be cut transversely. The incision will probably cross the left semi-

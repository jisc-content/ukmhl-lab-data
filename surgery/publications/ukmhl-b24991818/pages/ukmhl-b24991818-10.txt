PREFACE. VI deformities of the lip and Certain operations, such as circumcision and tlie tapping of hydrocele, are not included, as I consider they come rather under the heading of minor surgery. Those who need fuller information upon these and other matters that are involved in treatment by operation are referred to the larger and more comprehensive Avork. The illustrations in this book are selected from among the four hundred and. seventy-three that illustrate the new edition of the “ Manual of Operative Surgery.” FREDERICK TREVES. May, 1904. /

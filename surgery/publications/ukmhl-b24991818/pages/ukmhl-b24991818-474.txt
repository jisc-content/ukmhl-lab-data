[I’AKT XII. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 4i)8 the anal edge of the mucous membi'aue. As each vessel is divided, it is secured by pressure forceps. A little experience will teach the operator where the vessels lie, so that their division is not made unexpectedly. In due course the in- volved mucous membrane (with the original forceps still attached) is entirely removed as an unbroken ring or tube. 'Fhere then remains the divided line of skin with the original forceps still attached, and the divided line of mucous mem- brane, to which some six to ten forceps, securing vessels, will be attached. The sutures are now ready to be a})plied. The best suture material is fine chromicised catgut used absolutely dry. The suture is of good length, and is carried in a curved needle held in a suitable needle-holder. The surgeon passes the needle through the edge of the divided skin, and then, taking up in his left hand one of the forceps affixed to the mucous membrane (and also grasping a cut vessel), he passes the needle through the mucous membrane in such a way as to take up the vessel in question. He then re- moves the forceps and ties the ligature in a firm surgeon’s knot. Thus the cut edges of the skin and mucous mem- brane are bi'ought together, and the divided vessel in the latter membrane is secured by being as it were under- pinned by tlie single suture. In this way the wound is closed all round.. From ten to twenty sutures will be re- quired. No vessel needs to be ligatured, nor even to be twisted. The suture controls each one quite perfectly. Additional sutures are applied when required. The suture involves only the skin, the mucous membrane, and the vessel in the submucous tissue. The .sphincter is excluded entirely from it.

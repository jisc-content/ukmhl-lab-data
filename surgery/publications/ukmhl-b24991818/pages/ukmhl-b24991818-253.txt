EXCISION OF JOINTS. CHAP. IX.] 237 of the heel, ends about one inch and a quarter to tlie inner side of the median line (Fig. 79, c). This cut is met by a vertical incision two inches in length, which is parallel to and a little in front of the tendo Achillis. The wound is deepened, and two small flaps are formed. Great care must be taken of the peronei tendons, to which the vertical incision is posterior. The bone is exposed behind the peronei tendons, and the periosteum is incised vertically. With a rugine the periosteum and the associated ligaments are separated from the bone. The outer surface is cleared first, then the posterior sur- face. The attachment of the tendo Achillis is severed. The foot being placed in the position of talipes varus, the posterior aspect is bared of periosteum as far as it is possible to reach. The anterior portion of the bone is cleared, and the ligaments separated with the periosteum. The same is done with the plantar surface. A certain part of the inner surface can be reached from the posterior aspect. With care and patience and the use of good retractors the greater part of the bone can be bared through this outer incision, and from this side also the interosseous ligament can be reached and divided. When the os calcis is freed as far as possible, the head or anterior part must be grasped with lion forceps and the â€¢ bone dragged outwards with a repeated rotatory movement, the periosteum and ligaments upon the inner surface being separated with the rugine as soon as each part of the as yet untouched district is reached.

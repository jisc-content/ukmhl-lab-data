AMPUTATIONS. Ill CHAP. VI.] the supinator longus, and at a spot a little above the middle of the forearm (Fig. 36). In perfoiTuing this operation the surgeon may con- veniently stand to the left of the limb to be removed—i.e. to the inner side of the light forearm and the outer side of the left. The elbow will be on his light hand, the hand on his left. The elliptical incision maybe made in one sweep from olecranon to olecranon. Holding the wrist in his left hand, and flexing the elbow a little, the surgeon so rotates the limb as to turn the farther side of the forearm towards him. (This will be the radial margin on the right limb, and the ulnar margin on the left.) He carries the incision downwards from the olecranon to the lower ex- tremity of the ellipse. As the knife crosses the anterior aspect of the limb, the forearm is kept extended, with the hand supine. The elbow is once more flexed, and the limb is now so held as to bring uppermost the border of the forearm neai'est to the surgeon.

The knife is carried upwards across the border to terminate at the point of commencement over the olecranon (Fig. 36). The incision involves the skin only. An assistant now takes the forearm, while the surgeon separates and retracts the integuments a little all round. This retraction will shorten the anterior flap about one inch and a half, The elbow being a little flexed, and the hand supine, the operator pinches up the soft parts on the flexor aspect of the liones with the left hand, and then transfixes the limb ti’ansversely. The knife should be entered as near

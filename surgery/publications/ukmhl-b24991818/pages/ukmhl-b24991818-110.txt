94 CHAPTER III. Amputations of the Fingers and Thumr, together WITH PoimoNS OF the Metacarpus. I ■isfriiiiieiits.—A stout narrow scalpel with a blade about 1| inches long will suffice for the oval methods, and a slender bistoury, with a cutting edge of some 2|- to 3 inches, is required for transfixion operations. A fine keyhole saw. Small retractors. Bone forceps. A rugine, if the periosteum is to be preserved. Dissecting and artery forceps. Scissors, needles, etc. Position.—The surgeon sits with the patient’s hand ' before him. The limb should be in the position of prona- tion. The operator grasps the finger to be removed, keeping his hand supine. An assistant, placed opposite to the surgeon, holds the patient’s hand in the required position, and keeps the sound digits out of the way. The following procedures will be described :— 1. Partial amputations. 2. Disarticulation of a finger with its metacarpal bone. 3. Disarticulation of the thumb with its metacarpal bone. 1. Partial Amputations.—As much of the meta- carpus should be preserved as is possible. In such partial operations the deep palmar arch is not exposed to the risk of being Avounded ; the attachments of certain tendons are preserved, the carpo-metacarpal synovial sacs are not opened up, and if the bone be divided beyond its centre the synovial sacs of the flexor tendons may escape the knife in the case of the three middle digits. The racket method should be employed. The vertical

CHAP. XI.] 245 EXCISION OF JOINTS. No blood-vessels of any importance are divided. The arteries actually severed will be branches of the articular arteries, of the anastomotica magna, and of the anterior tibial recurrent. Continued pressure with a dry sponge will be sufficient to check such bleeding as is usually met with. In the majority of instances it is possible to leave the posterior ligament undisturbed, in which case a substantial barrier remains that will prevent the spread of suppuration into the popliteal space should pus be produced. In any case, care should be taken to spare this ligament, and to separate its attachments from the bones rather than to cut it. The internal limit of the incision should not be carried backwaiâ€™ds beyond the point indicated, in case the internal saphenous vein and nerve be wounded. The utmost care must be taken to respect the epiphysis in young subjects. If damaged, it will lead to a shortened, deformed, and possibly useless limb. The femur and the tibia should be sawn from before backwards. With regard to the fixing of the bones with metallic sutures or pegs, it must be observed that such a measure effects its object but feebly, that primary healing is apt to be hindered, that the subsequent removal of the wires or pegs may be difficult, and that the presence of these foreign bodies may excite some mischief in the bones. If a really suitable strong and well-adjusted apparatus be used to fix the limb, the employment of the means just named becomes quite unnecessary.

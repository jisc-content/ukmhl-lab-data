The surgeon flexes the foot with the left hand, his thumb being along the line of the toes and his fingers on the dorsum. The knife is introduced at right angles to the surface of the now well-exposed sole. The incision, com- mencing on the outer side, follows the plantar edge of the fifth metatarsal for a short distance, and then sweeps obliquely across the sole to the neck of the fourth meta- tarsal. It now traverses the sole just behind the line of the Fig. 45.—THE COUP DE MAITRE IN LISERANC’S AMPUTATION : FIRST STEP. [After Guirin.) heads of the metatarsus, and finally follows the plantar edge of the metatarsal bone of the great toe to join the extremity of the dorsal incision. The plantar flap is thus convex forwards, and the inner segment is longer than the outer (Figs. 44 and^49, a). Tlie incision at first involves the skin and the sub- cutaneous tissues only. The assistant now grasps the toes and keeps them fully extended while the surgeon dissects back the flap. This should include the subcutaneous structures only until the hollow behind the heads of the metatarsal bones is reached. When this hollow is exposed, the tightly-sti’etched flexor tendons are divided by a visorous transverse cut. The rest of the flap includes

AMPUTATIONS. CHAP. XV. 175 A second incision begins at tlie same point on the front of the limb as the first, and pur- sues a similar direction across the inner side of the leg, meeting the first incision at the median line upon the posterior aspect of the extremity. The inner flap should be a little fuller than the outer, in order to ensure a sufficient covering for the iiiternal condyle, which is longer and lai’ger than the external. The outline of the flaps is shown in Fig. 60, a. (1) The skin incisions on both the right and the left leg are more conveniently made by cut- ting from behind forwards. The knife is entered at the posterior aspect of the 'limb, at a spot opposite to the centre of the interarticular line, and is di’awn forwards, first upon one side of the limb and then upon the other, to reach the point of meeting one inch below the tubercle of the tibia. While the outer incision is being made the limb is rotated inwards, and vice versd. (2) The skin is freed all round, and the two flaps are dissected up. They should include all the soft parts down to the tendons and muscles, which are well laid bare, but are as yet left uncut. The patellar ligament is cut as soon as it is reached, being divided against the tuberosity of the tibia.

150 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [PAET III. dissect—by cuts made from left to right in the left foot, and from right to left in the right foot—all the soft parts from the inner and under surfaces of the os calcis. Special care must be taken of the vessels which lie in the hollow on the inner side of that bone. Clear the under surface of the bone, still turnino: the foot out. When this process of enucleation is complete, the foot will have been so turned round that the dorsum will face downwards. Now separate the foot, and cut any neglected tendons short. The suture line on the stump is hoi’izontal, and is on the outer side of the extremity. The operation is much easier on the left than on the right foot. In the latter case it may be more convenient to dissect up the great flap and bare the os calcis before the disarticulation is effected. No drainage-tube is required as a rule. Hcemorrhage.—In the part of the flap a to B (Fig. 48) are cut the postei’ior peroneal, the anterior peroiieal, and branches of the tarsal and metatarsal arteries. The largest of these is the first named, which runs just behind the malleolus. In the part B to x the tarsal artery and the dorsalis pedis—the latter a large vessel—are divided opposite the centre of the head of the astragalus. In the part x to D the internal and external plantar are cut. In the margin of the flap D to E branches of the latter vessel are found.

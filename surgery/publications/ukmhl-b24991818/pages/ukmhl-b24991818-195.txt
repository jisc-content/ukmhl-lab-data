CHAPTER XVI. Amputation of the Thigh through the Condyles. In this operation the femur is divided at the bases of the condyles, about the level of the tubercle for the in- sertion of the adductor magnus tendon, or a little above that spot. Tlie patella is removed, except in Gritti’s operation. Iiistriiiiiciit^.—Amputating-knife five to six inches in length as regards its blade. Stout scalpel. Butcher’s saw. Retractors. Six pressure forceps. Artery and dissecting forceps; scissors, etc. Lion forceps may be required. Position,—The position of the surgeon and of his assistants is the same as in the last series of operations (page-174). Two iiictliods will be described :— 1. Carden’s operation. 2. Modification of Carden’s operation. 1. Carden’s Operation.—“ This operation,” Carden writes, “ consists in I’cfiecting a rounded or semi-oval flap of skin and fat from the front of the joint, dividing every- thing else straight down to the bone, and sawing the bone slightly above the plane of the muscles, thus forming a fiat- faced stump with a bonnet of integument to fall over it.” The procedure is as follows :— (1) The incision is commenced "at the most prominent part of the tuberosity of one condyle, and ends at a coi’responding point on the other condyle. The cut over the front of the limb sweeps with an easy curve between these two points, and crosses the median line about the middle of the patellar ligament. The posterior incision is quite horizontal (Fig. 54, c).

288 [part VII. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. The following rules should be observed :— 1. Let the chin be kept rigidly in a line with the sternal notch. 2. Cut only in the middle line. 3. Avoid anxious assistants with retractors. 4. See the white rings of the trachea, and feel them bare before plunging the knife into tlie windpipe. 5. Avoid hurry. II. LARYNGOTOMY. Laiyngotomy, or the artificial opening of the larynx through the crico-thyroid membrane, is occasionally per- formed as a substitute for tracheotomy. The operation has the advantage of being very rapidly and very easily carried out. It is quite inapplicable to children under thirteen years of age, owing to the narrowness of the crico- thyroid space. The great drawbacks of the operation are the ])roximity of the vocal cords and the difficulty of adjust- ing a suitable tube. Laryngotomy is totally unsuited to cases in whicli a tube has to be long worn. T'lic Oi»cratioii.—The head is well extended over a sand-bag or hard cushion, and is kept fixed, with the chin ■ in a line with the sternal notch. The anaesthetic selected is chloroform. The anatomical details of the part must be made out, and the crico-thyroid space defined. The larynx is lightly steadied with the left hand, while the surgeon makes a vertical median incision, about an inch and a quarter long, over the lower part of the thyroid cartilage, the crico thyroid space, and the cricoid. The fascia having been divided, the interval between the sterno- thyroid and crico-thyroid muscles is appreciated, and is widened with the handle of the scalpel. The crico-thyroid membrane is exposed, and is divided horizontally, just above the cricoid cartilage. Care must be taken that the air-passage is well opened, as it is not difficult to pass the tube downwards between the crico-thyroid membrcine and the mucous lining of the windpipe.

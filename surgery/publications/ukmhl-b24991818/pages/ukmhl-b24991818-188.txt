SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part III. 172 The fibula should be divided about 1 cm. aliove the tibia, and the saw should pass obliquely fi’oni above downwards and inwai’ds (Fig 50). The saw is now entered upon the inner surface of the tibia, above the level at which the bone is to be divided. The insti-ument is made to cut down- wards and outwards for a certain distance (Fig. 55, a). Tlie transverse saw-cut is now made from before backwards (Fig. 55, b), with the result that the whole bone is divided, the piece marked out by the first saw-incision drops oft', and the tibia presents a slop- in" surface on its O inner side. This method of dividing the bones is adapted to the ampu- tations by external flap or by two lateral flaps. In the case of amputation by antero- posterior flaps or by the circular method, the fibula may be cut at the same level as the tibia, and the anterior margin of the tibia should then be removed by a sloping saw-cut, the instrument being applied in the manner just detailed (Figs. 55 and 57). The periosteal flap or flaiis having been adjusted over the divided bone, and any deep sutures having been in- serted, the operation is completed by closing the surface wound. ■ T • 1 1 llannorrhage. —The anterior tibial artery is divided at Fig. 58.—APPEARANCE OE THE STOSIP AFTER THE AMPUT.VTTON OF THE LEG AT THE “place of election” by a LARGE EX- TERNAL FLAP.

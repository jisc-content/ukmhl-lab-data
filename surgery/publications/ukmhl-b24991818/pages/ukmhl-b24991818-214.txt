198 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part III. The surgeon now cuts, liy a sawing movement of the knife, a U-shaped anteiior flap some eight inches in length. This flap will end about the junction of the iqiper with the middle third of the thigh (Fig. 64). It should include as much of the soft parts as possible. It will be noticed that the knife is placed obliquely at the commencement of the cutting of the flap, and that it becomes transverse at the termination. More tissue has to be divided on the outer than on the inner side of the limb. If the flap be carelessly cut, it is apt to be too pointed at its extremity. As. the knife is carried downwards, the first assistant slips his fingers under the cut surface of the flap and com- presses the main vessels against his thumbs, which are placed upon the skin. It thus happens that before the femoral is divided at the end of the flap the upper part of th^ trunk is well secured. As soon as the flap is made this assistant di’aws it up- wards out of the surgeon’s way, while he still grasps the great vessels (2) The limb is straightened and is fully extended, i.e., the knee is depressed. The surgeon cuts open the capsule. The thigh is now rotated outwards. The head slips out of the acetabulum, and the round liijament is divided. The thigh, still extended, is now rapidly adducted and rotated inwards, and the muscles about the great trochanter are cut. The disarticulation is complete, and nothing remains but to cut the posterior flap. (3) The whole thigh is now lifted directly up in such a way that the free end of the femur is dragged away from the posterior tissues and is forced forwards. The surgeon jiasses his knife behind the femoral head and the great trochanter, and, cutting downwards, forms the posterior flap. This flap is shorter than the anterior, and the skin is divided about the level of the gluteal fold (Fig. 64). The clearing of the great trochanter is perhaps the most

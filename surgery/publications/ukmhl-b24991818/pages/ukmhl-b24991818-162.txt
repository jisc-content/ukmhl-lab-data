146 CHAPTER XII. Partial Amputation of the Foot [concluded). AMPUTATION THROUGH THE MEDIO-TARSAL JOINT (CHOPARt’s operation). This consists of a disarticulation of the foot at the medio- tarsal joint. fiisti'iiiiiciits and Position. — The same as for Lisfranc’s operation. Operation.—In its main points the procedure is identical with Lisfranc’s amputation. 1. The dorsal flap.—The incision commences at a point midway between the tip of the outer malleolus and the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal on the outer side, and at a point just behind the tuberosity of the scaphoid on the inner side. The cut follows on either side the margin of the foot for a little distance, and is then so curved over the dorsum as to cross the bases of the metatarsal bones (Fig. 47). 2. The plantar flap extends between the two points first named. It follows in the main the lines of Lisfranc’s flap, and has the same shape. It is so carried bver the sole as to cross the middle of the metatarsus (Figs. 47 and 49, b). The flexor tendons are divided as soon as a little skin has been retracted. Both flaps contain all the . soft parts down to the bones. The medio-tarsal joint-line should be well exposed. 3. The Disarticulation.—In disarticulating, the foot may be conveniently held in the position of talipes varus, and be well extended. Care must be taken to open the right joints. It is easy to open the scapho-cuneiform

170 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part hi. downwards, the operator proceeds to dissect up the great Hap, which sliould contain all the soft parts down to the bones. The flap is separated along the "anterior limb of the U incision by cutting from above downwards down to the bone along the outer side of the anterior border of the tibia. The fingers of the left hand are thrust into the gap so made, and the tibialis anticus is seiiarated from the bone. When the muscle is sufficiently separated, it is cut obliquely from above downwards and outwards, with the result that the section of the muscle will be thin when the margin of the skin is reached. The whole of the soft parts involved in the external flap are dissected up from the bones and intei’osseous mem- brane. In effecting thi^ the finder and the handle of the scalpel are used more freely than the knife. The muscles should be cut obliquely at their lower exfremities, so that the section of muscle close to the free margin of the skin —i.e. at the bend of the U—shall be quite thin. The anterior tibial artei’y is divided at the free end of the flap in making one of these oblique sections of the muscles Fig. 55.—METHOD OF SAWING THE TIBIA.

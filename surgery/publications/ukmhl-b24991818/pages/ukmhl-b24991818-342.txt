No unsupported suture should pass through all coats Fig. 93.—A CONTINUOUS SUTURE RUNNINU I'TIOJI LEFT TO RIGHT. A double knot is tied at the commencement. After traversing a short distance, the suture is tightened and secured by a loop (1, 2, 3, 4); at its end a second knot is made by tying the single thread (a) with the loop [a) in a double knot. of the bowel—i.e. it should not pass from the lumen of the gut to the serous covering of the same. 7.

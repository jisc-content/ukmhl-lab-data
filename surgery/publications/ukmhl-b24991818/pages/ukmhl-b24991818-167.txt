151 CHAPTER XIII. Amputation of the Foot. Two procedures will be described :— A. Disarticulation at the ankle-joint. B. Intracalcaneal amputation of the foot. A.—DISARTICULATION AT THE ANKLE-JOINT (sYME’s amputation). This is the principal operation for removing the entire foot. The flap is made from the heel, the soft parts having been peeled off the os calcis. The two malleoli, together with the articular surface of the tibia, are sawn off. The blood supply of the heel-flap is a matter of great im- portance ; the two chief vessels of supply are the external calcaneal of the posterior peroneal on the outer side, and the internal calcaneal of the exteimal plantar on the inner side. The first-named vessel is a continuation of the posterior peroneal. It runs just behind the inferior tibio-fibular joint, and then behind the outer malleolus to the heel. With regard to the internal calcaneal artery, the posterior tibial divides “on a level with a line drawn from the point of the internal malleolus to the centre of the convexity of the heel.” This line is dangerously close to the line of the incision. The internal calcaneal artery arises from the external plantar, close to the bifurcation and under the fibres of origin of the abductor pollicis. Inasmuch as this is the chief vessel of the flap, the greatest care must be taken of it. [See page 155.) Minute branches may reach the flap from the internal malleolar of the posterior tibial and from the outer and inner malleolar of the anterior tibial.

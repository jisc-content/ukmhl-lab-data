322 CHAPTER m. Removal of the Uterine Appendaoes. The removal of the uterine appendages in cases wliere the structures are anatomically normal, or practically so, is an exceedingly simple procedure. When, however, the appendages are diseased, the surgeon who proposes to remove them embarks upon an enterprise the precise course and ending of which he cannot foretell. Some of these operations are difficult and com- plicated, and present a very uncertain and intricate series of conditions. The operation will be described as it would be carried out in a case in which the parts are practically normal. InstI'liiiieiits required.—The same as for ova- riotomy with the exception of the trocar, the volsella, and the cyst forceps. The Operation.—The patient having been prepared for abdominal section, a vertical incision about two inches in length is made over the linea alba below the umbilicus. The centre of the cut will be nearer to the symphysis than to the umbilicus. The cavity of the peritoneum is opened in the manner already described. The intestines and great omentum will be largely prevented from getting in the operator’s way if the patient has been placed in Trendelenburg’s position— i.e. with the pelvis raised above the level of the thorax. All bleeding having been checked, two fingers are in- troduced into the wound, and the fundus uteri is sought for. The fingers embrace the broad ligament as if they were the blades of very long dressing forceps, and are carried out- wards—one on each side of the tube—until they are arrested by the ovary.

CHAP. IV.] 215 OSTEOTOMY. apex of the wedge ; its base is represented by the part from which the skin has been already removed. The foot is now firmly fixed so as to bring the dorsum well into view, and with an elevator the tendons and all the soft parts are raised from the dorsum of the tarsus. The elevator is introduced through the outer incision, and the surgeon works from without inwards. The instrument must be kept close to the bone, and the area to be I’epre- sented by the wedge must be laid entirely bare. In the same way the tissues are cleared from the under surface of the tarsus as far as possible, so that with the chisel or osteotome a bony wedge can be cut. This wedge has its base outwards and the apex at the scaphoid bone (Fig. 71). The wedge, being grasped by lion forceps, is further cleared with the scalpel and elevator and prized outwards. The operator pays no attention to the exact bones removed—which will include the cuboid and parts of the cuneiform. , The wedge can usually be lifted out in one piece. Any hcBinorrhage having been dealt with, the portions of the foot are brought together; and if the deformity be not fully corrected, the neck of the astragalus should be divided transversely through an incision made on the inner side. The large gap should now be well washed out by a stream of sterilised water from a suitable irrigator. In this way all bone dust and debris are removed. The wounds are closed with sutures, and a drain may be introduced into the lower parts of the external wound.

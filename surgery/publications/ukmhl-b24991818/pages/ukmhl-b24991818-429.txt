CHAP. I.] STRANGULATED HERNIA. 413 applied, and is fixed in place by means of a spica bandage, which should be applied while the thigh is in the position of flexion. When the limb is brought again into the extended posture the bandage is drawn tight. 2. Fcinoi’iil Hernia.—The usual preparations having been made, a vertical incision is made along the inner side of the tumoiir, and is so placed that the centre of the cut will about cori'espond with the upper border of the saphenous opening. The wound will be at first about one inch and a half in length, and may be enlarged as required. The exact position and extent of the wound must depend on the individual case, but the further from the genitals it is placed the more easily will asepsis be obtained. As a rule, no vessels of any note are divided in exposing the sac. The operation is completed in the manner already described (page 405). The stricture is usually formed by the margin of Gimbernat’s ligament, and should be divided by cutting upwards and inwards—i.e., towards the median line. In reducing the bowel the thigh shoidd be a little Hexed, adducted, and rotated in. A similar spica is applied to that used in inguinal hernia. 3. Iliiibilical Hernia.—In addition to the instruments already enumerated, the surgeon should be provided with ivory spatuhe, curved needles in handles, and large curved needles. The patient is prepared as for an abdominal section, and the general disposition of those concerned in the operation should be the same as is observed in that procedure. The surgeon will always stand to the patient’s right. Nearly the whole of the skin involved in the protrusion is now marked oH‘ by means of an elliptical incision, the long axis of which will correspond to the median line. The incision will extend, indeed, on to the median line above and below the swelling; and as it crosses the tumour it will

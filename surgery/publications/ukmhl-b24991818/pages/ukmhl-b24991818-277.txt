The sharj) tenotome is witlidrawn, and the blunt in- .strument inti'oduced witli tlie blade “Hat”—that is, in a line with the line of the skin-wound. The instrument should throughout bo kept close to the tendon or band to be divided, and care must be taken to avoid damage to adjacent A'essels or nerves. The breaking of the point of the teiiotome against the bone is a not very infrequent accident. As the tenotomes are being introduced the tendon should be only sti’etched to .such an extent as is neces- sary to render its position distinct. It needs to be stretched to its utmost when its fibres are being divided, but this tension may be a little relaxed as the last strands are being cut. The tendon is divided with a sawing move- ment ; it cuts with a creaking sound or sensation, and yields finall\' with a snap. A common source of failui’e after this operation is due to an incomplete division of the tendon. The left forefinger should'be kept upon the skin at the site of the operation, in order that the movements of the tenotomes beneath the integument may be followed and guarded. PARTICULAR OPERATIONS. Til»ialL«( .4iiti4*ii<ii Toiidoii.—This tendon descends through the innermost sheatli of tlie annular ligament, and, crossing the ankle-joint, astragalus, scaphoid, and internal cuneiform bones, is inserted into the inner side of the last- named bone and the base of the first metat'ai’sal bone. The .synovial sheath which accompanies it extends upwards for some distance above the level of the malleoli. A small bursa lies beneath the tendon as it crosses the cuneiform bone. I'his tendon is usually divided as it is crossing the scaphoid bone, and consequently about one inch above its insertion. At this point it should be free of its synovial

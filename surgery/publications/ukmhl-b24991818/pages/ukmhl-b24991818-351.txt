335 CHAPTER V. Resection op the Intestine. Under this title are included operations which concern themselves with the removal of compai’atively small por- tions of either the small or the large intestine. Excision when applied to the lesser bOwel is termed enterectomy, and when carried out in the colon, colectomy. The details of the operation will be considered under the following headings :— 1. Enterectomy with circular suturing of the divided ends. 2. Enterectomy with the aid of Murphy’s button. 3. Enterectomy with the establishment of an artificial anus. 4. Methods of uniting segments of intestine of unequal size. 5. Colectomy. I. ENTERECTOMY WITH CIRCULAR SUTURING OF THE DIVIDED ENDS. 1. The abdomen having been opened, the first step is to isolate the loop of intestine to be excised. This loop should be drawn well out of the parietal wound. Any adhesions which prevent it from being well exposed and isolated must be divided. If any extravasation has taken place into the abdominal cavity, it should be dealt with before the resection is com- menced. The part to be resected is placed ujion a fiat sponge, and the whole wound through which the intestine has been drawn is well and carefully packed all round with gauze or sponges. It should be impossible for any intestinal matter to find its way into the peritoneal cavity. 2. The bowel must be occluded above and below the

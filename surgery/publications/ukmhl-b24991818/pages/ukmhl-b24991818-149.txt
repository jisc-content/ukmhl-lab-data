Separate the soft parts from the phalanx as high up as ])ossible, and divide the bone. Close the sheath of the flexor tendon (page 81). The vessels are cut as in the last instance. The cicatrix should be vertical, i.e. dorso-plantar. Amputation through the first phalanx may also be effected by two lateral flaps of equal size cut by transfixion with a narrow bistoury. Comment.—In disarticulating the second phalanx, re- move the head of the first phalanx, or replace the operation by an amputation through the latter bone at the level of the web. The head of the first phalanx is large* and is apt to play the part of a foreign body between the other toes when it is left. Its removal is no detriment to the use of the foot. As has been observed elsewliere (page 95), the bone should be divided by a very fine saw rather than crushed by forceps. B.—DISARTICULATION AT THE JIETATARSO-PHALANGEAL JOINTS. 1—Disarticulalioii of the Great Toe at the Itletatarso - Plialaiig^eal Joint.—^In this operation notice must be taken of the very large size of the head of the metatarsal bone. Its dimensions are increased by the presence of the sesamoid bones, which should never be removed with the phalanx. It is of considerable import- ance to the future use of the foot that the head of the metatarsal bone should be pi’eserved, and it will be seen that the chief difficulty of the operation is to provide flap enough to cover the projection. It is important also that the scar should be away from the plantar surface and the line of the sesamoid bones. The joint can be readily made out by manipulation, especially on the inner aspect of the foot. It is placed about an inch behind the web. The projection of the sesamoids can also very easily be defined. (1) By Internal Plantar Flap {Faraheuf).—T:\\Q

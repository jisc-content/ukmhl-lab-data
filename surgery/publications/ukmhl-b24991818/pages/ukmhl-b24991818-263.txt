CHAP. XII.] EXCISION OF JOINTS. 247 terniinates in one of Barker’s flushing-gouges. These instruments consist of a gouge with a canal running through the liandle, so that a stream of water may be directed into the hollow of the gouge. The abscess having been cleared out by means of the rush of hot water, aided by these flushing-gouges, the neck of the femur is sawn across with a narrow saw in the direction of the external wound. The diseased head can then be lifted out by means of the flushing-scoop or a sequestrum forceps, through which the hot stream is rushing into the joint. By the time the head of the bone has been got out, the whole cavity is comparatively clean. Now begins the search for further disease. This can usually l>e estimated by the left forefinger, Avith Avhich the acetabulum is first examined, and then all the other parts of the joint-cavity.

When every ]iart of the field of operation has been gouged and scraped clean of all tuberculous material, and the Avater runs away clear, the cavity is dried out Avith sterilised sponges, one or two of Avliich are left in it until all the stitches are placed in position. These should dip deeply and be placed close together. .Just before they are tied, the sponges are removed, and Avith them the last traces of moisture.

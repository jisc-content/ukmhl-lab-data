Pari VII. OPERATIONS ON THE NECK. CHAPTER I. Traciikotomy and Laryngotomy. I.—tracheotomy. The operation is said to be “ high ” or “ low,” according as the trachea is opened above or below the isthmus of the tliyroid body. In the adult the isthmus crosses the second and third rings of the trachea, and sometimes even the fourth. In the child the isthmus is narrow, and is 'usually somewhat higher up. It may even lie on the crico-tracheal membrane. The high operation is always to be preferred ; it alone is described in the account which follows. i'<Mliiirod.—Scalpels; dissecting,artery, and pressure forceijs; toothed forceps (Liston’s artery forceps without the catch answer the pur])Ose); sharp hook; blunt liook ; sci.ssors ; ^needles ; tracheotomy tubes and tapes. To these may be added a gag and tongue forceps, small wound retractors, and feathers to clear the tube when hrst introduced. A good tracheotomy tube should be of simple construc- tion, should be easy to introduce, should be as lai-ge as the diameter of the trachea will admit, should lie exactly in the long axis of the windpipe without touching the tracheal wall with its extremity, should have a movable shield so that it is disturbed as little as po.ssible, and the inner cannula should be capable of being easily inserted and removed.

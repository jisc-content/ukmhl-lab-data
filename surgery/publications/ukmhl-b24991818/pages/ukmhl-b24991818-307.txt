291 CHAPTER II. Excisiox OP THE Thyroid Body. Complete Excision.—This term is used in an elastic manner—for complete excision in the sense of removing the whole of both lobes and the isthmus should never be performed, because of the great risk of the gradual develop- ment of a “ cachexia strumipriva.” This condition resembles myxeedema, and is inevitably fatal in its ending. Hence, some portion of the thyroid gland should always be left behind ; it will liypertrophy, and prevent this unfortunate result of the excision. The method of operating here de- scribed is that known as Kocher’g. The patient lies upon the right-hand side of the table, with the shoulders well raised and the head extended over a large sand-bag or hard cushion. The chin should be kept in almewith the sternal notch, and the head be well fixed. An incision is made in the median line from the sternal notch to the upper limit of the bronchocele. From this point two lateral incisions are made upwards and outwards, one on each side. They are directed towards a point a little below the angle of the jaw, and when the cutaneous cut is complete it will have the outline of the letter Y. If the tumour be much more extensively developed on one side than on the other, the upper or oblique incision may be limited to the affected side. In any case the incision must not be spared. A primary requirement is that the tumour be very freely exposed. The lateral or oblique cuts will usually pass over the anterior borders of the sterno-mastoid muscles. The 2'>latysma and fascia are divided. Any veins which are met with are secured between two ligatures of catgut, and divided. The sterno-hyoid and stefno-thyroid muscles

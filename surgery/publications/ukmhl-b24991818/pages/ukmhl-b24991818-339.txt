CHAP, m.] OOPHORECTOMY. 323 The ovary is now drawn out of the abdomen by the two fingers, which retain the same foreeps-blade attitude. It is then handed over to an assistant, who holds it well away from the abdominal wall. The sm’geon displays the pedicle, carefully and completely divides the pei’itoneum with a fine knife, and ligatures the structures exposed in the manner already described. Three silk ligatures are employed, one for the tube, one for the vessels, and one for the ovarian ligaments and remaining structures. It often happens, even when no adhesions exist, that there is some difficulty in dragging the ovary well out of the wound. This is notably so when there is a thick layer of fat upon the abdominal parietes. In such cases much strain falls upon the broad ligament, and the surgeon’s fingers alone are not sufficient to hold the parts in place. In these instances it is necessary that the appendages should be seized by large-elbowed pressure-forceps. The pedicle in this operation is secured in precisely the same way as in ovariotomy (page 320). Silk of medium thickness is commonly used, but kangaroo tendon answers admirably. The parts are cut away close to the retaining fingers or the retaining forceps, and at least a third of an inch from the ligature. Before the division is made, it is well to fix one or possibly two pairs of artery forceps upon that part of the pedicle which lies between the ligature and the intended line of section. When the division is made, the forceps— which inflict no damage upon the part—prevent the stump from falling at once back into the pelvis, and allow it to be examined at leisure, and to be drawn forth should further ligature be needed. The wound is closed, and is dressed in the usual way.

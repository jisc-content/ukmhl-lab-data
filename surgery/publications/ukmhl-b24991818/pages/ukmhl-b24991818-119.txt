CHAP. IV.] AMPUTATIONS. 103 The deep palmax’ arch and the greater part of the superficial arch are, of course, removed with the hand. 3. By a L<oug Pnlniai* Flap. —The flap i.s U-shaped. It commences half an inch below the radial styloid process, and ends half an inch below the tip of the corresponding process of the ulna. The outer limb is directed towards the gap be- tween the index and middle fingers, the inner limb towards the web between the little and ring fingers. The almost trans- verse extremity of the flap reaches nearly to the middle of the metacarpus. Its general outline is shown in Fig. 34. The dorsal incision is carried straight across the back of the limb from one extiemity of the palmar flap to the other. It will therefore cross the Fig. .34.—disarticulation of thf. wri.st carpus. BY long palmar flap. A stout knife with a blade some three inches in length is required. The operator grasps the patient’s hand and holds it in the position of extension and supination. Entering the knife half an inch below the styloid process to his left, he carries it across the palm, in the direction indicated, to the corresponding point on the other side of the hand, and thus marks out the palmar flap.

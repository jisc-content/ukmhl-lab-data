443 Part XI. OPERATIONS ON THE SCROTUM AND PENIS. CHAPTER I. Operative Treatment of Varicocele. Tlic Operation.—The operator stands on the left side, one assistant raises and steadies the cord by holding the testis with his fingers from below, whilst another sponges. An incision is made, one and a half inches long, parallel to and directly over the cord, immediately below the external ring. The cut divides skin, connective and fatty tissue, the intercolumnar fascia, and the cremasteric layer. The latter is easily recognised by its longitudinal muscle bands. The edges of this fascia are then held aside by Wells’s forceps, and the anterior bundle of veins comes into view covered by the thin infundibuliform fascia. The latter is then carefully divided and peeled off with forceps^ so that an aneurysm needle can be introduced under the veins, but in front of the vas deferens. The veins must be perfectly bared, and cleanly exposed. It must be ascer- tained for certain that the vas and the vessels which lie behind it are not included. A catgut ligature of medium thickness is then drawn under the anterior bundle, which is cleared of surrounding tissues for a distance of about two inches. If it is desired that the lower part of the veins should be ligatured rather than the upper, they can be easily reached by making traction on the cord. A second ligature is introduced, and the veins are then ligatured in two places, about one inch and a half apart. The lower ligature should be tied first. The vessels so isolated are divided with scissors close to the ligatures and removed.

118 CHAPTER VIII. Disarticulation" at tub ShouldeR'Joint. iVIetliods of Coiitroiiiiig' IIa;inoi'rliag:c diiriiig^ llic Operation.—1. The method of controlling bleeding by means of an elastic band, which is carried across the axilla and brought well up over the point of the shoulder, is strongly to be condemned as useless and dangei’ous. In such a method the axillary artery is compressed mainly against the humerus. At the moment of the disarticulation the band is apt to slip. It is in the way of the operator, and cannot with any ingenuity be made trustworthy, 2. The compression of the subclavian artery in the neck against the first rib is a more certain mode of controlling bleeding. The vessel is compressed with the fingers or with an instrument shaped like the handle of a door-key. Except under special circumstances, compression of the subclavian is not to be advised. Even with a skilled and careful assistant the method is not absolutely trustworthy. The fingei’s are apt to slip during the movements of the limb or of the patient, and the assistant who controls the artery is somewhat in the way. The methods that are the most valuable are the two next described. 3. The main artery may be coinpi’essed in the flap by the fingers of an assistant, who takes hold of the part immediately before the vessel is divided. This procedure is described in the account of Spence’s operation. 4. The artery may be exposed and ligatured before it is divided, and early in the course of the operation. Although

<31 SUnaiCAL 01>E RAT IONS. [paut ii. In any caso the operator must be prepared to make a very free wound. Each portion of the exposed nerve should be freed for some distance respectively upwards and downwards, and the ends carefully drawn up in order, to bring as much of the nerve as possible into the wound area to overcome the gap resulting from retraction, and to allow the extremities to be brought readily into contact. The two exposed ends are excised. This is best done with sharp small scissors. The cut must be clean and quite transverse. The bulb may be cut away layer by layer until a section of healthy nerve fibres is exposed. It is not always necessary to remove the whole of the bulbous end. Indeed, the firmer tissues of the bulb afford an excellent hold for the sutures. The two ends are united by sutures. From 2 to 6 or 8 sutures will be required, according to the size of the divided nerve. The material should be either fine silk or kangaroo tendon. The thread is passed by means of a curved needle. A small “Intestinal ” needle answers admirably. The needle should be introduced about a quarter of an inch from the free end of the nerve, and the thread should be carried through the whole thickness of the trunk. All rough handling of the nerve must be avoided. Finally, the wound is closed.

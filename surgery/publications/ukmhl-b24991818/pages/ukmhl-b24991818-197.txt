CHAP. XVT.] 181 AMPUTATIONS. A- 2. Faraboiif’s iiiodificatiou oT fJardoii’s procedure.—This is practically a new operation. The femur is divided at the same level, but different ffaps are cut. The anterior flap exceeds in length the antero- posterior diameter of the limb at the saw-line by about an inch. The posterior flap is equal to half that diameter. The lateral incisions which mark out the anterior flap commence just below the joint-line (Fig. 63). The outer cut descends on the fibula, the inner is placed about two inches behind the inner edge of the tibia. The anterior" flap, therefore, will occupy more than half the circumference of the limb. The steps of the operation are precisely the same as in Carden’s method. An excellent stump is provided. The cicati'ix in all these opera- tions is found upon the posterior aspect of the liml.\ We append a brief description of ainpiitatioii ju!st above the «■ o II d y I e s.—Stokes’s Modification of Gritti's Method.—In this opera- tion the'patella is retained, excej^t its articular surface, the bone being intended to unite with the cut surface of the femur. The latter a finger’s breadth, at least half-an-inch limit of the condyles. An oval anterior flap is made which commences at the upper and posterior angle of the condyles, and reaches to the level of the tubercle of the tibia. The skin and fascia being slightly reflected, the ligamentum patelhe and capstde are cut across and the flap turned upwai’ds. Grasping the patella between fingers and thumb the surgeon cuts a groove for the saw all round the patella, and with a Fig. 63.—F.VEAHEur’s aji- PUTATION THUODOH THE CONDYLES OK THE FEMCR.

AMPUTATIONS. CHAP. II.] 87 carry tlie incision to the bone throughout, and dissect up the flap so freed, including in it everything down to the bone. Let the patient’s finger be now flexed, and make the dorsal incision. This incision is carried transversely across the finger at the level of the base of the distal phalanx, lletract the soft parts a little and open the joint. Divide the lateral ligaments. Nothing now connects the phalanx with the rest of the finger but the flexor profundus tendon and the glenoid ligament. Put the terminal phalan.x in the position of extreme extension, and divide these two structures by cutting from below up against the base of that phalanx. '2. By Unequal Dorsal ami Palmar Flaps.—Illustrated by disarticulation at the first interphalangeal joint. The palmar flap should exceed a little in length the diameter of the digit at the joint-line. The dorsal flap is one-third the length of the palmar. Ascertain the line of the articulation. Hold the finger in the position of pronation, and mark out the flaps by skin incisions. The flaps should be squarely cut. The lateral incisions should be placed midway between the dorsal and palmar surfaces, and should be commenced just above the joint-line. Carry the lateral cuts to the bone. Flex the linger strongly and carry the dorsal incision to the bone. Dissect up the dorsal flap, including in it all the soft parts to the bone. Open the joint from the dorsal aspect. Dissect up the palmar flap, dividing the flexor tendon at the end of the flap while the finger is in the extended position. This flap also includes all the soft parts to the bone. When the joint is reached, divide the lateral ligaments.

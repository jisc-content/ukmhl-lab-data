397 CHAP. XII.] ABDOMINAL NEPHRECTOMY. commenced just below the margin of the ribs. The centre of the incision will probably be about the level of the umbilicus. The abdomen is opened, the cut peritoneum on either side is picked up with pressure forceps, and when all bleeding has been checked the hand is introduced. The following are now the steps of the operation :— A. Examination of the opposite kidney. B. Establishment of the coder dam. c. Isolation and separation of the kidney. D. Isolation of the pedicle and demonstration of its component parts. E. Ligature of the pedicle. F. Removal of the kidney. G. Disposal of the ureter. A. As a first measure the hand is passed across to the opposite side of tlie body, and the opposite kidney carefully examined. If this organ be found to be extensively diseased, or if it be discovered that the patient has but one kidney, then the nephrectomy must needs be at once abandoned. The kidney on the affected side is now examined, its size is estimated, its general characters as regards mobility, consistence, etc., are ascertained, and the condition of its pedicle is demonstrated. The small intestines are kept aside by slightly tilting the body to the opposite side. The colon is made out, and is pushed towards the median line. The surgeon, then incises the outer layer of the mesocolon vertically over the renal region. Into the rent thus made the fingers are introduced, and the kidney is laid bare. B. Pressure forceps are made to grip the peritoneum on each side of this rent in the mesocolon. The forceps— some six on each side—are then lifted up and carry the two edges of the peritoneum with them, as one would lift up the mouth of a sac. The margins of the rent in the mesocolon are, indeed, drawn up until they reach the margins of the skin wound. The kidney lies exposed at the bottom of the peritoneal bag thus produced. It is within

AMPUTATIONS. 155 CHAP. XIII. J cut. In some text-books it is advised that the incision be carried from the tip of the outer malleolus to a point half an inch behind and below the inner malleolus. If this be done, there is great probability that the posterior tibial artery will be divided before its bifurcation, and the main artery of the flap (the internal calcaneal of the external plantar) be thus lost. If the flap be too large, there is great difficulty in dis- secting it back, and it will probably be dangerously scored and bruised in the attempt. 2. In clearing the os calcis, the periosteum may be at the same time peeled off—as many advise—and so made to form an important constituent of the heel flap. In young subjects (under the age of fourteen years) the posterior epiphysis of the os calcis may be detached and left un- disturbed in the flap. In such subjects it generally comes away during the process of clearing the os calcis. In still younger patients— say those under ten—the superficial parts of the os calcis will be found imperfectly ossified, and chunks of the soft bone may be cut away in a too vigorous clearing of the heel flap. 3. It is desirable that all the articular surface of the tibia should be removed, and, as the under surface of the bone is much domed, the section must be made as high up as a quarter of an inch to quite clear the summit of the concavity. In young patients the whole of the lower epiphysis may be removed by a too liberal use of the saw ; the measurement (quarter of an inch) refers to adults. n.—INTRACALCANEAL AMPUTATION OF THE FOOT. Pil'ogoir’s Operation.—This operation closely re- sembles Syme’s, save that the os calcis is sawn through and its hinder part is left in the heel flap. The lower ends of the tibia and fibula are sawn through, and to this cut surface of bone the surface of the divided os calcis is adjusted. The operatiofl usually described is a modification of Pirogoff’s oilginal procedure. Pirogoff divided the cal-

CHAP. X.] PY LORO-PLASTY. A double I'ow of stitches is next applied, the deeper sutures (which may well be continuous) going tlirough . mucous membrane and submucous tissue, ^ the more superficial being the usual interrupted Lembert’s stitches, which involve the serous and muscular coats. The hooks being withdrawn, an extra stitch is applied at either end, and the operation is completed by careful cleansing of the peritoneal sur- face of the pylorus and closure of the abdominal wound. The method will be readily under- stood by I’eference to Fig. 106. It has been largely employed for cicatricial stenosis following ulcer of the stomach, and occasionally when an active ulcer has been excised from the duodenum or pylorus with the view of prevent- ing subsequent stricture. Pyloro- plasty displaced stretching with the finger (Loreta’s operation), and is certainly safer and more efficient, but on the permanency of its results much doubt has been thrown, since many cases of pyloric stricture in which it has been j^erformed have required subsequent gastro - jejunostomy, although the patients were re- lieved for a time. It is easy to see why the operation may fail in its object, since the siu’geon actually increases the amount of scar tissue; furthei’, the cicatrix left by an ulcer of the pylorus is rarely a perfect ring, and the operation is useless for broad, irregular scars. Fig. 106.—THE THREE STAGES OF PYLOUO-PLASTY. The upper figure shows the incision through constricted portion (b) from stomach (.v) to duodenum (c). In the middle figure the wound is held open with hooks so as to become lozenge shaped. In the lower figui-e it is again converted into a linear wound anil sutured up in the form shown.

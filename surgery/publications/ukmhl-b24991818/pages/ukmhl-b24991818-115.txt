99 CHAPTER IV. Disarticulation at the Wrist-Joint. Iiistriiiiiciits.—A narrow amputating-knife, witli a stout handle and a blade from three to four inches in length. A scalpel. Dissecting and artery forceps, scissors, needles, etc. Position.—The surgeon sits facing the patient’s fore- arm, which is abducted horizontally and with the hand pronated. An assistant stands facing the operator, and with his back to the patient’s shoulder. He steadies the limb, draws up the soft parts, and takes charge of the flaps as they are formed. He can also manipulate the hand if required. A second assistant may conveniently attend to the sponging. The following methods of disarticulating will be de- scribed :— 1. Circular. 2. By elliptical incision. 3. By long palmar flap. 1. Tlie Circiilsir Method.—The circular incision is some way below the joint, and is inclined a little lower down upon the radial than upon the ulnar side, in order that the outer styloid process may be well cleared. The incision on the inner side is just above the base of the fifth metacarpal bone, while on the outer side it crosses the first metacarpal about 1 cm. below the earpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb (Fig. 33, a). The surgeon, holding the patient’s hand in his left hand, makes the circular incision, commencing it ujaon the dorsum, and turning the hand from the prone ta the supine position as the knife travels round the limb.

[PAET IV. SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 226 The centre of the incision should correspond to the tip or summit of the olecranon, so that two inches of the cut will be over the humerus and two inches over the oleci-ahon and ulna. The stout short-bladed excision knife may be carried at once down to the bones, cutting on to the olecranon, bisecting the triceps tendon, opening the articulation tln-ough the posterior ligament, and reaching the back of the humerus. As the cut will be made from “above downwards,” it will be seen that in the position occupied by the limb the knife will cut first upon the ulna, which is uppermost, and then upon the humerus. (6) Clearing of the Olecranon and the Condyles of the Humerus. —In clearing the bones for ex- cision, the following rules should be observed :—(1) The surgeon should keep the knife well down upon the bone, and his incisions should be short and made with force, and the edge of the blade be kept turned towards the bones. (2) The periosteum should be separated to as great an extent as is possible, and all ligamentous connections should be spared. The operator should aim at leaving the bones absolutely bare. (3) The rugine and the elevator should be freely used, while the knife is employed sparingly. The left thumb-nail must be used with vigour to retract the tissues as soon as they are separated, and the surgeon may expect that the thumb of his left hand will remind him of the operation for many days after. Good retractors must also be employed at every step. The main feature of the operation is the efficient peeling of the olecranon and the irregularly-shaped humei’us. Fig. 77.—EXCISION OF THE ELBOW.

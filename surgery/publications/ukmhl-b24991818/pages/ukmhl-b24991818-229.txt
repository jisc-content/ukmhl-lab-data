213 CHAPTER IV. Cuneiform Osteotomy for Inveterate Club-Foot. In this operation a wedge-shaped piece of bone is removed from the outer side of the foot at the site of the medio- tarsal joint. Si*e of tlic Wcdg-e.—The dimensions of the por- tion of bone removed must of necessity depend upon the degree of the deformity. In talipes equino-varus the base of the wedge is at the outer side of the foot, and is mainly represented by the cuboid; the apex will be at the scaphoid bone, the distal side of the wedge will be represented by a line at right angles to the metatarsal bones, and the proximal side by a line at right angles to the long axis of the os calcis. An important addition to the removal of the wedge con- sists in a simple division of the neck of the astragalus, performed through a separate incision on the inner side of the latter. Pei'fect position of the foot can be secured by this combined operation. In some instances the wedge is composed of jJortions of the astragalus, os calcis, scaphoid, and cuboid—the last- named bone predominating. In rarer cases it is found to contain portions of every one of the tarsal bones and the bases of the four outer metatarsal bones also. Operation for Talipes Tqiiino-Variis.—The patient is placed upon the back, with the hip and knee a little flexed, and the sole of the foot resting upon a sand pillow on tlie table. The surgeon stands to the outer side of the limb, and an assistant opposite to him grasps the foot and leg, and steadies the extremity or moves it as required. The operation is usually canled out as follows :— The outer surface of the foot having been well exposed.

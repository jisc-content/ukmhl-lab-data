CHAP. II.] AMPUTATIONS. 91 («) By a racket incision, with the vertical cut placed upon the side of the digit nearest to the ring-finger, and with the incision carried a little farther on the ulnar than on the radial side of the finger. (h) By unequal lateral flaps, the internal being the larger. (c) By the interno-palmar flap of Farabeuf. It corre- sponds to the flap already described as employed for the index finger, with the necessary difference that the position of the incisions is transposed. C'oiiiiiient.—In all these disarticulations the head of the metacarpal bone should be spared whenever possible. Of the two operations first described, the better is un- doubtedly that by the racket incision. The operation by lateral flaps has the drawback that the cicatrix is carried into the palm, the tissues of which are opened up. The method by means of a circular incision at the level of the web, with a median dorsal cut, affords a most excellent covering to the bone, but it provides a some- what clumsy stump. AMPUTATIONS AND DISARTICULATIONS OP THE THUMB. In performing an operation through the first or the second phalanx, or in disarticulating at the interphalangeal joint, one or other of the methods already described may be employed. The two most suitable operations are the following : — 1. By llie Racket Iiicisioii.—The incision commences upon the dorsum, opposite the neck of the metacarpal bone, and is continued down along the line of the extensor tendon until the base of the first phalanx is passed. Here the incision divides to form the oval, the palmar cut crossing the thumb transversely about opposite to the centre of the shaft of the phalanx. The steps of the operation have been already described. Disarticulation may be effected from the dorsum. The two e.xtensor tendons are divided opposite to the

CHAP. III.J 97 AMPUTATIONS. One of- the two following methods may be employed :— 1. The Racket Method.—The hand is to be held in the mid-position between pronation and supination. The widst is .steadied by an assistant while the surgeon holds the thumb. The dorsal incision commences in the tabatiere, just above the carpo-metacarpal joint, and on the tendon of the extensor primi internodii Ijollicis. It runs along the dorsum of the thumb, keeping nearer to the extei’iial than the internal border of the metacarpal bone. The oval encircles the head of that bone and crosses the 23almar asj^ect of the digit on a level with the free edge of the web as displayed when the thumb is abducted (Fig. 32). The procedure is practic- ally the same as that already described for the fingers. The sheath of the fiexor tendon may be closed. The arteria princeps pollicis, or its two collateral branches, will be found divided on the palmar aspect of the wound, and will require a ligature. The vessel runs along the palmar side of the metacarpal bone, and bifurcates between tlie heads of the flexor brevis and under cover of the long flexor.

By Palmar Flap.—This operation may be rapidly performed, but it is decidedly inferior to the method just described. K

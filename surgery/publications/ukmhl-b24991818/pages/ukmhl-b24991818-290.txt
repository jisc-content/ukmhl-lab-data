274 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part VI. In ordÂ«r to avoid the notching whicli not unfrequently occurs in the median line, when cicatrisation has taken place after this operation, thick flaps with square ends may be cut from each margin of the main cleft. These flaps have tlieir attached ends downwards. They are united to the raw margins of the central segment above, and to one another along, what is now the new margin of the lip. The segments of the lip will need to be freed from their deep connections on each side of tlie cleft. When the pre-maxillary bone projects strongly forward some surgeons remove it entirely, but the b'est coui-se is to retain it. Very usually the bending back of the bone is resisted by the cartilaginous vomer of children, and the elasticity of that structure causes the fragment to be again protruded when the pressure is removed. In such a case a portion of the vomer may be excised subjoeriosteally. An incision is made along the free border of the septum, leaving its arteries intact : the periosteum and mucous membrane are then elevated on either side, and a triangular segment is excised from the vomer. The os incisivum iiiay now be pushed into place, and may be retained, if needed, by one or more sutures. The bleeding in this operation is apt to be free, unless the subperiosteal method be closely adhered to.

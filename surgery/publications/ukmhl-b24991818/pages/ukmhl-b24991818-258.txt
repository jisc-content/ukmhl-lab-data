242 SURGICAL OPERATIONS. [part iv. been clesci’ibed and adopted, this appears to have substantial claims to be regarded as the most suitable. Position.—Tlie patient lies upon the back, with the limb close to the margin of the table. The lower part of the leg should project a little beyond the table, so that when the knee is bent at a right angle the foot may be able to rest, flat upon the sole, upon the end of the table. The surgeon stands upon the side to be operated on. Some surgeons prefer to stand upon the left side of the limb in the case of either extremity, a position which is certainly more convenient for sawing. One assistant places himself .opposite to the surgeon, and steadies the limb by the thigh. Another assistant hear the foot of the table holds the leg, and manipulates it as required. A third assistant by the surgeon’s side attends to the sponging, etc. At the commencement of the operation the limb is held with the knee a little flexed. Later, the joint is bent at a right angle. (1) The Skin Incision.—A curved incision, convex downwards, is made across the front of the knee below the patella. The incision commences and terminates at the posterior margin of one of the femoral condyles, whilst its lowest pomt in front corresponds with the insertion of the patellar ligament. During the making of this wound the knee-joint is held a little flexed, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues are alone divided at the first sweep of the knife. (2) Dividing of the Ligaments.—The knee is now flexed a little more, and with another sweep of the knife the anterior part of the capsule and the patellar ligament ai’e cut through, and the joint opened below the knee- cap. The patella, with its attached aponeurosis, is turned upwards, the joint is still more flexed, and the surgeon proceeds to divide in order the latei’al and the two crucial ligaments. (;l) Sawing of the Femur.—The joint is now bent at a

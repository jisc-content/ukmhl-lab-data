438 CHAPTER m. Operative Treatment op Stricture op the Urethra. INTERNAL URETHROTOMY. A GREAT variety of urethrotomes have been clevi.sed, but Teevan’s modification of Maisonneuve’s instrument is perhaps the best. In this the knife-blade is made to divide the stricture from in front, Teevan’s improvement consisting in a guide bougie of fine calibre, which is screwed on to the end of the urethi’otome, and is passed on into the bladder. Before use, the instrument should be carefully examined, so as to avoid the risk of the bougie breaking off, etc. The guide bougie must be flexible, and yet with sufficient rigidity to enable the stricture to be passed. The urethral canal is straightened by the surgeon making traction with the left hand whilst the bougie is in- troduced. If the stricture be very tight, the instrument is apt to double back, in which case another bougie should be tried. As soon as there is no doubt it has entei’ed the bladder, the urethrotome is screwed on to the bougie, and both are well oiled, the instrument being then passed onwards until the knob of the urethrotome presses against the stricture. The urethrotome is depres.sed so that its handle lies between the patient’s thighs. The knife-blade is then made to protrude one or two millimetres from its guard, and the stricture divided on either side of the median line. After each cut of the knife, the latter is withdrawn within its guard. When it is thought that the stricture is sufficiently cut, the urethrotome and guide are withdrawn, and a large-sized Lister’s metal sound is passed. It may be necessary to reinti’oduce the urethrotome and repeat the notching, and the surgeon should not be con- tent until a full-sized Lister’s sound or a bougie of the

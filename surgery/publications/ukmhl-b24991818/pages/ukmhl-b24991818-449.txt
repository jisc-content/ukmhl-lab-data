LATERAL LITHOTOMY. CHAP. I.] 433 withdraws the linger when the foi'cei^s are well in the bladder. The stone is seized and removed. The line of traction in removing the stone should be in the line of the outlet of the pelvis. When the body is in the lithotomy position, therefore, the forceps must be drawn in a direction upwards and forwards. The bladder is finally explored with the finger for other calculi or for fragments. If any debris remain, such as may be broken from a pho.sphatic calculus, the viscus is washed out with the syringe or irrigator. Lateral Litiiotoiiiy in Cliil<lreii.—The operation in children is much modified by the anatomical conditions of the 23arts. The j>elvis is relatively narrower than in the adult. The usual incisions are made ; the .staff is reached, and a relatively free incision is made into the neck of the bladder. The deep wound is examined with the finger. A pair of dressing forceps is then introduced along the staff into the bladder, and, by opening the blade.s, the wound in the vesical neck is cautiously enlarged. The forceps are removed, and a probe-pointed director or common jjrobe is then introduced into the bladder along the groove in the staff. The staff is withdrawn, but the probe or director is left in position, as a guide to the bladder, until the operation is comjjleted. The finger is now introduced along the slender probe, and is slowly and cautiously wormed into the bladder. The stone may now be removed l)y apjirofjriate forceps in the usual way, or its extraction may be effected by a scooj3 aided with the tip of the left forefinger, or the calculus may be worked out of the bladder by means of one forefinger introduced into that organ, and aided by the other forefinger inserted into the rectum.

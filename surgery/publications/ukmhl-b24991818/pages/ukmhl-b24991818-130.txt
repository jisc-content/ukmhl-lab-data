114 CHAPTER VII. Amputation op the Arm. Iiistriiiiionts.—An amputating-knife equal in length of blade to one and a half times the width of the limb for transfixion.

An amputating-saw. - Some seven or eight pressure forceps. Artery and dissecting forceps. Scissors, retractors, etc. Position.—The patient lies upon the back, and near to one or other edge of the table, according to the side of the amputation.

One assistant holds the hand and forearm, and manipu- lates the limb. A second stands above the surgeon, and attends to the retraction of the divided parts. A third assistant commands the main artery. The following two methods will be described. The first- named is considered to apply especially to the lower half of the arm, the second to the middle of the limb:— 1. The circular method. 2. By antero-posterior flaps. 1.

To effect this he passes his hand beneath the limb, and bending his wrist over the patient’s arm, he commences his incision with the heel of the knife, upon the surface of the limb nearest to himself

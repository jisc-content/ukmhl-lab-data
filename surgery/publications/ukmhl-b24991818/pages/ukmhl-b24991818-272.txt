256 CHAPTER XV. Excision op the Lower Jaw. A LARGE number of the operations are partial, and only in a few instances is it necessary to remove the entire bone —i.e. both the right and left portions of the maxilla. Iiisti'iinicnts Kcqiiirc<1.—The same as for excision of the upper jaw, with the addition of a small saw with a movable back, or a small Butcher’s saw, and a needle in a handle for securing the tongue if necessary. Removal of One Half of the Lower Jaw.— The patient lies upon the back, with the head and shoulders raised, and with the trunk close to the edge of the table. The surgeon stands on the sid^ to be operated upon. Some find it more convenient to stand on the patient’s right in dealing with either side of the maxilla. The head is turned to the sound side. The chief assist- ant takes his place opposite to the surgeon. A second helper stands by the operator’s side. In male subjects the chin will have been already shaved. 1. A vertical incision is made through the tissues of the chin, in the middle line, starting just below the lip, which is not divided. From the lower end of this another incision is carried along and just below the infei’ior boi’der of the jaw for its entire length, and is then directed up- wards along the posterior margin of the ascending ramus, to end opposite to the lobule of the ear (Fig. 83, c). The incision is carried throughout down to the bone, except in one place—viz. where the knife crosses the facial artery. Here the wound is only skin deep. After the incision has been made, the surgeon returns to the spot indicated, exposes the facial artery by dissection, secures it between two ligatures, and divides it.

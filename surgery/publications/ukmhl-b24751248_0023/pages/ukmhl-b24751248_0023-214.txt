186 IIEPOIIT ON SUUGEIIY. the Bcapvila for the purpose of exposing tutnours. (4) A similar operation on tlie storniun. (<;) Instead of the removal of the zygomatic arch, as performed by Langenbeck ('Year-book,' 1862, p. 271), an osteoplastic resection. As oxnmplos of the transplantation of adjacent yet adhering portions of bone, he gives uranoplasty by bone, an operation proposed by Diefl'enbach, and ])erformcd by W utzer, Biihring, and others; Pirogolf's amputation of the foot, and the similar operations on the knee and elbow, proposed by G ritti and Szymanowsky; rhinoplasty, as performed by Oilier, in 1861 ; the cure of pseudarthrosis by transplanting into the intermediate space a piece of bone i)artially separated from one of the fractured ends, an operation Avhich has not been attempted on the living. He concludes with a short account of osteotomy, and an enumeration of the cases hitherto recorded. R. Volkmann points out that there are reasons for doubting the per- manency of the new bony layers formed by means of periosteal osteo- plasty ('Detitsche Klin.,' 1863, p. 204). The new bone formed in fractures, in stumps, iu carious and anchylosed bones, is generally again absorbed after a time, and there is too much reason to fear that the bone formed by means of the transplantation of periosteum, as in uranoplasty and rhinoplasty, will suft'er the same fate.

In the treatment of delirium tremens, after injuries, "W. Eoser (' Arch, d. Heilk.,'and ' Arch, flir Klin. Chir.,' iii, Gurlt's report, 219) re- commends, as a vital indication, the most energetic administration of opium ; for example, two grains of morphia at once, and a grain every hour after, till the pupils become much contracted and the respirations diminish to 10, 8, or even 6 in the minute. Tlio appearance of a patient so narcotized is alarming, but the result soon shows that the deep nar- cotization has its use; the patient becomes quiet, he sleeps a deep sleep, from which he awakes free from delirium; should a recurrence appear, no difficulty will be found in its management.

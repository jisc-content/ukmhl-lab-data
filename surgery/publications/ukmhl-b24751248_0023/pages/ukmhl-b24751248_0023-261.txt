He then proceeded to ex- amine the dill'ereut methods of reduction; he found blows on the cheeks useless; pressure with the thumbs on the back-teeth, combined with elevation of the chin, only succeeded a few times; depression of the chin, at the same time that the thumbs pressed away the masseters from the interior of tlie mouth was rather more successful; depression of the eliin and pressure 0]i the coronoid processes from before backwards^ with the thumbs in the mouth, effected reduction constantly and with ease. Sucli a method also appears most rational, for the pressure on the coronoid processes is transmitted directly to the condyles, and the ligaments, which form the principal impediment, are previously relaxed as much as possible by the depression of the chin.

Holt has found extension by straps of plaster and a weight to give most satisfactory results in cases of excision of the head of the femur. He adopted a similar plan in a case in which he had excised the elbow by a single longitudinal incision ('Lane.,' 1863, i, 38). " After the operation the limb was extended in the following manner :— A long strip of plaster was carried up on each side of the forearm, leaving a loop beyond the hand, and a piece of stick being inserted in the loop, so as to prevent the hand from being compressed; a bag of sand of three pounds weight was attached to the stick, so as to keep the arm on the stretch and the cut ends of the bones apart. As the patient complained after a day or two of the drag on the shoulder, a

273 CA.XCKll 01'' THE LIP. Predisposing causes.—(a) Sex.—It has long been noticed that cancer of the lips principally occurs in the male sex. In different regions women form from one twentieth to one fifth of the cases, as is shown in the following list:—Lebert (Paris), 15 males, 3 females (' Tr. d. Mai. Cane.'). Gault, ao males, i female. Bertin (Montpellier), 24 males, 3 females. Meker (Laibacli), 127 males, i_5 females ('Jenaische Ann.,' 1850, ii, 480). Heurtaux (Paris), 69 males, 10 females ('These, du Cancroide,' Paris, J 860). Bruns (Tubingen), 50 males, 5 females ('Handb. d. Chir.,' 18^9, ii, _53j). Barrier ('Gaz. Med.de Lyon,' 1852, and by letter) observed 71 cases, from iS^o-j;^, 6a males and 9 females; in 1^9 cases the lower and in 12 the upper lip was affected; of the latter, 6 were males, and 6 females. In 181 cases collected by Des- granges ('Gaz. Hebd.,' 18^4) there were 158 males, 23 females; tlie l^art affected was in 169 the lower, in 22 the npper lip, and in 6 the angle of the mouth. All these cases together give 527 males, 69 females, or a ratio of 7,^0 to i. (d) In 2 52 cases, only one occurred under the age of twenty,—in a girl of sixteen. Prom the thirtieth year the disease increases in fre- quency up to extreme old age, the number of the cases being compared with the number of those living at each particular age. Of cour.se the absolute number of cases diminishes in proportion to the advance in years, for at the age of 60 there remains only a fifth, at 70 an eighth, at 75 a twelfth, at 85 a ninety-third part of those born; the very aged, besides, rarely agree to an operation. Lebert found in 17 cases of cancer of the lip 2 aged from 30 to 35, I from 35 to 40, 2 from 40 to 4J, 7 from 45 to 50, a from 50 to 55, 3 from 60 to 65 years. Bruns found that the disease commenced in his 55 cases in a between 20 to 30, in 9 from 30 to 40, in 11 from 40 to 50, in 13 from 50 to 60, in 15 from 60 to 70, and in 5 from 70 to 80 years. (c) Temperament, occupation.—Dr. Lortet believes that the san- guine temperament predisposes to this disease. Most of the cases seen by him were blonds, with red faces and fully developed capillary circu- lation. Both Lortet and Bruns agree in considering the disease more frequent in those residing in the country. In 181 cases collected by Lortet there \yere 107 countrymen, la weavers, 4 gentlemen, 4 masons, 4 shoemakers, and 4 joiners, 2 wheelwrights, a wood sawyers, a servants, and 19 without fixed occupation. The excessive amount of agi'iculturists does not in any way correspond to a predominance of the country population in the nine departments from which these patients were drawn. There M'ere 1,095,000 residents in the country out of a total population of 3,924,000, or rather more than a quarter, ' whilst the number of cases occurring in agriculturists is over five ninths. (n) Clinical and geographical conditions.—Heurtaux collected twelve cases of hereditary origin, to which Lortet is able to add four or five more, a number too small for any deduction. More abundant thou^li yet insufficient, are the materials for determining the geographi- cal distribution of the disease. 18

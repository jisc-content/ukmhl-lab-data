103 NERVOUS SYSTEM. applies ice in nii indian-rubber bag, about two inches wide, along that part of the spinal column containing the part of the cord on which he wishes to act. On the same principle, the vitality of the spinal cord may- be increased by applying liot water and ice alternately, each in an indian- rubber bag, if very energetic action be required ; if less vigorous action be necessary, he applies ice or iced water only, using it several times a day, for a short time on each occasion, with a long interval between each appli- cation. If it be desirable to increase the circulation in any given part of the body, tiiis can be effected by exerting a soothing, sedative, depressing, or paralysing influence (according to the amount of power required) over those ganglia of the sympathetic which send vaso-motor nerves to the part intended to be acted on. This influence may be excited by applying ice to the central part of the back, over a width of from four to four and a half inches, and extending longitudinally over the particular segments of the sympathetic and of the spinal cord on which it is desired to act. For example, intending to direct a fuller and more equable flow of blood to the brain, he applies ice to the back of the neck and between the sca- pular; increased circulation in and warmth of the upper extremities are induced in the same way; the thoracic and abdominal viscera can be influenced in like manner by applications to the dorsal and lumbar regions; while the legs and the coldest feet ever felt can have their circu- lation so increased that they become thoroughly warm by an ice-bag applied to the lower part of the back. By thus acting by means of cold or heat, or both alternately or combined, on the spinal cord and ganglia of the sympathetic. Chapman has succeeded in completely arresting the fits of many epileptics, and in curing the following maladies:—Paralysis; long-continued and extreme headaches; prolonged giddiness; extreme somnolence; a feeling of want of firmness in standing and of security in walking; habitual hallucinations; loss of memory; weakness and dim- ness of sio;ht; ocular spectra; inequality of the pupils ; lateral anaesthesia; uncontrollable spasmodic opening and shutting of the mouth ; cramps of the limbs (in two cases of the hands incapacitating the patients to con- tinue their work; numbness of the fingers, incapacitating the patients to pick up small objects or to use a needle ; paralysis of the bladder; incapa- city to retain the urine more than a few minutes; profuse and too frequent menstruation; scanty and irregular menstruation; extreme menstrual pains ; profuse leucorrhcea, with long-continued bearing down of the womb, and extreme pain of the back ; halntual constipation ; habi- tual diarrhoea; general coldness of the surface of the body, which has continued for many years ; habitually and hitherto irremediably cold feet. For the cure of epilepsy he gives the following rules, the object of which is to lessen the excito-motor power of the cord by lessening the amount of blood circulating in it, and to prevent those spasmodic contractions of the cerebral arteries which induce the sudden loss of consciousness constituting the first phase of an epileptic fit:—(i) Apply ice to some one part or to the whole lengtli of the back, and from two to eighteen hours a day, according to the special character of the case under treatment. (2) If the extremities be cold, to aid them in recovering their wonted warmth during the first day or two of treatment, by frequently immersing them in hot water, and by friction ; also in winter by clothing the arms down tq

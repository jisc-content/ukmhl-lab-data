The first case, a Mr. 0—, aged 26, after much mental anxiety and overwork, had an attack of hepatic colic. Scarcely recovered, he married, and went on a tour; on his return, Dr. Fletcher " found him sitting ujj, able to walk a short distance, and then failing, not for want of muscular power, but from the severe palpitations caused by the slightest motion or excitement.

IIEPOIIT ON MIDWIFKEY, ETC. 400 by the greater frequency of puerperal attacks among the latter, (e) The duration alternates between a few hours, and lo or 14 days; generally the longer it continues the stronger it becomes, presupposing that tlie patient continues well. (/) The course is almost always the same. It begins generally in the first 24 hours after birth, then becomes always more considerable, remains uniform for a time, and again gradually disappears. It often exists even very distinctly at the time when the milk-fever,—falsely so called,—is said to come on. (g) The duration of the labour seems to have no influence upon the development and the degree of this condition of the pulse; on the con- trary, the slightest pathological condition prevents its occurrence and removes it. It is observed after miscarriages, premature labour, and labour at the full time; and after natui'al and artificial delivery. Even violent after-pains do not remove it, but the same is not applicable to any but slight haemorrhages. (7i) Position has a marked effect, and a very considerable change occurs when the patient removes from the recumbent into the erect position, (i) This slowness of the pulse in- dicates a very favorable prognosis. It is only found with women in perfect health. In a hospital its frequent occurrence indicates an excellent state of health, while its rare occurrence should cause us to fear the appearance of diseases and epidemics. {¥) The cause of this slowness of the pulse does not lie in a nervous exhaustion :—the inves- tigations on the pulse which the author made in conjunction with Marcy, much more clearly point to its connection with an increase of the arterial tension after birth.

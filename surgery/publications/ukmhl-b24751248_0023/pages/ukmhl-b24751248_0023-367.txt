Dr. Steele.—' The Annual Medical Eeport of Guy's Hospital' for 1862, Contains a special account of the Lying-in Charity, of which the follow- ing is a summary (Mr. Doig, 'Med. Times and Graz.,' vol. i, p. 419, 1863) :—" The patients are attended by the pupils of the hospital, under the immediate superintendence of the two obstetric physicians. Two of the senior pupils are in constant residence for two months at a time, to keep the records and to attend cases of urgency, as weU as to direct the junior pupils in cases of doubt or difficulty. The records of this department of the hospital have been always carefully kept, and the small rate of mortality attending its operations is a sufficient criterion of its administrative success. The charity is entirely confined to the south side of the river, and embraces a densely populated neighbourhood of considerable extent. Taking the hospital as a centre, its radius extends two miles in every direction—from Lambeth Walk on the west to Rotherhithe on the east, while the High Street of the Borough forms the central line, and subdivides the area into two nearly equal parts."

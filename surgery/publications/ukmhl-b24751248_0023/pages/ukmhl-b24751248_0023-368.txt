Dr. S. Lawrence (Montrose), "A Statistical Eeport of One Thousand Midwifery Cases " (' Edinb. Med. Journ.,' February and March, 1863). The author insists on the importance of collecting accurate statistics of midwifery in private practice. In the above number are included all cases of birth occurring after the period of quickening, 32 children having been born abortive or premature, of whom 18 were dead and 14 living. Of the 1000 women, 220 were primiparae and 780 multipara3. The number of chOdren born was 1017 (there being 17 cases of twins), of whom 553 were males and 464 females. Five mothers died, and of these, 2 were previously in a feeble state of health. Of the children, 45 mature and immature were born dead. The number of tedious or difficult labours was 83. Delivery was accomplished by the forceps in 28 cases ; there were 34 cases of abnormal presentation, and labour was complicated in 21 cases. (i) Of the 83 tedious and difficult cases, 38 were primipara?, or i to 5 ; and 45 were multiparae, or i to 17. Feeble uterine action, or this with rigidity of the soft parts, occurred in about i of every 6 primi- parae, in I of every 21 multiparae. Of the 83 cases, delivery was ac- complished naturally—i. e. without either medicinal or mechanical aid— in 21; by the forceps in 28 ; ergot was given in 37 cases (always in the second stage, and in infusion) ; in 19 "with apparent benefit;" in 18 " with no perceptible effect;" in 5 cases the tincture of Indian hemp was given, by way of testing its powers as a uterine stimulant," in 2 cases "with seeming benefit, in 3 with none." (2) Of the 28 forceps cases,_ 21 were primiparas, or i to 10 ; and 7 were multipara), or i to 111. Of the mothers in these 28 cases, all recovered bvit one, who died from uterine phlebitis, after a very severe labour from contracted pelvis; in the great majority the recovery was as rapid as in ordinary cases.

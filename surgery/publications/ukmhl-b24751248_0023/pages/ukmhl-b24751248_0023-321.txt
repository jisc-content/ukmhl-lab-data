He considers that the history of the case, the suddenness of the attack, the frequent recurrence of the symptoms, or their supervention after the reduction of an external hernia, are but very uncertain signs of any particular form of strangulation. He calls attention to the serous exudation which often rapidly appears in acute internal strangulation, and relates a case where a very large amount of reddish serum was found; the bowel was strangulated in an abnormal aperture in the mesentery, and death had occurred forty-eight hours after the com- mencement of the disease. He considers the gurgling sound, which is often heard, a favorable symptom, as showing that the peristaltic in.otion of the bowel is still active. He quotes cases in wliicli this affection has been confounded witli strangulated hernia, with reducible hernia, with peritonitis, with biliary and renal colic, with poisoning,

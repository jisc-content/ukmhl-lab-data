UEPOllT ON SUllGEUy. these parts, the continuity of tlie bono being perfectly preserved, llecovery followed in the simplest way, and without the least disfigure- ment. If, on the other hand, the necrosis had extended as far as the external swelling appeared to indicate, and to more than the outer lamella,—if, moreover, its limits had not yet become distinct,—so as to necessitate the removal of tlie whole of that portion of the jaw, the next step would have been to detach the gum and periosteum from the inner surface as far as the lower margin of tiie bone, carrying the separation of the periosteum and muscular attachments up the ascending ramus, and then to saw through the bone anteriorly with the chain saw. The piece is then to be dragged forwards by means of forceps, any parts still adherent to be separated, and the ramus again divided, or exarticulation may be completed without difficulty. The whole half of the jaw can in this way be removed without any external incision, and without injury to the surrounding soft parts. This method of intrabuccal exarticulation and resection (Lai'ghi) is the very perfec- tion of operative surgery; it may also be applied to the upper jaw. Little or no deformity is caused by such an operation, for the soft parts remain after removal of the bone almost in their natural position. Un- fortunately such an operation is scarcely applicable to any but cases of necrosis ; in this affection it is indisputably indicated. The author is not in favour of delaying the operation very long, for the patient loses strength, and the necrosis spreads further and further. Among other interesting cases one is related of phosphorus disease, in which Pitha succeeded in removing the whole of both upper jaws, without making any external incision, and without producing any sub- sequent deformity.

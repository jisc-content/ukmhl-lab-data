It is certain that, if the suspected disease be present, it will increase, and no general treatment can be available. Are we to operate ? It is equally certain that no cure is to be found in removing the eyeball. The invariable result of such attempts has been recurrence of the disease locally, and there are always tumours of the brain or other vital organs, generally called secondary, but fre- quently incorrectly so. I'rom all that I have seen, and most cei'tainly when the optic nerve is involved, I fully believe that death has occurred sooner than if the disease had been left to run its course. There is not an unequivocal case of recovery on record. The hasty reports given in the journals a week or two after the operations as ' successful opera- tions for soft cancer of the eyeball—extirpation for cancer—cure,' and 80 forth, tend greatly to mislead the medical public. I am not now, be it remembered, discussing the question of operating for malignant affections in general; for I must say that iu some—hard cancer, for instance—I fully believe that, imder certain restrictions, life is pro- longed by it, that a part of the term to be lived is passed through with less suffering, and that hope, rather than despair, prevails. It is medullary cancer only of the eyeball that I am considering." J. W. Hulke, six cases of intraocular cancer (' Ophth. Hosp. Eep.,' iv, 81). Conjunctiva and cornea.—H.

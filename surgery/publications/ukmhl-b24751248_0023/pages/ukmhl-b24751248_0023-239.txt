211 EXPJilUMKNTS ON EMBOLISM. embolism,—tetfiuic spasms, paleness of the licad, luvokmtary passage ot the urine and tbces, very deep inspirations, &c.; death is probably caused in both cases by the ischsemia of the brain. He found tliat bodies, such as wax pellets, which exercised neither a mechanical nor chemical irritation, became encysted in the lung, without any further change in the pulmonary tissue; nor did they, when combined with. injection of putrid matters into the blood, excite lobular inflammation. Globules of quicksilver injected into the veins cause local inflammatory changes of the lung, as described by Gaspard and Cruveilhier; the inflammation is not, however, excited by the simple mechanical stop- page of the vessels, but by a specific action of the mercury on the sur- rounding pulmonary tissue. Emboli, composed of decomposing nitro- genous substances, excite inflammatory processes which may spread over large portions of the lung ; they commence, however, from the point at which the plug is arrested, and accordingly the tissues are most affected, even gangrenous, close to the embolus, while at a greater dis- tance resolution of the inflammation may take place. Perfectly fresh coagula of healthy blood, passing into the pulmonary artery, generally contract and disappear without producing any particular change in the tissue around them ; they occasionally under special conditions excite lobular processes: septic changes in the blood exercise no influence in deciding the effects of such fresh coagula. Pus causes no coagulation of blood contained in the veins of the living body, even after long contact. Both miliary tubercles and acute phthisis much resemble, and are possibly caused by coagula acting as emboli in the pulmonary vessels. The in- jection of wax pellets, of air, or of quicksilver into the vessels of various parts of the body produced very different effects according to the par- ticular arteries affected ; thus, (i) paralysis of the posterior part of the body and red softening of the lower half of the spinal cord in embolism of the coi-respondiug spinal arteries; (2) vomiting and diarrhoea, with enormous congestion of the portal vein, and the formation of ulcers in the stomach, which resembled the round gastric ulcer, and in the intes- tinal canal, affecting especially Peyer's glands, and resembling typhoid ulcerations—from embolism of the intestinal arteries ; (3) putrid changes in the blood in consequence of partial gangrenous destruction of the mucous membrane of the bowels caused by embolism of the intestinal arteries; (4) tetanus, ending in death within two hours, from embolism of the brain and medulla oblongata, unaccompanied by any noticeable change in the nervous tissue; (5) eczema of the lips, gums, and muzzle, indisputably from the embolism of air-vesicles in the corresponding ai-teries; (6) falling-ofl[' of the hair, probably; and (7) ecchymoses of the skin, as in morbus maculosus Werlhofii, undoubtedly from embolism of the arteries of the skin; (8) very violent rheumatic pains, gradually advancing muscular paralysis, and destruction of the muscular tissue, in consequence of the embolism of quicksilver into the muscular arteries and the chemical irritation exercised by the metal 011 the muscular substance; (9) albumen and blood in the urine, with patho- logical changes of the kidney, in embolism of the afferent vessels and Jlalpighian bodies ; (10) little extravasations from the portal vein, and the formation of solid bodies, spotted -with yellow and red, attaining

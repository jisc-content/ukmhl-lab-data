In a case of compound fracture of the leg with simple fracture of the corresponding thigh, Prof. Pitha determined on preserving the limb; chloroform having been administered, he covered the wound with a little charpie, and at once applied the splints. He strongly recommends such a plan of treatment; no time should be lost with cold lotions, ice, or leeches; the splints act as the best antiphlogistic, and at once relieve the pain of the injury (' AUg. "Wien. Med. Zeit.,' 1863, p. 237). Dr. Biederlack has somewhat modified an old method of applying counter-extension in fractures of the femur ('Deutsche Klin.,' 1862, p. 509). A well-padded girdle of leather or elastic material, from which on both sides thigh-straps pass round the inguinal and gluteal regions, as in a truss, is buckled round the hips. On each side of the girdle is a ring, through which a cord is passed, and then fastened to the side of the bedstead. The patient bears such a bandage very well, provided a thick layer of wadding is placed under the thigh-straps. H. Davies gives a description of Dr. Gordon Buck's extension appa- ratus, and of Dr. N. Smith's anterior splint, as employed in some of the American military hospitals for compound fractures of the femur from gunshot wounds (' Lane.,' 1863, i, 629). B. B. Miles records four cases of gunshot fractures of the femur, treated with Smith's anterior splint ('Amer. Med. Times,' 1863, ii, pp. 14, 26). E. G. "Waters records some cases of gunshot fractures of the thigh treated conservatively (ib., 1863, i, pp. I/O. 184). " The writer regrets that he is not able to give the exact number of amputations performed for this injury, but is able to state positively that only one patient recovered of the many who underwent the operation. In this case the operation was performed in the upper third of the thigh." There were three cases of resection of the femur, but " all died within a fortnight after the operation, and the autopsy in each case revealed the melancholy fact that nature had made no attempt at reparation." Three died out of fourteen cases, in which an attempt was made to save the limb; nine were discharged from hospital, already using their injured limbs in standing, and walkiag with considerable facility. " The remaining two of the fourteen con- tinue under treatment. One of them goes out daily on crutches, the

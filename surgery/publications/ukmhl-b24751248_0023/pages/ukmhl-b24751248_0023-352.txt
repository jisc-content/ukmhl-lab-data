IIEPOHT ON SUllGEUY. to its uoi'iiml position, a cure will, in nil probability, be secured by simple means, that is, by extension, and tliafc the operation of tenotomy may be set aside; but if much force is called for to bring about this result, the division of the contracted tendons should be performed. " The mechanical means which I have been in the habit of employiuf^ arc very simple, a good firm linen strapping being all that is required by way of material. The metliod of its application is alsQ very simple, and may be thus described. If the case be one of varus or equino- varus, a piece of strapping about one inch wide, broad enough to cover the body of the foot, and about nine inches long, should be selected, and fastened by at least one circular turn round the foot, leaving the end on its outer sidai; the foot is then to be brought to the requii-ed position, and fixed there by forcibly bringing the extremity of the plaster to the upper and outer part of the leg, using it as a side splint. This upper extremity is then to be firmly held in position by an assistant, whilst a second piece is applied round the foot and ankle as a figure of 8. By this turn the external upright plaster-splint is firmly compressed towards the leg, and thus drawing upon the ankle, turns the deformed foot firmly outwards, and fixes it in the required position. A third or circxilar piece may then be applied roimd the leg to fix the upper portion of the vertical plaster-splint, and the thing will be complete. " If these strappings be well applied, it will not be necessary to readjust them for at least three or four days; by such means a large proportion of cases will be readily and permanently cured. " The principle of its application rests in the extending force which is employed by the external or vertical portion ; the second or figure- of-8 binding this vertical splint firmly to the leg, increasing its extend- ing force and making it permanent."

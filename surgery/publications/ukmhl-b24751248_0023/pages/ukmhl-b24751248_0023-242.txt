Chir.,* iii, 169.)—"Whilst osteitis, iu a strict sense, or inflammation of the proper osseous tissue has been only recently proved to exist, it appears that the older surgeons recognised an inflammation of the vascular tissues in the centre of the long bones in opposition to perios- titis. They, however, studied it exclusively in connection with direct injuries of the medullary canal, especially comminuted fractures and amputations; and Chassaignac (18^3, 1859) was the first to accuratelv define and study anatomically and clinically the spontaneous or essential osteomyelitis, which occurs independently of any separation of continuity of the bones. In recent years, German writers have occupied them'- selves especially with inflammatory separation of the epiphysis, an affection which they considered identical with the osteomyelitis described by Chassaignac. The former affection is, however, by no means neces- sarily connected with inflammation of the medullary tissues, of which ' it forms an important, but only occasional, complication; thus, accord- ing to present experience, it occurs as a cousequence of periostiti,-; attacking the lower third of the femur in youthful individuals; 2, as a result of an acute inflammation of a joint in young persons ; 3, in con- nection with a circumscribed inflammation of tlie epiphysis ; and, 4, after either circumscribed or difluse osteomyelitis. It is of importance to separate the circumscribed from the difluse form of osteomyelitis, for the former, in connection with abscess of bone and tubercle, has been far better studied than the latter, is an essentially difterent disease from the one described by Chassaignac, is in respect to its development, course, and the participation of the rest of the organism a local aftection, which, diagnosed early, may end in j-ecovery, and in which the mortality from p^'iemia, septicemia, and

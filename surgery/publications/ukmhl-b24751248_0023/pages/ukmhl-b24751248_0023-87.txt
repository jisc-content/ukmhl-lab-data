NlillVOUS SYSTEM. 75 I wlicn the tinricles return from the state of diftstole to that of systole, one main reason would seem to be that tlieir walls fall in, in consequence of the blood being, as it were, suddenly sucked away from their cavities l)y the diastole of the ventricles; and thus the explanation of the rhythm of the whole heart is included in the explanation of the ryhthm of the ventricles, for the movements of the auricles resolve themselves into simple conse- quences of the movements of the ventricles. (6i) The fact that the heart beats more quickly when the medulla oblongata or pneumogastric nerves are acted upon hy feeble electric shocks may show, not an excited state of functional activity in the rhythmic nervous centres of the heart, but the very opposite, for it has been seen (v. 43) that the disposition to muscular contraction is inversely related to the amount of nervous in- fluence supplied to the muscles. (62) The fact that the heart pauses in the state of diastole when the medulla oblongata or pneumogastrics are acted upon by stronq electric shocks is readily explained by supposing that these shocks have paralysed the rhythmic nervous centres of the heart, and so left the muscular walls of this organ free to yield—(;) to the action of their natural electricity (which action antagonises contraction so long as it continues), (a) to the pressure of the stream of blood which is continually setting in from the valveless openings of the great veins. (6,3) The fact that the muscular coats of the ordinary vessels pass into a state of contraction when the vaso-motor nerves are exposed to the action of feeble electric shocks is in strict harmony with, and leads to th'6 same conclusion as, the fact that the heart exhibits an increased disposition to contraction under analogous circumstances (v. 61). (64) The fact that the muscular coats of the ordinary vessels pass into a state of relaxation ■when tlie vaso-motor nerves ai'e exposed to the action of strong electric shocks would also seem to be in strict harmony with, and to lead to the same conclusion as, the fact that the heai't pauses in the state of diastole under the same circumstances. (65) The fact that the muscular coats of the ordinary vessels pass into a state of relaxation when their special nerves are divided is also in harmony with the fact last mentioned, for it can be of no essential moment whether these coats be paralysed by the action of electricity upon their nerves, or by dividing these nerves. (66) The fact that a heart, or the fragment of a heart, may go on beating in the air after it is out of the body need lead to no different conclusion respect- ing the action of the heart; for in this case the explanation may be either— (i) that air which is not changed by the respiration of the tissues may play the part of arterial blood in its action upon these tissues, and that air which is changed by this process may play the part of venous blood; or else (2) that the air may act as it would seem to act in the production of the respiratory movements of the chest, an action to which further reference will have to be made presently. (67) Nor do the facts which illustrate the action of the blood upon the muscular coats of the ordinary vessels reflect any doubt upon the conclusions wiiich may be drawn re- specting the action of the heart, for these facts would seem to show that these coats do not contract when they are acted upon by arterial blood, and that they do contract when they are directly or indirectly deprived of this action. (68) The fact that the peristaltic movements of the alimentary canal are increased when the admission of blood to its coats is prevented

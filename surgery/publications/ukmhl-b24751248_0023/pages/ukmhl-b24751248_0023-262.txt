After the operation the condition of the nrin was most satisfactory, tlie ends of the bones being well separated, and the amount of suppuration small. No pain what- ever in the part Avas complained of by the jmtient. Unfoi'tuuatcly the case terminated fatally from tuberculosis; but so far as the treatment of the elbow went, everything was most satisfactory, tlie patient being perfectly easy, and the external incision healing rapidly."

Smith recommends a method of amputating the leg, which in its results is essentially the same as the process by a single outer flap long since reconnnended by Sedillot ('M6d. Operat.,' 2nd edit., vol. i, p. 444). He says—"The multitude of amputations below the knee which I have performed, seen, and watched the result of, have con- vinced me that none of the ordinary methods are the best possible in any case, least of all in army surgery. I have yet to see the circular operation heal without great suppuration ; and the posterior flap opera- tion has, in five cases out of six, been complicated with the protrusion of the spine of the tibia. This with a heavy posterior flap can scarcely be prevented. The double flap is nearer the truth, but the (in my estimation) proper operation difters widely from that. It is briefly described thus:—Standing on either side, transfix the limb at the point you intend to saw the bones, with the flat of the knife against the posterior surface of both tibia and fibula; then cut downwards for about five inches, keeping the knife closely applied to the surface of the bones. Next bring the back of tlie knife to its first position, pressing back against the commencement of the incision. Then witli a quick movement of the wrist cut a posterior flap of one or two inches

CANCEU OF THE LIP. 275 cancer. Eigal and Bonnet blame the irritation of teeth injured by the pipe. Eechnitz maintains that cancer of the lip is very frequent in Hungary, because the acrid juice of the very strong tobacco, which is chewed or smoked there, irritates the lips. Glintner (' Prag. Viertelj.,' vol. xlii, p. 64), remarks, that almost all his patients had been passionate smokers; on the second or third day after the operation, he found them secretly smoking behind ,the bed-hangings. Bouisson ('Montpellier Medical,' 1859) adduces forty-nine cases of cancer of the lip, all of which, were in smokers. On the other hand, Bardeleben has operated on many patients in Greifswald, who had never smoked (' Canstatt's Jahresber.,' J 854, iv, 183). Fleury, in Clermont, has observed similar cases. Bruns had only ten great smokers in fifty-five cases, and one, in whom the disease afiected the left angle of the mouth, asserted that he had always held his pipe in the right side of his mouth. Heurtaux also saw such cases ; four out of nine cases reported by him had never smoked, and in five smokers the disease was only in two where the pipe usually rested. Lortet could trace no effect of smoking in the eases at the Hotel-Dieu at Lyon. According to Heiirtaux, Lemarchand had seen at Tinistere, where almost all the women smoke short pipes, about 100 cases of cancer of the lower lip in men, and not a single case in a woman. "We have already mentioned, that in the East, where everybody smokea, cancer of the lip does not occur.

Pitha'treated a case of popliteal aneurism by forced flexion for a lengthened period without success, but finally succeeded in curing it by- combining flexion with compression of the femoral; tbe duration of tbe treatment was about four moiitlis ('Allg. Wien. Med. Zeit.,' 1863, p. 130). A case of arterio-venous aneurism, apparently the one discussed in the 'Year-book' for 1862 (p. 245), was treated by Nelaton, who opened the sac and tied the vessels aljove and below. The operation took not less than an hour and a half. Ten days later, bEemorrhage occurred from the upper end, but was arrested by tbe introduction of a small piece of sulphate of iron into the artery and compression. Ultimately the bleeding recurred, and the patient sank (' Gaz. d. Hop.,' I863, p. 394). P. Broca relates at length (' Gaz. d. H6p.,' 1863, p. 453) an extraordinary case of arterio-venous aneurism at tbe bend of the elbow, with enormous secondary dilation of the brachial, axillary, and sub- clavian arteries. Owing to a slough forming on the sac, and hajmor- rhage occurring, amputation was performed through tbe middle of the arm. As a preliminary measure, the axillary was ligatured; this 14

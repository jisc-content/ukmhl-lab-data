STATISTICS; ETC. 843 (6) Of the 5 mothers who died (i primipara, 4 raultiparse), 3 were from puerperal peritonitis and 2 from uterine phlebitis. (7) Of the 4'; children born dead, 20 were priraiparous and 25 miU- tiparous. In 18 cases the children were premature—5 primiparous, 13 multiparous. Of tlie 27 at full time, 15 were primiparous and 12 multiparous. Of the 15 primiparous, 7 were dead before labour commenced and 8 died during labour. Hence the danger to the child is nearly three times as great in a first pregnancy as in subsequent ones, and nearly five times as great in a first labour. But the ratio 01 mortality from pressure on the head of the child during labour was m primiparfe i to 73, while in multiparas it was i to 780. Can anything be done to prevent or diminish this excess of infant mortality in first labours ? The author is convinced that the true answer to this is, that in all difficult or tedious cases we ought to employ the forceps much sooner in primiparous than in non-primiparous ones, if we would give our patient an equal chance of having a living child. A comparison of the above statistics with those of large lying-in hospitals is instructive, as showing a far greater liability to diseases of the puerperal state, and hence a much higher rate of mortality in the latter institutions. Prof. Hecker states, in his ' Clinical Eeport of the Lying-in Hospital at Munich' for the year ending October, 1862 (' Mon. f. Geb.,' p. 395, May, 1863), that of 913 deliveries (304 primi- pai'EB, 609 multipara>), 186 women "fell ill," but of these 44 sufiered from slight maladies; of these, 122 recovered, 7 died, and 57 were transferred to another hospital, of whom 32 recovered and 25 died, giving a general mortality of 3'6 per cent. Of the labours, 85 were premature, and 828 at full term; 928 children were born (tvrins in 15 cases), of whom 18 died before and 20 during birth. The opera- tions were as follows]:—Podalic version, 9 cases; extraction, 16 cases (in 7 after version) ; forceps, 21 cases; Cassarean section, once; reposi- tion of prolapsed funis, once ; of prolapsed arm, 3 cases; removal of the placenta, 3 cases. The funis prolapsed in 3 cases of head presentation (in 2 the children were saved, in one case by reposition, in the other by extraction with the forceps ; in a third case the festal heart was heard 20 hours after reposition of the funis, but the child was born asphyxi- ated) ; in 4 cases with pelvis and cross presentations (all the children born dead). . Partial placenta prsevia occurred in two primiparse, with, in both cases, cessation of the haemorrhage after rupture of the mem- branes and the birth of dead premature children. Haemorrhage, post- partum, occurred in 13 cases, but with no fatal result. 11132 cases rupture of the perinaeum occurred (27 primiparae, ^ multiparae), but in no case did the laceration involve the sphincter ani. A complete cure was obtained by primary union in 17 cases, in 8 a partial cure, the remaining 7 were discharged uncured. The indications for the forceps —employed in 13 primiparae and 8 multiparaj—were, contraction of the pelvis, 2 cases ; abnormal position of the head, 4 cases; abnormal rela- tion between head and pelvis, 2 cases ; prolapse of the fimis, 3 cases ; atony of the uterus, long duration of the expulsive pains, and danger to

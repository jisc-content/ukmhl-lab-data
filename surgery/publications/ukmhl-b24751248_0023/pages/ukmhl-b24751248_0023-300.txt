Kor cau, iu that manner, any considerable (juaafcity of a liquid be injected into the tympanic cavity, even where tlie ))crincability of tlie tube has been proved by tlie bougie and auscultation. On the other hand, both Bucceed when a tine elastic catheter is introduced as far as the osseous portion of the tube. 2. The sounds produced by blowing arise iu the tympanic cavity, only when the second method is employed; those which are perceived, when air is blown through the ordinary silver cathether, probably arise within the pharyngeal extremity of the tube. 3. A change in the latter shows some obstacle to the conduction of sound; it also shows whether the obstacle is moved or not by blowing, but no conclusion can be drawn from it as to changes in tlie walls of the tube or tympanic cavity. 4. It must remain for the present a question whether " free exuda- tions " can be removed from the tympanic cavity by blowing through a very delicate catheter. 5. It has been proved beyond all doubt, that bougies can be introduced through the catheter as far as the tympanic cavity. 6. The value of bougies in respect to diagnosis and treatment can therefore be scarcely doubted. M. Triquet, clinical lectures on the diseases of the ear (pp. 260, Paris, P. Savy). J.

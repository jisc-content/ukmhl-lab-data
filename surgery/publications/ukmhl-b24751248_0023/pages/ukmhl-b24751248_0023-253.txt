Busch has published some contributions to our knowledge of the mechanism aud methods of reduction of dislocations, founded upon cases occurring at the Bonn Clinic ('Arch. f. Klin. Chir.,' iv, i). It has become, during the last few years, more and more certain that the difficulties of reduction dependent on the muscles have been much over-estimated, aud on the other hand, that those arising from tension of the capsule have not been sufficiently appreciated. No doubt the muscles may oppose enormous resistance ; it is indeed for this reason that chloroform is of so much value in attempts at reduc- tion. Thanks to this agent, all difficulty caused by active muscular contraction is now entirely removed, and thus the reduction of disloca- tions has been very much facilitated. Yet, under the use of chloroform there still remains the resistance which arises from the tension of muscles, so displaced from their usual position, that their points of attachment are at a greater distance from one another than in the normal condition; for this reason it has been recommended to bring the limb as much as possible into such a position as would relax the tense muscles. The tension, however, which is caused by the elasticity and stretching of the muscles, never presents any very * See also 'Brit, and For. Med.-Chir.

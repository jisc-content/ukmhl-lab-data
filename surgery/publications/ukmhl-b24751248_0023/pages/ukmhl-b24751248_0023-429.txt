EEPOET OS TOXICOLOGY AND MATERIA MEDICA. BY C. HILTON FAGGE, M.D., DEMOKSTBATOE OF ANATOMY AND LECTUEEE ON EXPERIMENTAIi PHILOSOPHY AT cry's HOSPITAL ; PHYSICIAN TO THE EOYAL INFIE3IARY FOR THE DISEASES OF CHILDREN. DIALYSIS. De. Haevey gives an account of some experiments made by him, with reference to the detection of poisons by dialysis ('Lancet,' 1863, vol. i, p. 6). The metallic poisons, mercury, antimony and arsenic, were of course easily found by this process, even in organic liquids. It was, however, found that in the case of organic poisons mixed with " colloid " substances, sufficient amorphous matter passed through the membrane to obscure, and in some instances to render nugatory, the application of the colour-tests. This was the case, for example, in an experiment in which some strychnia was mixed with three eggs, and the mass was then submitted to dialysis; but on concentrating the fluid, and then extracting the strychnia by ether, the colour-test was successfully employed. No reaction was obtained by this process from the stomach (with its contents) of a man poisoned by opium ; but it is not stated Avhether the ordinary methods of analysis gave a better result. Cossa (' Gaz. Med. Ital. Lombard.,' 1862; Canstatt, Band vii, p. 66) finds that the dialyser need not be kept in the external fluid more than a quarter of an hour, when arsenic is the poison sought for. Morphia and phosphorus are also capable of detection by this method. MECHANICAL IHEITANTS. Pereles ('Allg. Wien. Med. Zeit.,' No. 32, p. 254) relates the case of a woman, sc-t. 34, who on account of disordered digestion swallowed a quantity of coarsely powdered glass, in order to " scour out" her stomach. Intense pain in the stomach came on, with tenderness; the pulse became small, too in the minute, and there were thirst 26

208 llEPOKT ON SURGKUY. IjiisLly, tlio comparisoQ of doubtful cases with others which are analo- gous in all respects—with this exception, that in tliem tlie existence of syphilis, as a cause, has been demoustrated—may frequently afford us valuable assistance in making out our diagnosis. It should not be forgotten that a patient who has never conti'acted the disease in its primary form may suffer all the sad and fatal conse- quences of sypliilis ; for the hereditary is quite as competent as the acquired form of the disease to produce afiections of the nervous system. The ditfei-ent elements of diagnosis must be drawn— 1. Erom previous symptoms of syphilis, which should always be sought out with anxious eai-e. 2. Erom any existing symptoms of the diathesis. 3. Sometimes from the form and characters of the nervous afiections. 4. Prom the comparison of the case in question witli others already recorded. 5. Trom the results of specific treatment, allowing, on the one hand, for its- occasional failure in undoubted syphilitic diseases, and on the other, for its success in various other complaints. M. H.

71 NEUVOUS SYSTEJr. unless it retain a certain share of its natural electricity. (21) The natu- ral electricity which is present in living motor nerve or muscle during the stage of inaction is almost or altogether absent when the state of action is produced by means of artificial electricity. (22) When part of a motor nerve is included in a galvanic circuit, contraction may be pro- duced by acting upon the part of the nerve which lies between the muscle and the nearest galvanic pole, if it be the negative, but not if it be the positive. (23) When a part of a motor nerve is included in a galvanic circuit, the natural electricity of the parts of the nerve which lie beyond the circuit is increased in intensity on the side of the positive and dimi- nished in intensity on the side of the negative pole. (24) In the case where a muscle may be made to contract by acting upon the part of the nerve which lies between the part included in the galvanic circuit and the muscle, the negative pole is next the muscle, and the natural electricity of the part of the nerve acted on is diminished in intensity by the action of this pole; in the case where a muscle may not be made to contract by acting upon the part of the nerve which lies between the part included in the galvanic circuit and the muscle, the positive pole is next the muscle, and the natural electricity of the part of the nerve acted upon is increased in intensity by the action of this pole. (25) Before the time when the galvanic current has paralysed the part of a motor nerve which is in- cluded in the circuit, the muscle contracts with a moderate degree of force, both at the closing and opening of the circuit, and the order of the contraction is the same whether the positive or the negative pole be nearest to the muscle. (26) After the time when a galvanic current has paralysed the part of a motor nerve which is included in the circuit, the muscle contracts stronglyâ€”at the closing of the circuit, and not at the opening, if the negative pole be next the muscle ; and at the opening of the circuit, and not at the closing, if the positive pole be in this position. (27) When under the action of galvanism on its nerve, a muscle con- tracts at the closing of the circuit, and not at the opening, the negative pole is next the muscle, and the natural electricity of the part of the nerve which intervenes between the circuit and the muscle is diminished in intensity by the action of this pole ; and hence it follows that the pre- sence of contraction at the closing of th'e circuit is coincident with the departure of electricity from the part of the nerve acted upon, and that the absence of contraction at the opening of the circuit is coincident with the absence of electricity in the same locality. (28) When under the action of galvanism upon its nerve, a muscle contracts at the opening of the circuit, and not at the closing, the positive pole is next the muscle, and the natural electricity of that part of the nerve which intervenes between the circuit and the muscle is increased in intensity by the action of this pole ; and hence it follows that the absence of contraction at the (closing of the circuit is coincident with the addition of electricity to the part of the nerve acted upon, and that the presence of contraction at the opening of the circuit is coincident with tlie subtraction of the electricity which had been added to the part of the nerve acted upon during the time the circuit remained closed. (29) When a motor nerve has been acted upon by galvanism until the part which lies between the circuit and the muscle has, under the action of the negative pole, lost its natural eleg.

Prof. Eoser has published his experience and views of this operation in his 'Handbook of Anatomical Surgery' (4th ed., Tlibingen, 1863), and in the ' Archiv der Heiikunde' (vol. ii). A full account of his opinion.s in regard to its use in croup is also contained in a ' Guide to Tracheotomy in Croup,' by M. Lissard (Griessen, 1861). He points out, that it is of importance to distinguish threatening suiFocation (Erstickungsangst) from asphyxia. Any obstacle to the free passage of air will induce symptoms of these' conditions. Genuine suffocation is usually preceded for a longer or shorter period by pre- monitory symptoms; thus, in croup, the asphyxia follows a very marked stage of suffocative agony, during which children struggle with forced respirations to overcome the obstacle ; in this period the blood is still very red,—indeed, even that of the veins is strikingly so. Should they be left in this condition till their muscular power is exhausted, and till asphyxia—overloading of the blood with carbon — has really com- menced, the prognosis, will, of course, be much more unfavorable. Asphyxia sometimes occurs in a more acute manner, and is characterised by such symptoms as sudden blueness of the face, fixed and staring eyes, convulsive anxious exertions and struggles for breath,—or in the form of a more slow suffocation, with symptoms of great weariness and weakness, restlessness, oppression, anxious startiugs out of short slumbers, loss of consciousness and of feeling, sopor, the face being often pale and rather oedematous. Both the danger to life and the agony of the patient are proportional to the acuteness of the symptoms. An important sign of obstruction in the air-passages is sinkiu"^-iu of the intercostal spaces, of the clavicular fossw, and of the scrobiculus cordis,

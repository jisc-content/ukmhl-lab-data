His conclusions are, that coagulation is in no degree connected with the evolution of ammonia, any more than with the influence of oxygen or rest. The real cause of the coagulation of tlio Llood, when shed from the bodr, is the influence exerted upou it by ordinary matter, the contact of which, for a very brief period, effects a change in the blood, inducing a mutual reaction between its solid and its fluid constituents, in which the corpuscles impart to the liquor sanguinis a disposition to coagulatOi- This reaction, he holds—agreeing in this with Schmidt—to be probably simply chemical in its nature ; yet its product, the fibrin, when mixed with blood-corpuscles in the form of an undisturbed coagulum, resem- bles healthy living tissues, in being incapable of that catalytic action upon the blood which is effected by all ordinary solids, and also by the tissues themselves when deprived of their vital properties. Tlie bearing of this fact upon inflammation is immediate. If we inquire what is the great peculiarity of inflamed parts in relation to the blood, as examined by the naked eye, we see that it consists in a tendency to induce coagulation in their vicinity, implying that the affected tissues have lost, for the time being, their vital properties, and comport them- selves like ordinary solids. Thus, when an artery or vein is inflamed, coagulation occurs upon its interior, in spite of the current of blood, precisely as would take place if it had been artificially deprived of its vital properties. On one occasion Lister simulated the characteristic adherent clot of phlebitis by treating the jugular vein of a living sheep with caustic ammonia, and then allowing the circulation to go on through the vessel for a while, when, on slitting it up, its lining membrane was found studded with grains of pink fibrin, which could be detached only by scraping firmly with the edge of a knife. Again, comparing an inflammatory exudation into the pericardium or into the interstices of the cellular tissue with dropsical effusions into the same situations, we are struck with the fact that, while the liquor sanguinis effused in dropsy remains fluid, the inflammatory product coagulates. Now, we know that in intense inflammation, the capillaries are choked, more or less, with accumulated blood-corpuscles, which must cause great increase in the pressure of the blood upon their walls; and from what we know of the eflfect of venous obstruction in causing dropsical eftusions of liquor sanguinis through increased pressure, we are sure that Ave have in the inflammatory state the physical conditions for a similar transuda- tion of fluid through the walls of the capillaries. And the n.atural interpretation of the diflerence in the two cases, as regards coagulation, seems to be that, whereas in dropsy the fluid is forced through the pores of healthy vessels, in inflammation the capillary parietes have lost their healthy condition, and act like ordinary matter; so that the liquor sanguinis, having been subjected immediatelj^ before eflusion to the combined influence of the injured tissue and the blood-cor- puscles, has acquired a disposition to coagulate, just like the bufly coat of horse's blood shed into a glass, or like the frog's liquor sanguinis filtered by Miller from its corjniscles, the injured vessels acting upon

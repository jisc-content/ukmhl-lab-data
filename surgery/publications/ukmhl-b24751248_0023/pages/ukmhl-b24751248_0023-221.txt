SEPTIC/EMIA. 193 odour of sulphuretted hydrogen, aud that from inauy acute suppuratious pus of the latter kind possesses no special clieniical charactcrB.^ Hectic has been by many authors represented as a kind of chronic pysemia; it would be more correctly considered a chronic septictemia. AV'e cannot, howevei-, state with any definiteness how far the shiver- ing, fever, and sweating, depend on" the admixture of noxious agents rather than on the daily loss of constituents of the blood. No one, it appears, has any idea how to explain the morbus Brightii which so often supervenes on chronic suppurations. The same is the case in respect to the aphthous process on the mucons membrane of the mouth and fauces ; though, perhaps, a part of such cases may be connected with ammonisemia, we are still far from a special etiology. There are many extremely fetid abscesses which cause few or no general symptoms ot disease in the body; this may depend upon the walls of the abscess being callous and impeding absorption, or upon the odorous substances not being those which exert the most injurious influence. We are yet far from knowing what are the products of decomposing pus, and which of them are specially noxious. The volatile fatty acids, and their compounds with ammonia, are clearly not the most important, nor yet are the sulphuretted hydrogen aud ammonia. An important advance will, perhaps, be made in the doctrine of septictemia, when the chemical constitution of the fixed putrid poison discovered by Panum has been more accurately determined. Dr. A. Cantani has experimented with PoUi's treatment i(sulphite of magnesia 'Year Book,' 1862, p. 215), and has found it of service in some cases (' Arch. d. Heilk.,' 1863, p. 278). Gangrene.—"W.

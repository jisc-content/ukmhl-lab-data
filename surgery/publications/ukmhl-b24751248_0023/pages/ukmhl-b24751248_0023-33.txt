CinCULATION AND HESPIRATIOX. 21 coiisunied, 82 to 85 parts were given ofF in COo; in one case there wan an excess of C0"„ Avinch contained 509 grammes (17 pounds) of oxygen, in place of 483 (i6'o3 pounds) consumed. The turkeys and geese confirmed tlie results previously obtained, with fowls. There is an exhalation of nitrogen, but none of hydrogen: 77-7 per cent, of the 0 consumed is given otF in the C0._,; for fowls, the mean Avas 92 per cent. The following table exhibits the normal respiration of a sheep, and its respiration when suftering under an attack of mcfeorization.

The object of Sczelkow's researches was to establish the relation l)ot\veen the consumed oxygen and various processes of oxidation, in their dependence upon muscular activity. Three series of observations were made—(i) to determine the modification the total interchange of gases in the bodj^ undergoes, through the interruption or diminution of the stream of blood in a given mass of muscle ; (2) to examine the changes which take place in the gases of the blood supplied to the muscles; (3) to compare the total interchange of gases in the body during rest with the same during muscular activity. The first series of experiments were made on rabbits ; the abdominnl aorta was compressed, the absorption of O and exhalation of COo being examined before and after. The results were indecisive; neither the amount of the COo nor of the O, nor the relation of the two, was affected in a constant manner, and this independently of the quietude or restlessness of the animal, although this latter had in one case a marked effect in increasing the exhalation of COo. In the second series of experiments blood taken from the vena pro- funda femoris in dogs, both while the limb was at rest and after it had been thrown into contraction, was compared in respect to its gaseous contents with blood from the carotid artery. The following results were obtained:—(1) The colour of the venous blood was in some cases brighter, in some darker, after contraction than before. 1 n one case, thougli brighter, it contained less oxygen. (2) In the muscle, while at rest, there goes on a rapid formation of CO.,, the venous blood containing, on an average, 671 per cent, more than the arterial. After contraction this average is increased to 10-79 P®^ cent. ; and the increase is the more considerable, inasmuch as tlie circulation is also quickened. (.3) The oxygen in the venous blood, when the muscle is at rest, is 9 per cent, less than in arterial; after contraction it sinks llfallliy. Diseased.

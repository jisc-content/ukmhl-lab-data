IIEPORT ON SUllGERY. BY THOMAS WINDSOE, SUBGEON TO THE SALfOED BOYAl HOSPITAL, AND TO THE MANCIIEBTEE EYE HOSPITAL. Treatises and collections of cases.—In addition to further portions of works already quoted in former reports, we have to notice ' Outlines of Surgery,' by F. Le Gros Clark, and ' Lectures on Surgery,' by "W. Lawrence; the surgery of Maitre Jean Tpermans, the father of Flemish surgery, edited by J. Carolus (pp. 191, Gand) ; the collected works of M. Burggraeve (6 vols, and atlas, Gand); the ' Clinique Chirur- gicale' of J. G. Maisonneuve (2 vols., Paris); and a new edition, the fourth, of W. Roser's well-known ' Handbook of Anatomical Surgery' (Tubingen, Laupp). Surijical Pathology.—A new edition, with many additions, of J. Paget's ' Lectures on Surgical Pathology' (London, Longman). Surgical Anatomy.—The third edition of the ' Ohirurgico-Anatomical Vade-Mecum,' by W. Roser (pp. 284, Stuttg., Ebner and Seubert). Military Surgery.—A treatise by L. Legouest (pp. 1000, Paris, J. B. Bailliere), and an account of the African campaigns, by A. Bertherand (Paris, 1862). Introduction of air into the veins.—M. Ore has recently experimented on this subject (' Gaz. Hebd.,' 1863, p. 33). He found, that, though an animal is inevitably killed by the introduction of a given quantity of atmospheric air, an equal and even greater amount of nitrogen, of hydrogen, or of carbonic acid, may be injected with impunity into another animal of the same weight and race. Oxygen may be intro- duced in almost any amount. An animal which would have been unable to bear 80 cubic centimetres of air scarcely suffered from the introduction of 300 cubic centimetres of oxygen. Death may be pre- vented by the use of electrical currents in such a way as to provoke energetic respiratory movements, even when a quantity of air is injected otherwise suflicient to at once destroy the animal.

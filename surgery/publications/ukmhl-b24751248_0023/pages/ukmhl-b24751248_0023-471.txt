EEPOET ON FOEENSIC MEDICINE. BY Dr. C. HILTON FAGGE. LITERATURE. Casper publishes, under the title of ' Klinische Novellen zur Gericht- liclien Medicin' (Berlin, Hirschwald, 1863), a ^'olume which is full of practical observations on niedico-legal questions.

Van Deen ('Bonders' und Berlin's Archiv,' Band iii, Heft 2; ' Canstatt,' Band vii, p. 62) has proposed a new and very delicate test for blood. The suspected stain is first treated with water, some

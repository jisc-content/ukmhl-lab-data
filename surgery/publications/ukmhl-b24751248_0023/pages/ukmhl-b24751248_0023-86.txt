('■,6) This theory of muscular motion is not contradicted hy any fact which renders it necessary to suppose that an increased dis- position to muscular contraction is connected with a state of exalted func- tional activity in a vital property of irritability in muscle or nerve, (ly) On the other hand, it would seem that this theory of muscular motion derives no small amount of confirmation from the fact that it provides a jihi/sical explanation for the state of muscular relaxation no less than for the state of muscular contraction, and brings ordinary muscular con- traction and rigor mortis under the dominion of one and the same law, (V) On rhythmical muscular motion.—(58) When the ventricles pass out of the state of systole into that of diastole, their muscular walls receive a fresh supply of blood through the coronary arteries. When the ventricles return from the state of diastole into that of systole, the blood which was injected into their walls at the previous systole has had time to lose its arterial properties ; and thus the blood would seem to play the same part in the movements of the ventricles as that which it plays in ordinary muscular motion, for it has been seen that the state of relaxation (the natural state of living muscle when left to itself) is not disturbed by contraction when arterial blood is supplied to the arterial system, and that the state of relaxation is disturbed in this manner when arterial blood is not supplied, or (what is the same thing) when venous blood is sup- plied in place of arterial. (59) When the ventricles pass out of the state of systole into that of diastole, their muscular coats would seem to iTceive a due supply of nervous influence from the rhythmic nervous centres of the heart, for at this time these nervous centres must be roused into a state of full functional activity by the arterial blood which has just been propelled into these coats through the coronary vessels by the ven- tricular systole; when the ventricles return from the state of diastole into that of systole, their muscular walls would seem to be deprived of the nervous influence which they had been receiving from the rhythmic nervous centres during the diastole, for at the time of the new systole the blood which had been propelled into the coats of the heart at the previous systole has had time to lose those arterial properties which are necessary to keep these nervous centres in a state of functional activity; and thus nervous influence would seem to play the same part in the movements of the ventricles which it plays in ordinary muscular action, for it has been seen that the state of muscular relaxation is not disturbed by contraction so long as the muscles receive a due supply of nervous influence, and that this state of relaxation is disturbed in this manner at the moment when the supply of nervous influence is interrupted. (60) When the auricles pass from the state of systole into that of diastole, the main reasons would appear to be—(i) that the circulation through the heart is arrested for the moment, first of all by the ventricles having t.ikeu in as much blood as they can take in at their diastole, and afterwards by the auriculo-ventriculai- valves becoming closed at the ventricular systole; and (a) that in consequence of the circulation being arrested in this manner, the auricles relax and fill out under the pressure of the stream of blood which is continually setting in from the valveless openings of the great veins:

DISEASES OF -WOMEN. 395 Di'. Saexinger relates 3 cases of cystic tumours of the vagina. ' Spitals-Zeitung,' Sept. 1863. All 3 cases are very similar, and in all the application of nitrate of silver rapidly effected a cure. Dr. Hard- wicke records a case, * Lancet,' vol. i, 1863, p, 326, were a non-pedan- culated tumour larger than an orange was found in the recto-vaginal septum in a woman in labour, and pressing forwards into the vagina. It was pushed down, and rendered tense by the child's head at each pain. The cyst was punctured, and about a pint of serous fluid escaped. Dr. Barnes—A case, 'Med.

Bossi (' Spitals Zeitung,' 1862), relates 14 cases of eclampsia, which occurred witliin thirty-one months, among 4500 patients at the Lying- in Hospital of Graz. Of the 14 cases, 13 were primiparae. Of the mothers, 8 recovered, and 6 died. In all these last there was intense Bright's disease, with great hyperemia of the meninges, or of the brain itself, and in 5 cases oedema of the lungs. Of the children, 2 were born dead, and 12 lived ; 13 presented with the head, and i case—twin, with the bi'eech. Of the 15 children, 10 were extracted by the forceps, and i by perforation with cephalotripsy. The treatment adopted was, venesection in two cases, without success; chloroform in- halation one case, Avithout success ; enemata of opium in 7 cases, 3 died, 4 recovered. Subcutaneous injection of morphia 4 cases; 2 died, 2 re- covered. Applications of ice, and cold douche to the head, in 3 cases —all 3 recovered. Dr. Earasbotham, ' Clinical Midwifery' (' Med. Times and Gaz.,' vol. i, 1863, pp. 105, 235, 288), relates a series of cases of puerperal convulsions, which occurred in his practice during the years 1840— 1844. The number of cases was 19. Of these, 11 were primiparae, 7 were multipart, and in i case, it is not mentioned whether the patient was a primipara. In 14 cases, the convulsions occurred either before or during labour; and in 5, after the child's birth. Of the former series, 8 were at the full period of pregnancy; and in 6, labour came on prematurely. Of the latter series, _5 were at the full period; and in one, labour was premature. Three were twin-cases; in one, both children presented with the feet, which were brought down artifici- ally ; in another, both were delivered by forceps. One child was de- livered by turning, 5 by craniotomy, and' 12 passed naturally. Of the mothers, 15 recovered, and 4 died. Of the 4 fatal cases, one was a case of pure apoplexy. Of the 22 children, 6 were saved, and 16 bom dead. The author remarks on the peculiar liability of primiparse, especially if it be a twin gestation, to attacks of convulsions, and adds^ that of 111 cases attended by himself, 79 were primiparae, The opinioii

77 OF LIPS. treatment. The injection of perchloricle of iron, tannic acid solution, or chloride of zinc, may effect a cure in most cases ; but a temporary ligature should always be applied, and left on for about a quarter of an hour, to prevent any accident arising from the direct entrance of the styptic fluid into the blood stream. AVheu the whole substance of the lip is involved, inclusion and strangulation of the morbid mass by means of the ligature are seldom a^'ailable ; the amount of sloughing being very great, and the child, absorbing the putrescent matters from the sloughing mass which results, incurring the danger of being poisoned from this source. In an infant with a very large nmvus, including one half of the lip, which I ligatured at the Hospital some years ago, death aj)peared to Fig. 431.—Nifivus of Lower Lip: Side View. Fig. 430.—Xaevus of Lower Lip : Front View. I result from this cause. One of the most formidable cases of nsevus of the lip I that I have ever had to do with, and in its results the most satisfactory, was sent to me several years ago, by Budd of Barnstaple. The patient, a little girl five years old, was noticed at birth to have a red streak on the right i side of the upper lip ; this rapidly developed into a large tumid purple na3vus, Fig. 433.—Lni-g(‘ Niovu.s of Upper Lip: Side View. Fig. 432.—Tjnrgc Nfcviis of Upper I.ij): Front View. which, when the case came under my observation, was about the size of a lapm walnut, involving the whole of the structures of the lip, from the cutaneous to the mucous surfaces ; it was of a deep mulbeny colour, and extended from the median line of the lip to the angle of the mouth (Figs. 4532,433).

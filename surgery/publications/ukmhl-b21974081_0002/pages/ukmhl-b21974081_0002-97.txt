OPERATIVE TREATMENT OF VARIX. 65 iirst, and they should be left in for at least a week or ten days, by which time the obliteration of the vessel will have taken place. I believe that all the danger of the operation consists in the transfixion of the vein by the pin; the operator may always know when he has done this by the escape of a few drops of venous blood ; Avhen the pin is propeily passed under and clear of the vein, the operation is a perfectly bloodless one. If the vein be transfixed, the pin should immediately be withdrawn and passed at another point ; if it be allowed to remain in the vein, it Avill act as a foreign body, and septic changes in the thrombus may ensue. When the vein is properly compressed between the pin below and the bougie aboA'e, it becomes safely obliterated at the point of pressure. By attention to these circumstances I haA*e never met with any ill- consecpiences, either from phlebitis or pymmia, in any of the cases in which I have perfonned this operation, which are several hundreds in number. In addition to the application of the pins in the usual Avay, H. Lee has re- â€¢ commended the subcutaneous division of that portion of the vein which is ! included between them, after coagulation of the blood has taken place. This I have found to be an useful addition to the ordinary treatment, and to insure the obliteration of the vessel. The points of the pins may be prevented from pressing injuriously upon the skin, by putting small pieces of adhesive plaster under them. Whilst the i pins are in, the patient must not be allowed to move about, and after they have been taken out, the limb should be bandaged for some time. In general, 1 no ulceration takes place about the pin-hole apertures ; but occasionally, in = debilitated constitutions, a sore forms, which requires to be treated on ordinary . principles. VOL, II. F

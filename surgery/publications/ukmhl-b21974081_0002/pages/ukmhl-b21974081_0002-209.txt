177 LIGATURE OF BOTH CARO TIDE-RESULTS. By this it will be seen that the most commou cause of death after ligature of the carotid is cerebral disease induced by the operation (as was, I believe, timt pointed out by Ohevers) : and this result appears to have been relati\'ely more fivipient after the distal than after the Hunterian operation. If to these cases we add 14 in which the brachio-cejdialic artery was ligatured, we get a total of 38(! cases, of which DG were attended by cerebral symptoms ; or, as nearly as possible, 2o per cent. AVe should necessarily expect that, in those cases in which both vessels liad been ligatured, there would be a greater tendency to cerebral disturbance than in those in which only one had been deligated. It would hoAvever appear, as is shown by the following table, that of twenty-seven instances in which the double operation htis been performed, death is recorded to have happened but in two cases fi’om this cause ; while in another, in which convulsions took place, a fatal result did not occur, and three other cases were attended by mere tempo- rary disturbance of vision. In the only case (that of Mott, No. 16) in which both carotids were ligatured simultaneously, with an interval of only a few minutes between the operations, coma and death resulted.

I celled 22, of which 13 were simple, 3 ossifying and 6 developing into cartilage, which in some cases was subsequently becoming ossified or calcified ; mixed round- and spindle-celled 28, of which 11 were simple, G ossifying, 5 calcifying and C developing cartilage. When the tumour ossifies or calcifies it does not penetrate deeply into the compact tissue ; when these changes do not take place the bone becomes eroded and spontaneous fi’acture is very hkely to occur. The pain accompanying a subperiosteal tumour is usually less severe than that of a central sarcoma. The tumour varies in consistence according to its nature from firm and elastic to semi-fluctuating. In some cases pulsa- tion of a thrilling kind, with or without a bruit, is distinctly perceptible, especially in an advanced stage of the disease, when the vascularity of the tumour is gi’eatly increased. Cysts are not uncommon in the softer forms of ssircoma. Diagnosis.—Central sarcoma of bone in its early stages so closely resembles chronic osteitis and pd'iostitis that it is frequently impossible to come to a correct conclusion as to the nature of the case without cutting down on the bone and ajjplying the trephine. In the later stages the diagnosis becomes more easy ; the great enlargement of the bone, the occurrence of “ egg-shell crackling” on pressure, and more especially pulsation when it is present, making the nature of the case clear.

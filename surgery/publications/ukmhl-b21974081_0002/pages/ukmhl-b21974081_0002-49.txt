PERFORATING ULCER OF THE FOOT ^7 pointed out that the disease is associated in many cases with thickening of the endoneurium and atrophy of the hbres of the nerves leading to the affected spot. Savory and Butlin have brought forward evidence to show also that the sensory fibres are chiefly, if not solely, affected. Similar ulcerations are met with in some cases of locomotor ataxy. It may therefore be concluded that the primary cause of the disease is impairment of nutrition consequent upon degenerative changes taking place either in the nerves leading to the affected parts or in that portion of the sensory columns of the cord that is in communication with the foot. In some respects it resembles the disease kno^^^l as anaesthetic leprosy. The Treaimeni consists in amputation of the affected part. In order that this operation may be effective it should be done above the area of ansesthesia in the foot or leg. VOI.. II. r

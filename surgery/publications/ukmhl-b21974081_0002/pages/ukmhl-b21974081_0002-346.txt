314 STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN BONE. are of four kinds, myeloid or mixed spindle- and round-celled.

Shows the giant-celled, spindle-celled, round-celled, and These are further modified hy the formation of cysts, calcification, ossification, and the development of cartilage. Eighty-one cases collected by Butlin showed the following structure : round-celled 22, of which 17 were simple, 1 calcified, 3 ossifying, and 1 fibroid; spindle-celled 19, of Avhich 15 were simple, 2 developing cartilage, and 2 calcified; mixed-cel led 22, of which 18 were simple, 3 ossifying, and 1 calcified ; and myeloid 17, of which 14 were simple and 3 contained bony spicula. According to Gross, if the long bones only be con- sidered, myeloid tumours form a much larger proportion than in Butlin’s table. All the central sarcomata, except the myeloid, tend to diffuse themselves widely through the medullary canal ; the myeloid tumour often remains tolerably sharply limited to the articular end of the bone in glistsiiiiiff l)8.rs of Cftlcifiocl Stronifl^ pcissing ■wliipli if priiTiTnPTippfl Aq q cjit Ween the granular ceUs,wliicli in some ^“^11 ll COmmencea. AS a Central Sai- parts also are calcified. coma gi’ows, the boiie becomes “expanded” by it till a mere shell, often deficient in parts, is left. If the tumour be very soft or contain cysts, this may in parts give the sensation of “ egg-shell crackling.” In 2oeriplieral, or periosteal sarcoma, there is no expansion of bone.

475 CROSS-LEGGED DEFORMITY. of ankylosis of tlie liip-joints. (Fig'- (>00), which Clement Lucas has allowed me to take from one of his cases illustrates admirably the peculiar ])ositions assumed by the lower extremities in this remarkable deformity. Its mode ol origin is somewhat ohseure. The A’iew to which Lucas inclines is pro- bably the correct one, viz., that it is due to a gradual, probably unconsciously developed action on the part of the patient, with the object of placing the limbs in the most favourable positions for progTessiou. One leg is usually Fig. 600.—Cross-legged Deformity. Lucas’s case. affected first—after a time the other follows. Progression is from the knees not the hips. The two limbs usually become equally affected—but in a case that I saw with Tyson, of Folkestone, the left was crossed over the right, the latter being nearly straight. Should it be thought desirable to attempt to correct this defonnity, an anesthetic should be given, and if the ankylosis is not perfect, the adhesions must be broken down and the limbs straightened. If the ankylosis is osseous, the neck of the femur on either side must be cut across with saw or chisel, and the limbs brought into position.

The cold may be ipplied by means of irrigation of iced water, as has been done snccessfully by vlarshall, or by the application of ice either directly to the part or laid upon a ponge covering it, as has been done in some of the cases of ha3mophilia >ccnrring at University College Hospital. Simple Avater may be used, or a v'eak antiseptic solution of boracic acid. If the bleeding Avound be in the xtremities, the limb should bo elcA'ated and kept at rest on a sj^lint. The Surgeon has already been cautioned as to the inexpediency of jAer- brming any operation, except under circumstances of the most urgent neces- ity, on any member of a family of bleeders, or on an individual knoAvn to be he subject of htemophilia. Should an operative procedure become necessary, t should, if possible, be undertaken Avith Paquelin’s thermo-cautery, if it be lesired to make a simple incision ; by the gah-anic ecraseur, if it be expedient 0 remoA'e a part or to perform a small amputation. In the event of the nh^anic ecraseur not being at hand, the elastic ligature would be the best ubstitute.

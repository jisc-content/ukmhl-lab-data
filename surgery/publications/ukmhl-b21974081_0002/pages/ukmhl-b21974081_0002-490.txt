Ihomass splint (bigs. 584, 585) is by far the best apparatus ever invented for the treatment of all forms of hip-disease.

It will, however, often be found most convenient when there is considerable adduction or abduction with acute pain in the early stages of the disease, to correct this by means of the weight-extension used as above described before ai)plying the Thomas’s splint. Thomas’s splint is the only apparatus that maintains absolute rest of the joint, while at the same time the patient is able to move about during the whole or greater part of the treatment. The splint consists of a flat bar of soft iron, varying from three quarters of an inch to an inch and a half in width, and from three-sixteenths to three-eighths of an inch in thickness, according to the age, size, and weight of the patient.

143 RESULTS OF INSTRUMENTAL COMPRESSION. I (liminutioii in the death rate that may be effected by their use. The following • statistics, however, may be quoted as showing the average results of compression as compared with ligature and the steady improvement that has taken place in the latter operation. In 1851, Belhngham published the results of 32 cases of femoral and popliteal aneurism treated by compression in Dublin (^Med.-Chir. Trans., Vol. 34), which may be contrasted with 188 cases of ligature of the femoral for the same disease collected by Norris in 1849. Of the 32 compression-cases 2G were cured ; in 1 the ligature was applied after pressure had failed ; in 2, amputation was performed ; in 1, death occurred from erysipelas ; in 1 from chest-disease; and in 1 case the pressure was discontinued. Thus it would appear that 6 out of the 32 failed, being in the proportion of 1 to 5'3 cases, and 2 ched, being in the ratio of 1 to IG. Of the 188 cases in which the artery was ligatured, 142 were cured, 46 died, 6 were amputated, in 10 the sac suppurated, and in 2 gangrene of the foot occurred. Thus the deaths after ligatime were in the proportion of 1 to 4, and the failures or serious accidents in that of 1 to 3, showing clearly a very considerable preponderance in favour of the treatment by compression. Besides this, in many patients who recovered after the ligature, various accidents, such as gangrene, erysipelas, secondary haemorrhage, &c., resulted as the direct con- • sequences of the treatment; and these do not happen when pressm-e is employed. The perfect safety of the treatment by compression was fully confirmed by the statistics collected by Holmes, and published in his lectures on the 'Surgical Treatment of Aneurism in 1874 ; but the proportion of success is not • so great as in Bellingham’s cases. Of 124 cases of compression for popliteal aneurism collected from the records of British hospitals for a period of 10 •years, 66 succeeded and 58 failed. None died directly from the consequences ‘ of the operation. Of the 58 failures, 44 underwent ligature of the femoral, in 8 amputation was performed, one died of pleurisy, and the subsequent history - of the remainder was uncertain. The failures were, therefore,' 1 in 2T. On the other hand, of 77 cases, in which the femoral was tied directly, 11 died, or 1 in 7. In 1 gangrene occurred, but the patient recovered, and in 1 -secondary haemorrhage was successfully treated. The 11 deaths were caused as follows : pyaemia, 3 ; wound of vein and phlebitis, 2 ; secondary haemorrhage, 2 ; gangrene, 1 ; small pox and disease of the kidneys, 1 each, and 1 was uncertain. Lastly, in 1883, Barwell, in his admirable article on Aneurism, in the In- ternational Encyclopaedia of Surgery, has collected 148 cases of popliteal aneurism treated by compression between 1870 and 1880. Of these, 68 were successful, while 80 ended in failure. Of the unsuccessful cases, 57 submitted ■ to ligature, 9 went away unrelieved, 4 suffered amputation, and 6 died. Of the 6 deaths, 2 occurred from rupture of the sac, 2 from “ thrombosis,” 1 fi-oin -gangrene, and in one the cause was not stated. During the same period, 67 cases of ligature occurred in six of the chief London hospitals. Of these, i 10 died. If these are further subdivided, it will be found that out of 32 cases ''which occurred in the first half of the decade, 7 died and 2 undenvent subse- quent amputation ; while from 1875 to 1879 inclusive, 85 cases occurred, with 3 deaths and no amputations. Whether this great improvement is merely accidental, or is the result of the improvement in the material used as the I

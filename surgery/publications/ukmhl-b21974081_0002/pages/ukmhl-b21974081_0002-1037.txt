1005 ACCIDENTS IN LITHOTRITY. I 9 tbe injected, and the fragment thus forced back. Should these manccuvi’esfail, it lias been proposed to crush the fragments in the urethra with a small litho- trite (Fig. 900) ; but this plan is somewhat hazardous, as it is very difficult to V i nvoid pinching up the mucous membrane of the canal with , the bits of stone. The safest practice seems to be, either to extract them through the urethral ’orifice, or to cut them out through the perinmum. Extraction through the urethral orifice may be effected by the forceps (Figs. 901, 902), or by Civiale’s ■ instrument (Fig. 334, Yol. L). Should these means fail, or should the fragment ' be very deeply seated, as in the membranous portion of the urethra, and the 'local and constitutional irritation produced by it be so great as to threaten :abscess or a fatal termination, the better plan would be to make an incision cdirectly down upon it, and to remove it through the perinasum by a median « 11 ,7 operation of lithotomy. If such an operation as this be required, the Surgeon might possibly feel disposed to extend the incision a little, and empty the 'bladder of any remaining detritus by means of a scoop. The Chronic Enlargement of the Prostate of old jiooplo was formerly <me of the most serious complications of the operation of lithotrity, not so much from the difficulty it caused in the introduction of instruments as Irom ■ the obstacle it offered to the expulsion of the fragments. But even before the introduction of the more perfect evacuators now in use enlarged ju’ostate was not considered by any means an insuperable bar to lithotrity; as, after the J stone had been crushed, the bladder could be emptied by means of the scoop,

T-hc third ■f^ariety of deformity consists in the development of a svper- numerary finger on the ulnar side of the hand, so as to constitute a small and deformed additional little finger. All these varieties of deformity of the fingers are more or less hereditary, and may very easily be removed by opera- Fig. 625.—Supernumerary Fig. 626.—Apparent Thumb.

It is better to do this at as early an age as possible ; no good can possibly come of delay. 4. There is a rare variety of congenital deformity of the hand and fingers.

In some rare cases, as in that from which the annexed drawing (Fig. G2G) was taken, two hands appear to be fused into one. In these cases, no operation can be advantageously iDractised. Besides these, various other kinds of congenital deformity of the fingers are met with. One or more fingers may be preternaturally long, or abnormally short, thick, or atrophied ; or one finger may be entirely absent. The accompanying drawings (Figs. G27 and G28) arc correct representations / (

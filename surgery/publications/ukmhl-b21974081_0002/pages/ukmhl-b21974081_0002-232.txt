This appalling Table needs no comment. It is, to my mind, conclusive as to the merits of the operation, the patient having, in every case but two, been carried off by secondary haemorrhage from the distal side of the ligature, in consequence of the close proximity of numerous col- lateral branches (Fig. 476); and in the two exceptional cases the operation, although performed skilfully, proved fatal in one instance from pericai’ditis and pleurisy, and in the other from pyaemia, before the period at which secondary haemorrhage might have been expected. Liston, in one case, Liga- tured the root of the common carotid, as well as that of the subclavian, hoping in this way to diminish the risk of secondary haemorrhage, by arresting the current of blood which, by sweeping into the carotid past the mouth of the subclavian, would necessarily wash away any coagulum that might be formed in this artery. But his expectations were not realised: haemoiThage took place as usual, and from that portion of the artery which lay on the distal side of the ligature, the blood having been carried into this end of the vessel in a retrograde course, through the connection existing between the vessels arising from it at this point, and those on the opposite side of the head and neck, as illustrated by the annexed cut (Fig. 476), taken from the preparation of the case in the University College Museum. Indeed, this is the great danger to be apprehended after ligature of the subclavian artery on the tracheal side of the scalenus, depending as it does on the anatomical relations and connections of the vessel, which no skill on the Fig. 476.—Ligature of the Subclavian in the First Pai-t of its Course, by Liston. • In this case the carotid was also tied, but the luvinoiThage came from the subclavian (Fig. 477). t Fig. 470. t Carothl also tied. § Keferred to by J. 11.

598 DISEASES OF THE JAWS AND THEIR APPENDAGES. raised from the cliest. An incision is then made, commcncinf? near the symphysis, passing along the under surface of the body qf the jaw as far as the angle and then upwards at the posterior border of the ramus as far as the level of the lobule of the ear. If the tumour be very large it may be neeessary to make an incision upwards towards the lip from the anterior end of that just mentioned or even to divide the lip completely, but this should be avoided if possible. The facial artery and vein are wounded in the first incision and must be at once secured. The flap is then raised and the mucous membrane di’sdded along its reflexion fi’om the cheek. If the tumour is simple this may be partly done with a periosteal elevator, the periosteum being saved Fig. 6S5.—Excision of Lower Jaw. Soft parts i-aised. Avhere it can be safely taken fi-om over the tumour. The knife is then caiTied behind the jaw in front of the tmnour separating the mylo-hyoid and diAuding the mucous membrane in the floor of the mouth, care being taken not to cut away the genio-hyoid and genio-hyoglossus muscles, unless the situation of the tumour is such that this cannot be avoided. If these muscles are necessarily divided, a thick ligature should be passed through the end of the tongue, which must be drawn forwards by an assistant, lest it fall backwards into the pharynx and thus threaten or even occasion suffocation, as has happened to Surgeons of eminence both in France and in America. The jaw having been cleared on both sides in front of the tumour, the incisor tooth must be drawn at the point where it is intended to divide the bone, and the saw (Fig. G80) applied. The section should be completed with the saw, as if the bone forceps be used a jagged edge will probably be left. The jaw is then seized either by the fingers or in the lion-forceps, and forcibly depressed and

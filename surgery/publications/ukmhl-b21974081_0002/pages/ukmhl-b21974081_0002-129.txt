97 OBLITERATION- OF ARTERIES. wJien bifurcatino: or friviiiu: oft' a lars>:e trunk. The source of the embolism ~ o o O I may be the Tegetatioiis formed upon the valves of the heart in acute rheu- matism or ulcerative endocarditis, the fibrin deposited in a pouch of a dilated aorta, or on a projecting calcareous plate, or a fragment of a clot projecting into the main trunk from a thrombosed branch, as in Fig. 439. The effects produced vary with the nature of the embolus and its size. AVhen derived ; from the vegetations on the valves in ulcerative endocarditis it may give rise to iuHammatiou and softening of the coat of the artery at the point at Avhich it lodges (see Eml)olic arteritis, p. 80), more commonly it leads merely to Fig. 4:j9.—Thrombosis of two of the chief branches of the abdominal aorta; projection of the thrombus into the main trunk.

If it dodge in a small artery in a part in Avhich the anastomosing circulation is free, it produces no effect beyond the permanent closure of the vessel ; if it lodges in a tenniiial artery, as in one of the abdominal viscera, it gives rise to the fonnation of a haemon’hagic infarct (Yol. 1., ]>. 9:57) followed by the sub- sequent degeneration, and shrinking of the affected area.

Compression of the aorta under prolonged anmsthcsia has of late years been found so successful, that in no case should a trial of it be omitted when pos- sible (see p. 22G). Should it tail, it becomes necessary to tie the vessel leading to the sac. In the majority of instances the tumour, though it may have encroached on the abdomen, will not have reached too high for the external iliac to be ligatured ; should it have done so, however, the Sm-geon may have to tie the common iliac artery; but in some instances even this may not be Fig. 488.—Ligature of the External Iliac hy Ahernethy’s Operation, modified. • practicable, and his choice must lie between the slender chance ofiered by constitutional treatment, and the fearful alternative of ligaturing the aorta. Ligature of the External Iliac Artery.—There are two modes of tying ■ the external iliac artery—the one origiiiiilly practised by Aberiiethy, consider- ably modified by Liston ; and the other introduced by Sir A. Cooper. AhermtJijfs modified mefhod (Fig. 488) on the right side consists in com- mencing an incision at a point about one inch above and the same distance internal to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, carrying it in a carved direction, with the convexity outwards, to a ]ioint about three-quarters cf an inch above and half-an-iiich external to the middle of roupart’s ligament. When the operation is on the left side the incision should be commenced below and canned iqiwards between the two points mentioned. The wound thus made is altogether external to the inguinal canal and to the line of the epi-

In removing it I was obliged to take away a piece of the expanded serratus as large as the hand. The patient made an excellent recovery, and experi- enced no difficulty in breathing afterwards. Saecomata of various kinds are- met with in the axilla (Fig. 781). Such tumours might, in their early stages, be dissected out; but if they extend high up to the clavicle, or implicate the skin widely by infiltration, they should, I think,' be left, as was necessaiy in the patient from whom Fig. 782 was taken, where the size of the tumour Fig. 7si.-sarcoma in Axilla of a Man. aiid its couiiections precluded the’ possibility of operation. Their re- moval cannot, indeed, at any stage, be undertaken without much danger. In dissections requisite for the extirpation of such masses, as in Fig. 781, I have had to expose the axillary and subscapular vessels and their accompanying nerves. The growth being usually somewhat widely disseminated, it is difli- cult to be certain that the Avhole is fairly extirpated : hence, recurrence is likely speedily to take place.

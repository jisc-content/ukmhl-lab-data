The return of the voice, more or less per- 1 fectly, when the outer oi)ening is closed, is usually a sign that the tube may I be safely removed. In rare cases there is much delay in getting rid of the r tube, owing to a pereistence of the laryngeal obstruction. This may be due I to adhesions in the larynx, which may be broken down by an instrument I passed upwards from the rvound. In other cases it seems to result from paralysis of the laryngeal muscles.

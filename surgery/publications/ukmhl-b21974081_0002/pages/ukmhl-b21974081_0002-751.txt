719 SEROUS AND HYDATID CYSTS. times be brownish or turbid, from the admixture of blood, and in some cases cholesterine is present. These cysts are usually single, sometimes they are loculated and in other cases multiple. They are usually about the size of a ■ filbert when first noticed, and may remain small for a great length of time, but in other cases they gradually increase until they may contain several ounces of fluid. They then become very tense, so much so in fact that fluctuation is no longer present. Unilocular cysts of the breast occasionally attain an immense size, at the same time that their walls remain thin and supple. In these cases the skin covering them may become thinned and translucent, constituting the condition which has been termed hydrocele of the breast. The simple serous cysts never develop intra-cystic groAvths. In some rare cases calcification of the cyst-wall has been observed. o. The true Hydatid Cyst is extremely rare, but has been met with in the \ ! Fig. 771.—Breast laid open after removal, showing Cysts deeply-seated in Mammary Gland, mistaken for Scirrhus. mamma. The simple serous cyst was described by Sir A. Cooper under this name. The Diaynosis of a cyst of the breast may usually be effected by feeling the globular elastic tumour under the skin ; the mammary gland being movable and not adherent to any of the adjacent structures. Cysts being connected with the mammary tissue drag upon the nipple when moved awav from it. This is recognized by holding the nipple lightly while the tumour is diwn away with the other hand, when the connection between them will be clearly percep- tible. Ill those cases, however, in which the tumour lies deejily, the diagnosis may not so readily lie made, more esjiecially from tiimoui’s containing cysts or cancer. In fact, nothing is more easy than to diagnose the true nature of a

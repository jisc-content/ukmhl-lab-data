i PERINEA L LIT HO TRITY—RESUL TS. 1009 i i j Fig. 903.—Perineal Lithotrity. Introduction of Dilator (Dolbeau). :I The operation itself is extremely simple. It consists of four stages : 1. The ^ making of an incision in the median line into the membranous portion of the j,;.rethra on a grooved staff; 2. The slow and gi’adual dilatation of the neck of jihe bladder by means of a six-bladcd “dilator ; ” 3. The introduction through bfce dilated neck of the bladder of the “ lithoclast,” a powerful forceps for >l?zing and breaking up the stone ; and the extraction of the fragments and t|! Iverized stone by means of small forceps and the scoop. ' .'M. Dolbeau gives yeiy minute du'ections for the proper performance of the f .'ious stages of the operation. They resolve themselves into the simple rules a moderate external incision, very slow and methodical dilatation of the ostatic urethra and vesical neck, and complete “fragmentation” of the cuius. rFrom our knowledge of what happens when a stone is accidentally broken the crush of the forceps during an ordinary lithotomy operation, we ould not entertain very sanguine \dews of the results of the same procedure li en purposely performed. The delay in extracting the broken fragments •/great—the bladder emptied of its urine contracts upon and is irritated ^ them, and the uncertainty and difficulty of clearing away all fragments means of forceps, scoop, and injections, are very considerable."'’ The ident is one that is justly dreaded and guarded against as far as possible the practical lithotomist. The results of perineal lithotrity do not appear hitherto to have n either very brilliant or even satisfactory. In thirty operations there were ! deaths, which, considering that at least four of the patients were under VOL. II, 3 T

ANEURISM. 138 tourniquet, much inconvenience resulted from want of attention to this parti- cular. The tendency to fretting of the skin is much lessened hy powdering the limb ; and the removal of the hairs by shaving diminishes materially Fig. 457.—Compressor for tlie Middle of the Thigh.

In order to keep up continuous pressure, and at the same time to prevent any one part of the skin from being injuriously galled, it is of very great consequence that two instruments should be used at the same time, so that when one is screwed down the other may be loose; these instruments need not be placed closely together. If the aneurism be in the ham, it will be sufficient for one (Fig. 458) to be applied to the groin, whilst the other (Fig. 457) is put upon the middle of the thigh (Fig. 459). In using the instrmnent, the great point, as Tufnell most properly remarks, is to control the circulation with the minimum of pressure. In order to do this, the first instru- ment should be screwed down so that all pulsation ceases in the tumour, but still not so tightly as completely to arrest all the flow of blood through it. As the pressure exercised by this becomes painful, the second one must be screwed tight, and then the first compressor may be slackened. In this way an alternation of pressure can be kept up without much pain or inconve- nience. If possible, the patient should be taught how to manage the instrument himself, and will often find occupation and amusement in doing so. If, however, it excite much pain or irritation, as it does in some Fig. 459.—Two Compressors applied for Femoro- popliteal Aneurism.

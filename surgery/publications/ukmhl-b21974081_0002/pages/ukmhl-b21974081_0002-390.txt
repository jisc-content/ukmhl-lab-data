358 DISEASES OF JOINTS. and anaemia, aloetics and the preparations of iron must be given ; if ovarian or uterine irritation or congestion exist, tliis must be removed by proper local means, and the general health attended to. Nervine antispasmodics and tonics, such as valerian and bark, or assafoetida and quinine in full doses, should be freely administered. The most efficient treatment that can be directed to the affected joint is the application of cold douches and the employment of the continuous electric current, which will cure cases in which all other means have failed; the application of atropine and aconite may be of service to allay the pain when especially severe. If contraction or other distortion of the limb exist, the patient should be put under anaesthetics, and extension or rectification of the faulty position then made, care being taken to keep the limb on splmts in a proper position for some time after the operation. Indeed, in neurotic or hysterical joint affections, it is often of much use to do something positive or objective in the way of treatment, so as to give the patient an excuse to get well. It is thus that free manipulation or slight “ wrenching ” of the joint under anaesthetics is often beneficial. In other cases the good effects following this treatment may be explained by the stretching and restoration of the normal position of muscles which had been allowed to become contracted and displaced by long continued fixity or faulty position of the joint. |. j- i I I (

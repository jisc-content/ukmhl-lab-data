If tthe umbilical flap be not of sufficient length, very troublesome flstulai arc apt to be left at its angles, requiring further plastic operations for their cure. Experience has shown that, if the operation be left at this stage, the benefit is ! not permanent. 'I'he contraction of the cicatrices, and the constant tendency to protnision of the mucous membrane of the bladder from beneath the new covering at the opening left at the root of the penis (Fig. 1)08), lead to a gradual increase in the size of the opening and a partial return of the symptoms. To prevent this, the fissured penis may be covered in by the following method. The

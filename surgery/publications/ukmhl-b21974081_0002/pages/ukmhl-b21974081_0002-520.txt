DISEASES OF SYEOVIAL MBMBIiANFS, AND OF MUSCLES. 488 hydatid cysts. Primary ‘carcinoma of muscle never occurs., Teevan collected with much industry the particulars of 02 cases of tumoui-s of muscles of all kinds ; about one-third of these were soft sarcomata, 10 were described as fibrous, 8 cystic, 5 hydatid, and 5 nasvoid. Malignant sarcomata are most common according to my experience in the lower limb. When the upper limbs are affected, the muscles that have, according to Teevan, been most frequently attacked are the pectoralis major, deltoid, and biceps. The muscles of the trunk and neck are seldom diseased, with the exception of the rectus abdominis, which appears to be very liable to tumours. Of twelve consecutive cases that I have had under my care in which tumours of different kinds developed primarily in muscular tissue, the following are the particulars. The first case was that of a woman about 48 years of age, in whom a fibro-cystic tumour, as large as a cocoa-nut, developed in connection with the tensor vaginm femoris, forming a large mass, which I dissected out readily from over the hip. The second case was that of a lad about 18, in Fig. 607.—Malignant Tumoui- in Sole. Fig. 608.—Section of Foot, showing situation of Tumour. whom a cystic tumour, as large as a foetal head, thick walled, and containing clear fluid, developed in the substance of the adductor brevis of the thigh, from which it was dissected out with no little difficulty, and with a fatal result. The third case was that of a man from whom the accompanying drawings are taken (Figs. 604, 605, 606), in whom a fibro-sarcoma developed within the sheath of and in the substance of the sartorius muscle of the left thigh, in consequence of a strain. After growing slowly for about six years, it had attained the size of a child’s head, when I removed it, together with seven or eight inches of the muscle from the inside of the sheath of which it had originated, and with

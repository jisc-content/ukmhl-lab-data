Immediately above the artery, and in close contact with it, is tlie lowest cord of the brachial plexus, that formed by the last cervical and first (hjrsal nerves ; l>eneath the ciiteiy is the hist lib, upon which it can be felt rolliin^ under the finder when firm pressure is made. At the same time pulsation will be felt, but tiiis must not be taken as proof that the structure beneath the finger is tlie vessel, for the lowest cord of the brachial idIcxus lies so close to the subcla\'ian artery that it receives a cominunicated pulsation from it. On firm pressure the nen'e still retains its round form, while the artery flattens out, and its surface becomes 1 r>.

The thick fascia covering the artery having been carefully opened with the edge of the knife, the needle is passed from the nerve, as low down as possible, so as to avoid any risk of injuring the pleura by slipping over the upper border of the first rib. The subclavian vein is so far below the clavicle that there is no possibility of wounding it. In a considerable proportion of cases the posterior scapular artery will be found springing fr-om the artery in this part of its course. In 290 arteries examined by Quain, it arose from the third part as a separate branch in 101, or as nearly as possible- one in three cases. If this condition is met with, the ligature must be applied as far as possible to the proximal side of the branch. If necessity obliges the ligature to be applied close to the branch, it is jierhaps safer to tie this also, as the anastomosis of the vessels in this region is so abundant that the risk of gangi’ene fr’om the obliteration of a single branch would be veiy small. ■

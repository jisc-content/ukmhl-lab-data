532 DEFORMITIES. 'i bones may be raised by the anterior half of the sole. Tn some of the slighter cases the instrument here represented (Fig. G40) may be used to obtain the e.Ytended position of the toes without division of the tendons. Fig. 649.—Apparatus for obtaining Extension of Toes without Division of Tendons. I I Contraction of One Toe is not of unfrequent occurrence. In this com- plaint the proximal phalanx is either on its normal level or slightly drawn up ; the two distal are bent down at an acute angle, the apex of which is formed by the articulation of the first with the second. This contraction more commonly affects the second toe, is often symmetrical in the two feet, and is frequently a source of great inconvenience, and even permanent lame- ness. It appears to be due to contraction of the digital prolongation of the plantar fascia, and is best remedied by dividing this subcutaneously opposite the lower part of the second phalanx, and then straightening the toe. Supernumerary and Webbed Toes are sometimes met with. It is com- paratively seldom, however, that any operative interference is re- quired in these cases. Should it be, the remarks that have been made at pages 509 and 510, in reference to the treatment of these conditions in the hand, are equally applicable here. Congenital Hypertrophy of the Toes and Foot, as repre- sented in Figs. 650 and 651, occasionally occurs. This mal- formation is of necessity in- Fig. 650.—Plantar Aspect. Fig. 651.—Dorsal Aspect. CUl’able. Weak Ankles not uncom- monly occur in rickety children; the ligaments being relaxed, the joints appearing to be swollen, and the child being unable to walk or stand without great difficulty. In these circumstances, attention to the state of the general health, douching with salt water, with the application of an elastic india- rubber bandage round the ankle, or the use of light iron supports, will lie found most useful. \ \ Congenital Hypertrophy of Toes and Foot.

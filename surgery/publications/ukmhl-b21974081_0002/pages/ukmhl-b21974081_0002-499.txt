MORTALITY AFTER EXCISION OF HIP. 467 by tlie finger, or by the handle of a scalpel, from the subjacent soft structures; and the muscles and fascue lining the pelvic bones, being thickened and infil- trated with inflammatory products, effectually protect the contained parts from all injury. Excision of the hip should be performed with antiseptic precautions when possible. If foul sinuses exist these may be scraped with a sharp spoon, and cleaned with a small sponge dipped in a solution of chloride of zinc, and held in a pair of sinus forceps. Some simple antiseptic dressing may then be applied, and the limb fixed with a long splint. Fergusson recommends that the extension should be made from the opposite thigh, round the upper part of which a socket is fixed, to which the band is attached (Fig. 592). Much advantage wiU be derived from the use of the bracketed thigh-splint, from which extension may be made by means of a Fig. 592.—Apparatus to be used after Excision of Hip-joint. weight. When the wound has partly healed, if the situation of the incision allows of it, a Thomas’s hip-splint may be applied and the patient allowed to move alxjut. Results.—The result of excision of the hip-joint has to be considered from two points of view :—1. As to the Mortality immediately referable to the opera- tion ; and 2. As to the Utility of the Limb that is left after its performance.

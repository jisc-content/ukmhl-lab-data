1204 DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS. Vienna) the displacement has been inguinal. In nearly one half of the cases it was congenital ; all these were instances of inguinal displacement; and all the instances of double ovarian hernia were inguinal and congenital. The Causes of the displacement in the adult are not easily ascertained. In the congenital cases it would seem as if an abnormal descent of the ovary took place, analogous to the descent of the testis in the male. Symjjtoms.—Congenital ovarian hernia is nearly ahvays irreducible ; while in most cases of acquired displacement of the ovary, it has been possible to return the tumour into the abdomen. The swelling is generally pyriform in the inguinal region, rounder in the femoral. There is no constant diagnostic symptom; but in several instances it has been noticed that the hernia became more tender on pressure, and larger, dmlng menstruation. At this time, also, inflammation of the ovary may take place ; and, being attended vrith vomiting, may lead the Surgeon to imagine that the case is one of strangulated hernia. The diagnosis here is not easy; indeed, according to Englisch, of twenty cases, in which symptoms of strangulated hernia were present, a correct diagnosis was made in seven only. The diflBculty of diagnosis would be much increased if an intestinal or omental hernia were present with the ovarian. Abscess or sloughing of the displaced ovary occasionally occurs. Treatment.—So long as the hernia presents no special symptoms there is little or no occasion for interference, beyond the wearing of a properly fitted truss. If inflammation occur, the case must be treated on ordinary principles; and if the ovaiy suppurate, the abscess should be opened. When the ovary is very painful, or has become cystic, extirpation may be practised.

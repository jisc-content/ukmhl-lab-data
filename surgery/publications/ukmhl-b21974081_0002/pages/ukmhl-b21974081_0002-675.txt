EXCISION OF CANCER OF TONGUE BY ECRASEUR. 643 i i^iiidaally tig'htened, and the tongue is cut or shaved off obliquely from behind forwards. Two ecraseurs were successfully used by Chassaiguac in removing portions of the tongue. When the disease occupies only one side, and it is not thought necessary to cut away the whole breadth of the organ, two instruments are required, which, as Chassaignac represents (Fig. 7;>1), must be passed through the substance of the tongue in opposite direc- tions, so as to isolate and detach the diseased j portion. The operation may, however, be I i)erformed much more rapidly and easily by : splitting the tongue in the middle line by means t of a knife or a pair of scissors. As Morrant 1 Baker has specially pointed out, an incision, if j made accurately in the middle line, is almost i bloodless. The incision can be safely carried I backwards as far as the root of the tongue, and ithe separation of the diseased half of the «organ and the application of the 6oraseur are much facilitated by so doing. The following points must be attended to in removing large portions of the Fig. 731.—Two Eci-aseiir-s applied to Cancer of Tongue. Fig. 733.—Galvanic ilci'a.seur. -nd require the ligature. The instrument should be worked very slowly, in '»rder that time may be given for the vessels to contract. As an additional ^ecurity against haamoiThage a strong ligature should be applied behind the craseiir just before it finally cuts tlirougli the lingual arterv. The wire ecraaeur (Fig. 732) will be found better than the chain-instrument, he form of wire best suited to the instrument is strong piano-wire. It will T T 2 : tongue by means of the ecraseur. The wire should be thick. If too thin it . cuts almost as readily as a knife, and the lingual arteries will certainly spout Jig. 732.—Wire Ecraseur for Removal of Tongue.

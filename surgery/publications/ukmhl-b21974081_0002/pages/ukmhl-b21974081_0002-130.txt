98 DISEASES OF ARTERTES. Ibrming wedgcd-shapecl buff-colonrcd patches of considerable toughness, are commonly met with in the spleen and kidneys in cases of advanced atlieroma or fusiform aneurism of the aorta, Wlien tlie embolus is large and lodges in a main trunk, as in the popliteal at its bifurcation, or in the axillary, spontaneous gangrene may result. This is the common source of gangrene in young people, and is probably the immediate cause of a certain proportion of cases of senile gangrene, the embolus in the latter case being derived from the diseased surface of an atheromatous aorta. The case from which the accompanying drawing (Fig. 440) was taken was that of a woman, 56 years of age, admitted for spontaneous gangrene of the left arm ; the embolus lodged in the axillary artery had caused gangrene of the limb. The figure illustrates also the thrombosis of the vessel below the part at Avhich the embolus has lodged, which frequently aids in the production of gangTene. Gradual narrowing of an artery, ending perhaps in complete obliteration, causes few or no symptoms when the area affected is limited in extent and the collateral circulation is sufficiently active to keep up the supply of blood to the parts beyond the obstruction. The gradual narrowing of a considerable extent of the main vessels of the limb, such as is seen frequently from calcare- ous degeneration of the tibial arteries, gives rise to more or less definite effects, such as cold feet, cramps, numbness, and weakness of the legs. Such symptoms are often the premonitory signs of gangrene (see Vol, I., p. 87G), and are an indication that care must be taken to keep the parts warm by appropriate clothing and to avoid any injury. The symptoms of embolism of a large trunk have been described already (Yol. I., p. 878).

6g8 OPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND CHEST. As it is of great importance in cases of hydrolhorax to exclude the air from the pleural sac the operation is now almost invariably performed by the aspirator. The original aspirator, as invented by Dienlafoy, slightly modified (Pig. 93, Vol. L, p. 238), will be found the most convenient instrument, iU5 it can be converted into a syphon at will. The ordinary bottle-aspirator (Fig. 7(!(I) will, however, usually answer the purpose well enough. The air having been exhausted from the bottle by means of the air-pump, and the stop-cock closed, the chest is tapped in the way to be presently described with the aspirator-trochar ; and the cock in its side being turned on, the fluid rushes into the exhausted bottle to fill up the vacuum. Other instruments also have been designed for the purpose of preventing Fig. 768.—Tapping the Clie.st by the Sji'Fon-Trochar. the entrance of air during the operation. Of these the two most efllciei^t aie the ‘‘‘‘pision-irochar’''' (Fig. 7(i7),or Thompson’s syphon-irochai (Fig. 7()8). If the “ piston-trochar ” (Fig. 7(57) be used the tap should be closed as t le

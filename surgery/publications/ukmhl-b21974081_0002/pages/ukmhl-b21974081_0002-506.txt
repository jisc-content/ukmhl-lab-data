474 DISEASE OF THE mP-JOJHT. section of the bone takes a few minutes, and is as much an act of filiii" as of sawing. The wound is then closed Ijy a pad, and the limb brought straight. Before this could be done in Adams’s first case, it was necessary to divide the long head of the rectus, the adductor longus, and the tensor vaginae femoris muscles. In performing this operation, as Adams justly ol)serves, it is of great importance for the Surgeon to bear in mind the altered direction of the shaft of the femur, which is usually adducted as well as flexed forwards, so that the division of the neck may be made at right angles to the axis of the bone and not obliquely, or in a direction more or less parallel to the shaft. After the operation in Adams’s first case, an endeavour was made by passive motion to get a false joint; but this being unsuccessful, the attempt was abandoned, and the limb allowed to ankylose in the straight position. Since this case. the operation has been repeated successfully by Adams and by many other ^^SnLr preferred a chisel to the saw in practising osteotomy of the neck of the femur, and had much success in the operation so performed. On comparing this operation with those which had preceded it, by Barton, Sayre, and others, there can be no doubt of its superior simp icity and safety ; and although it is perhaps less likely to be followed by mobility of limb t ^ when a piece of bone is cut out by Sayre’s method, yet it must be admitted that not only is a movable false joint of doubtful utility, but it seems to . been very difficult of establishment, so great is the tendency to bony ankylosis after these sections. . „ , Cross- or Scissor-legged Deformity is occasionally met with as the result

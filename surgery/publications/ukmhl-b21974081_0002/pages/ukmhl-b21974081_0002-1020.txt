988 URINARY CALCULUS AND LITHOTOMY. Dulles finds that the 8Ui)rai)iibic is far less lavourablc than the lateral in its results for calculi below in weight. For those between 5j. and Jij., there is little difference, whilst for calculi above 5'j., it is far more favourable. He states that, of a gross total of 405 cases of the suprapubic operation, in lx»th sexes there had been fo5 deaths, or a mortality of 1 in 3'44 ; the mortality being about 1 in 3 in males, against 1 in 8’2 in females. This high rate of mortality may to a certain extent be accounted for by the fact that the patients subjected to suprapubic lithotomy were on an average one-third older, and the stones four and a half times heavier, than in the cases subjected to the lateral operation. Dulles gives a table of 43 cases operated on by American Surgeons, of which 14 died, or as nearly as possible 1 in 3. This agrees with the statistics previously published by Humphry, who collected 104 cases in which this operation had been performed ; of these 31 proved fatal, chiefly from peritonitis and urinary infiltration—the mortality amounted consequently to 1 in 3|; and Souberbielle, one of the greatest modern advocates of this operation, lost 1 patient in 3. The general result, therefore, is not very satis- factory ; though, as in many instances the operation was performed in cases in which the lateral method was not applicable on account of the size of the stone, we cannot 'with justice compare the two procedures in regard to the mortality attending them.

1179 THE OPERATION OF CASTRATION. 3 I requiring ligature are usually the spermatic, the cremasteric, and the arteiy < ot the vas deferens. The spermatic artery will be found at its anterior part I the arteiy of the vas deferens behind, A\hen all the vessels are secured the tape or clamp must he removed. If the Surgeon has not a very reliable assistant it is safer to tie the cord as ii whole. This is done by passing a piece of strong carbolized silk under the cord, and tying the whole of this structure very tightly before dividing it. lu this way hmmorrhage is most effectually restrained; and the ligature separates about the eighth day, or may heal into the wound if cut short, , provided efficient antiseptic treatment is carried out. J n castration for tubercular testicle it is better to separate the vas deferens from the other constituents of the cord and to divide it separately. If it be found diseased it may be drawn down and a further piece removed in the hope of getting above the disease. A large number of vessels usually require ligature in the scrotum. All lileeding from this source must be very thoroughly arrested, otherwise the loose tissues of the scrotum may become distended with extravasated blood and very troublesome suppuration result. After the operation the wound must be accurately closed with sutures and a good-sized drainage-tube inserted ut its lower end. In cancer of the testicle, it is of great consequence to divide the cord a.s high up as possible, for obvious reasons. It will not, however, be safe to do this â€¢^jpposite the abdominal ring in the way that has just been described, as there would not be sufficient sj)ace for the assistant to hold the cord alx)ve the part to lx; divided. In cases of this kind, I have found it a good practice to expose the cord by dissection up to the abdominal ring ; then to draw it well

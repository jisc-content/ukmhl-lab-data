The Scalp is subject to all those surgical diseases that affect the common integument of the body. But it is more than any other part of the surface liable to two diseases, viz., Atheromatous Cysts and Naevi. These have already been so fully treated of (Cysts, p. 907, Vol. I. ; Neevi, p. 989, Yol. I., and p. 08, Vol. II.) that their description here would lead to needless repetition. Pachydermatous Tumour of the Scalp or Molluscum Fihrosum (Yol. I., p. 980). This disease, of extremely rare occurrence, was first described by John Bell. It was first named and fully described by Valentine !Mott as Pachydermatocele, more recently by Virchow as Fibroma Molluscum, The accompanying cut (Fig. 052), taken fi’om a patient whilst in iVmerica, who -was after- wards successfully operated on by N. Stokes, in Dublin, gives a good representation of the disease. These tumoui’s are neither pain- ful nor dangerous, but their weight and the deformity occasioned by them render their removal desir- able. Treatment.—The removal of this tumour may be effected by the ligature or the knife. Pollock has successfully extiqiated one by the former, W. Stokes bv the latter method. But the operation is not 052.—Pacliydennatous Tumour of Scalp. without danger. In Stokes’s case the haemorrhage was described as terrific, nearly costing the patient his life, and had to be annsted by the cautery. Stokes states that in the whole cfuirse of his experience he had never seen such copious and uncontrollable “ weeping ” haemorrhage; it came from every point of the cut surface. Pungus of the Dura Mater.—Sometimes without external or apparent cause, at other times in consequence of a blow or fall, a Funtjous Tumour grows from some j)art of the dura mater, usually on the top of the head or in one of the parietal regions. As it increases in size, it produces absorption of

In lithotomy the case is .ditferent ; for here the bladder is not only usually in a state of chronic irritation, but the kidneys are frequently diseased, and these conditions iutiuence the result of the ojier.itiou more materially than any other circum- stances. Hence an operator may have a run of unsuccessful cases ; or, by a fortunate concurrence of favourable cases, more particularly in children, it has >t)CcasionaIly hapijened that a Surgeon has cut 20 or 30 patients in succession without losing a single one ; but several deaths then occurring, though the )}'»eration was perfomied in the same TiA'ay and with the same care as before, his average has folleu to about the usual level. Green, at St. Thomas’s, cut 40 patients in succession, and lost only one. Lynn cut 25 patients for stone without losing one, and he said that he thought he had at last discovered the ‘^cret of performing lithotomy with success ; but, he added, the x\lmighty punished him for his presumption, for he lost the next 4 cases that he cut. i Bransby Coojxjr, of Guy’s, cut 30 patients in succession without a death, but then lost several, thus reducing the rate of mortality to the usual standard, liiston, during a period of six years, in which he operated 24 times, lost no i patient from lithotomy at University College Hospital ; but out of the whole 37 cases which he cut during the period of his connection ■with that insti- tution, there were 5 deaths ; reducing the average to 1 in 7'2. This success was, however, very great when it is taken into consideration that most of ;:hese cases occuiTed in adults, and that many of them were of a very serious M character. 1 find on reference to the Hospital Kecords, that only seven of the ^ .patients were under 10 years of age, Avhilst 14 were above 50 ; of these two f uvere 80 years of age, of whom 1 died and the other recovered. I believe that Liston lost only one patient under GO years of age, and that wns a lad of 18, in whom he found it necessary to divide the right side of the prostate as well as the left, and who died of infiltration of urine. Thirty-eight patients successively operated on at the Norwich Hospital, recovered, but the average rate of mortality in that Institution, calculated from 871 cases, has been 1 in 7'50. The accompanying Table gives much valuable information on the rate of mortality after lateral lithotomy at different ages. It may be taken as a fair :ixample of successful English practice in this operation. ■’ABLK OF PATIENTS OX WHOM LATERAL LITHOTOMY WAS PIIRFORMED AT THE NORFOLK ANU NORWICH HOSPITAL FROM JANUARY, 1772, TO DECEMBER, 1S69.

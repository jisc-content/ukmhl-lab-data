49 LYMPUADENOMA. LYMPHADENOMA. This disease has been already described in the Chapter on Tumours (Vol. I., p. 991), and but little remains to be said concerning it. When the disease is limited to the lymphatic glands, the cpiestion of their removal often comes before the Surgeon. If the tumour be large and single, or composed of an agglomeration of multiple masses, and so situated that it can be taken out with safety, its removal is proper, and should be practised. I have several times removed large Ijunphadenomata from the axilla and upper part of the neck with great advantage. Even when the disease is multiple, single large masses that are sources of special trouble should be dissected out. In one such case a tumour, which was as large as a fist, was removed, in University College Hospital, from the axilla. The patient, a delicate woman, had a group of similar growths in the neck, which had remained stationary for twenty years. The operation should not be undertaken when the patient is very weak or aiuemic, and more especially when there is persistent elevation of temperature. Fig. 423.—Lymphadenoma of Glands at Boot of the Neck. The accompanying figure (Fig. 42:1) from a patient under the care of Christopher Heath is a good illustration of the appearances produced by this disease when affecting the glands at the root of the neck. With the exception of lymphadenoma, the lymphatic glands are singularly exempt from the growth of primary tumours. Round-cell sarcoma is said occasionally to be met with, but it is probable that some of the tumours formerly described under that name would now be classed as lymphadenomata. Secondary tumours are, however, extremely common. All forms of cancer tend to affect the glands at an early period of their gi’owth. Round-celled and melanotic sarcomata also frequently give rise to secondary tumours in the glands VOL. II. ° ■

AVA: the thurnh ia of equal importance to the riint of the liand: and the pre- wation of ita threr^ Ixmea ia aa much to Ixi oonaid/ire^l aa thiat of the remaining Umn that enter inhj the confonnation of the metacarpua and fingera. In f;aaea of injury or dia<^aae implicating the thumb, every effort ought to lx; xJe for ita pre»x;n'ation. Even if it lx.* left atiff'ene^l and incajxihle of flexion, will l>e a nifxjt uaeful opfxment to the reat of the liand. Should it be found ieaaary to ahorten it, care muat lx; talom that aa little curtailment as poaaihle practiae^l: a fxjrtion of a plialanx, or ita metacarpal Ixjne even, is of esaential lity in giving strength and hrea^lth to the graap of the hand. In case* of ease, a very uaeful memlx;r may he left by the removal of a portion or the ole of the ungual plialanx, of the metacarfx>-phalangeal articTilation, or even the excision of the metacarpal Ixme, the phalange* being left. These various rations are easy of fxjrfonriamx;; an incision through the diseased and dis- I anised soft parts will expose the necnised bone or carious joint, which must removdi by cTitting-pliera or a narrow saw. IVhen the thurnh has lieen forced Ixick, or badly lacerated hy powder-flask gun-barrel expkisiona, it may often be saved by Ix^ing replaced and main- led in position on a splint, with some form of antiseptic drejwing applied it; and, should amputation lx; required, it must be done in accordance h the rule just mentioned—of saving as much aa possible of the injured t. I f I I I n the conservative surgery of the Fingers the preservation of flexion and enaion in the jiart left is the main thing to be aimed at; a rigid stump is ays in the way. I’lie pre*i;rvation of these movements beoimes more im- tant in profxirtion as the palm is approached. It is of more consequence t the proximal phalanx, which carric-s the rest with it, should lx; cajxihle of ng bent inUi the [lalrn, than that the distal can be flexwl on the second If proximal phalanx can lx; lx;nt down, a very small degree of movement in disul one will be sufficient to furnish pliability enough in the finger to

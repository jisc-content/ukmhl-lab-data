COMPLETE EXCISION' OF THE UPPER JAW. S9I ^ the orbit is reached (Fig*. G83); the soft parts arc then carefully separated |i from the floor of this cavity, and drawn upwards by a curved copper spatula, j which protects them and the globe of the eye. j Or the line of incision by external flap (Fig. G84) may be adopted in the i following way. The point of the knife is entered opposite the inner angle of I the eye, and carried doAvu the side of the nose, round the ala, and through the centre of the upper lip. Another incision is now made in a horizontal direction I below the orbit, by entering the point of the knife where the first incision i I commenced, and carrying it directly outwards in the line of junction of the lower eyelid with the cheek, along the edge of the orbit as far as the zygoma. The flap thus formed is thrown outAvards. This line of incision has the great advantage OA^er the one represented in Fig. G84, that the arteries and nerves of the face are cut near their termi- nations, and not through their larger branches. This line of incision, to AA'hich €. Heath gives the preference, is most suit- able to all tumours of ordinary size. The next step in the operation consists in the diA'ision of the bones. This is best done Avith a jaAv-saAv and strong cutting pliers. The central incisor tooth is first extracted on the side on AA'hich the jaAV is to be removed. The jaAV-saAv (Fig. G80) is then pushed into the nostril parallel to the hard palate. Its point must not be directed upAvards for fear of injuring the cribriform plate. The saAv is then carried through the alveolar border and the palate processes of the superior maxilla and palate bones, cutting through the alveolus of the incisor that has been extracted. Ho incision must be made Avith a knife through ^ ,, r, , 1 1 1 T . 6S4.—Line of Incision in Excision of the soft structures ot the hard palate, as the upper Jaw l»y External Flap, they are diA'ided readily and Avith less hsemon-hage by the saAv. Care must be taken not to sraa^ so far as to injure the soft palate. A smaller saAA' is then taken, and the nasal process divided at the level of the loAver margin of the orbit, so that the posterior extremity of the incision shall correspond to the line of the articulation betAveen the superior maxillary and the ethmoid bones. The saAV is then carried through the malar bone in such a direction as to reach the anterior extremity of the spheno-maxillaiy fissure. If the tumour implicates the malar bone extensiA-ely, the zygoma must lie divided and another saAV cut earned from the spheno-maxillary fissure througli the frontal process of the malar bone. The cutting-pliers are noAv applied first to the malar bone and next to the nasal process. One blade of the bone-forceps (tlie flat side being directed to the sound bone) is then put into the nose, the other in tlie mouth in the line of the saAv-cut already made. As the blades are closed the Avedge-like action of the forceps forces the bone outAvards and fractures its jiostcrior attachments. Fnless the bony structures are extensively destroyed by the tumour, the line of fracture runs across the ascending process of the palate bone and the middle

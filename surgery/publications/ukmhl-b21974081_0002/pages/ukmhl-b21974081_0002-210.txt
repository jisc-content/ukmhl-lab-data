Disorganization j of right eye : j recovery. i After a careful examination of this subject, I think we are warranted i coming to the following conclusions. 1. Ligature of one carotid artery i followed by cerebral disturbance in more than one-fourth of the cases, abov one-half which are fatal. 2. When the two carotids are ligatured luith a interval of some days or weeks, the operation is not more frequently followe by cerebral disturbance than when only one is tied. 3. Pathological invcsti gation has shown that, if the vessels be gradually and successively obliterated the patient may live, although one carotid and one of the vertebral arterie have been occluded by disease and the other carotid ligatured, as in a cas related by Rossi. 4. As in a case recorded by Davy, an individual may eve live for a considerable time, though both carotids and both vertebrals b occluded—the cerebral circulation being maintained through the medium of th anastomoses of the inferior and superior thyroids and the deep cervical wit the occipital artery. 5. The reason why more or less extensi^•e obstruction b

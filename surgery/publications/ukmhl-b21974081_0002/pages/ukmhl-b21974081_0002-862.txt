The colon below the stricture was contracted, and entirely empty. On opening the thorax, the loop of intestine, foiu’teen inches in length. Fig. 801.—Diaphragmatic Hernia of Colon. of a pale slate-colour, and distended with gas, was found in the left pleural sac. It reached as high as the fifth rib, touched the pericardium, and was overlapped by the free margin of the left lung. Where strangulated, it was of a darker colour than elsewhere. The opening in the diaphragm, through which it had passed, admitted little more than the point of the forefinger, and had a thin tendinous margin. The tenth and eleventh ribs, on the left side, were found to have been fractured ; the latter was united by bone, but the tenth rib, at the seat of fractm’e, had formed a false joint. Connected with this and with the intercostal space below it, was a firm adhesion about an inch broad and an inch and a half long, united by its other extremity to the protruded meso- colon and the diaphragm. The protruded meso-colon was firmly adlierent to the upper surface of the diaphragm, close to the opening in it. The lungs were tolerably healthy. The right pleura contained three ounces, and the left eight ounces of serum.

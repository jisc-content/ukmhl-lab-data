DEFORMITIES. 490 CHAPTER LIV. DEFORMITIES. LATEEAL CUEVATUEE OF THE SPINE. This affection, on account of the frequency of its occurrence, the deformity it occasions, the tediousness and uncertainty of its cure, has received a good deal of attention from various Surgeons ; and much has been written on it by those who have specially devoted themselves to its treatment; yet the whole of its pathology and management lie in a very narrow compass. Lateral curvature of the spine most commonly commences at an early period of life, usually between the ages of twelve and eighteen—seldom before the one, and not very commonly after the other. Grirls are most frequently the subjects of this deformity, which but rarely occurs in boys. It appears to consist simply in a relaxation of the muscles and ligaments of the spine; in conse- quence of which the vertebral column, being no longer able to support the weight of the head, neck, and shoulders, becomes curved to one side, Fig. 609.—Lateral Curvature and Rotation of Si)ine.

The first curve usually takes place in the | 'i upper or middle dorsal region, the convexity tending towards the right side ; | I the second, or compensating cm’ve, occurs in the lumbar region, the convexity j looking towards the left. In some instances there is a quadruple curve (Fig. Gil). At the same time that these lateral curves take place, there is , \

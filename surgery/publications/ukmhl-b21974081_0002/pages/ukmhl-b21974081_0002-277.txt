LIGATURE OF THE SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL. 245 I merits ; the muscular fibres of the sartorius now come into view. If the incision have been made too far inwards it is possible that the adductor longus may be exposed instead of the sartorius ; the error is readily recognizied by observing the direction of the fibres, those of the adductor being downwards and outwards, and those of the sartorius downwards and inwards. The edges of the wound in the fascia being held apart with blunt hooks, the sartorius is seized in the forceps and drawn outwards, the fibres of the areolar tissue surrounding it being touched Avith the edge of the scalpel, if necessary, until its inner edge comes into view. If the operation be performed a little higher than usual, or if the sartorius be feebly developed, its inner edge may come into A’iew as soon as the fascia lata is divided. The edge having been found, the muscle must be turned outAvards and held on one side with a copper spatula. A little loose areolar tissue must then 1x3 cleared aAvay from beneath it with the handle of the scaljAel, and the sheath of the vessels comes clearly into vicAv. ddic sheath must be ciautiously opened, a small hole being made in it as in the diagram (Fig. 402). It must bo remembered that after the fascial sheath common to the artery and vein has been rig. vx*.—Diagnimof the opened, there is still the ])i’oper sheath of the artery to be divided before the ligature can be safely ])asscd.

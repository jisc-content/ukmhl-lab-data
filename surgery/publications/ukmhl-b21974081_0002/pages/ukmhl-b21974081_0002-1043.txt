3 T 2 ITIIOTOMY AND LITHOTRITY COMPARED—STATISTICS. lOI I iimanity be preferred to lithotomy. Probably about four-fifths of all eases stone occurring in the adult are ])ropcr for lithotrity, and the proportion ould be much greater if the patients applied earlier for relief, or il, instead F being subjected to medical treatment, they were at once put under proper irgical (‘are, and the stone detected, ■ Statistics.—The statistics cannot represent the true state of the question fiir as a general comparison between the operations is concerned. For it list Ije borne in mind that those cases that are lithotrized have invariably •en picked; whilst lithotomy has been performed on almost all patients discriminately as they have presented themselves. For lithotrity to be suc- ssfully done, it is necessary that the stone be of moderate size, and that the inary organs be in a healthy state and free from irritation : and this is the ite in which most of the cases have been, in which crushing has been done. ■ lithotomy cases, on the other hand, the Surgeon has had to contend with the difficulties of large or multiple calculi, diseased bladders, and bad con- tutioiis. Hence, in comparing the statistics of the results of lithotrity with ose of lithotomy, Ave compare the statistics of the results of operations per- ..ned under the most favourable circumstances on a series of selected cases, th those of cases taken indiscriminately and often presenting most unfavour- •le conditions. .'As Sir Henry Thompson has recently pointed out in his admirable course of ctures, delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons, the only method by tich we can ascertain the effect of lithotrity in reducing the mortality from •ne in the bladder, is to contrast the results obtained, when lithotomy was i sole operation practised, Avith those of the present day, when lithotrity has come the rule and the cutting operation the exception. For this purpose contrasts the statistics of three periods ; first, Avhen lithotomy only was formed; secondly, the transitional period from 1835 to between 1860 and HO, when about an equal number of cases Avere submitted to each operation ; 11 lastly, the modern period, Avhen lithotomy has been the exception. For first period he selects the statistics of the Xorwich Hospital from 1770 to >0, as published by Crosse, During that time 704 patients of all ages were .rated on for stone ; of these, 35 Avere females, of whom 2 died ; 243 were !• les under 20, of AA’hom 27, or 8 per cent., died. The remaining 326 were lit males, and of these 64 died, or 20 per cent. Of the adult males, 75 e over 60, and of these 22, or 29'3 per cent., died. These correspond y closely to the larger statistics collected by Thompson, including 1827 .otomies. Of these 1028 Avere on patients from 1 year of age to 16 lusive ; of these 68 died, or GMi per cent.; 528 betAveen 17 and 58, Avith deaths, or 16 per cent. ; and 271 betAveen 51) and 81, Avith 75 deaths, or H per cent. p’or the second period Thompson gives the statistics of Keith, of Aberdeen, Sir AVilliam Fergusson. Keith operated upon 304 cases of all ages ; 4 e females, none of Avhom died ; 23 were children ; 11) Avere submitted to otomy, and 4 to lithotrity, Avith 1 death. The remaining 277 Avcrc male ' Its ; of these 161 Avere cut, Avith 38 deaths, or 24 jier cent.; 116 Avere sub- ted to lithotrity, Avith 7 deaths, or 6 per cent. The total death-rate amongst e adults wa.s, therefore, 1 in 6|, or 15 per cent. Fergnsson’s cases amounted 171, including 52 children, all cut, Avith 2 deaths, or 4 per cent. The re- ning 21!) AA'ere male adults ; of these 110 Avere cut, Avith 33 deaths, or 30

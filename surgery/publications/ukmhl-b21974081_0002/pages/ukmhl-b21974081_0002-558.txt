526 DEFORMITIES. ^riiu l)ost way to avoid' this A'essel is, as d^impliii recommends, to puncture the sheath witli a sharp tenotome introduced close to tlie tiln'a, immediately above the malleolus. In the adult or young’ children past the age of infancy a small point of bone can be felt in this situation, whieji maiis the ui)per limit of the groove in the malleolus in wliich the tendon lies. ^J’he puncture should be made above this, otherwise the knife cannot be passed under the tendon. ^ After the sheath has thus been opened by a puncture, a blunt teno- tome is introduced, care being taken not to use so much force as to push it Fig. C4o.—Relation of Tendons divided in Eiiuino-Varus.

The tendon is then divided in the usual way. If the operation be performed too high up the limb, the flexor longus digitorum will be divided with the tendon of the tibialis posticus, but this is a matter of little moment. Unless great care be taken in cutting through the tendo Aehillis, there is also some risk of wounding the artery; as, in bad cases of varus, these two structures lie close together, the tendo Aehillis being drawn out of the median line towards the inner ankle. Indeed, in one instance I have seen the posterior tibial artery punctured during the division of this tendon, or rather in an attempt to divide some tense bands that lay beneath it; the bleeding, which was very free and in a full jet, was however, nuidily stopped by pressure, no bad consequences resulting.

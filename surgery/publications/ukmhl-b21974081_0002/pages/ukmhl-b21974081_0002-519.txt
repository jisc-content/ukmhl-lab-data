INFLAMMATIONS AND TUMOURS OF MUSCLES. 487 pyjcmia. Abscesses, as vre have already seen in psoas abscess, may enter the sheaths of muscles and cause considerable destruction of tissue. “ Rheumatic inflammation ” of muscles is met with as lumbago, intercostal rheumatism, &c., but of the exact nature of the process we know but little. SypMlitic Disease of Muscles has been already described (Vol. I., p. 1118). It occurs as diffuse sclerosis of the muscle or gummata. Gummata have been met with in the triceps, vastus externus, sterno-mastoid, and many other muscles, but especially in those of the tongue. They grow slowly, infiltrate suiTounding parts and soften if not relieved by treatment. They Fig. 605.—Back View of Tumour, sliowing Sartorius Fig. 606.—Front View of Tumour, laid open Muscle. and sliowing Sartorius, a. are not unfrequently multiple. They are accompanied by aching pain, and stiffness of the affected muscle. They derive their importance chiefly from their resemblance to some of the tumours to be immediately described, which has occasionally led to their being cut out. The diagnosis is effected by the history of syphilis, the slow growth and hardness of the tumour, its subsequent softening, and the pain at night. They disappear or diminish rapidly under iodide of potassium. Tumours of Muscle.—Primary tumours of muscle are not common. The growths met with arc the various forms of sarcoma, sometimes containing much fibrous tissue (fibro-sarcoma), sometimes soft (round-celled or spindle- celled sarcoma), chondromata, myxomata, fibromata, nmvoid growths, and

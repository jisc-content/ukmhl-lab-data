622 PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE FACE AND MOUTH oil each side of the chin ; and another incision, c D, upwards and outwards parallel to, and corresponding in length to, A b. The flaps formed by these incisions are represented in Fig. 714. They are detached from their subjacent connections; and the Avhole is raised upwards, so that the curved incision, a b, Fig. 713.

Buchanan’s Operation for the Restoration of the Lower Lip. comes into a horizontal line, and is made to constitute the margin of the new lip ; the secondary incisions, b c, coming together in a vertical direction, iu which they are retained by twisted and interrupted sutures (Fig. 715). Syme recommended a somewhat different mode of operating. Instead of the incisions c d being made, those marked b c are carried onwards for some distance in a direction curving downwards and outwards, so that they ter- minated below the angles of the jaw. The flaps so formed are raised and united in the middle line, as in Buchanan’s operation, the A-shaped portion Fig. 716.—Sjune’s metliocl of restoring the Lower Lip. Lines of Incision.

The long curved incisions enable this to be done by merely stretching the convex edges of the flaps, without sufficiently displacing them to prevent their readily meeting the concave edges of intervening skin, and being united to them by sutures. ISTo surface is therefore left to granu- late, and the whole wound heals by the first intention. In performing this operation it is essential to success that the incisions should be sufficiently free, so that the flaps may be brought into position without tension. If the chin be removed as well as the lower lip, it becomes very difficult to restore the loss, as there is no fixed point below to support the new lip, which consequently tends to sink downwards.

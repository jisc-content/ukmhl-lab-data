The urine is liable to deposit Yarions solid matters, Avhioh Avheii impalpable are termed Sediments; Avhen in fine gritty particles, Gravel; and Avhcii forming a larger concrete mass, Calculus or Stone. These deposits may be the result of constitutional abnormality, and the conditions gHing rise to them are then sometimes termed a Diathesis. Much importance was formerly ascribed to these so-called diatheses, as it was believed that there was some definite constitutional condition corresponding to each form of urinary deposit; but this view can no longer be maintained. Uric or Lithic Acid Deposits.â€”These occur in two fonns, as free uric acid and as urates. Free uric acid, in the form of crystals, is never met Avith in healthy urine. When it forms a deposit it apjDears as small red grains Avhich may be compared in general appearance to cayenne pepper. Under the microscope it is found to be crystalline. The fonn of the crystals varies considerably ; most commonly they appear as smooth, trans- parent, rhomboidal plates, mixed Avith Avhich may be diamond-shaj)ed, prismatic, or needle-shaped crystals. Occasionally they are barrel-shaped (Fig. 824). As a rule they are darkly stained with urinary pigment and present a reddish colour, but the tint varies greatly in difierent cases. The crystals are readily soluble in dilute solutions of potash or soda. Urates form the common pale yelloAv or reddish-yelloAV deposit AA'hich is so frequently observed to form as urine cools after being passed. This deposit, often termed Jateritious, is amorphous, and has no very definite chemical com- position, consisting of uric acid, combiued with soda, potash, and ammonia in

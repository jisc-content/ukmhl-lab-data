In the statistics (ndlected by Sir Henry lornfsion from the chief hospitals of this rymntry, he shows that one-third of ; entire nuinls.-r of cas^,*s occurred before seven years of age, and one-half 'ore the thirteenth y<;ar is fy^rnpleted. Couls^m has collected 2,072 recorde^l tes of lithotomy from various s/^urces ; of these, 1,4CG occurred under the ; of ten, lAl from eleven to twenty, 200 from twef»ty-one to thirty, 204 ra thirty-one to fifty, and JJOO from fifty-<me upwards.

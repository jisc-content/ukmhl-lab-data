The next class of cases of contracted knee that we have to consider is that in which the Hamstrings are Contracted, either alone or in addition to those results of chronic inflammatory action within the joint that have just been described. In these cases the hamstrings will be found to be tight; and, in proportion as the leg is extended on the thigh, they vdll become more tense, until at last all further extension is resisted, apparently by their traction, and not by any sudden check or stop within the joint itself. Division of the Hamstring Tendons is in ordinary cases as simple an operation as any in surgery, unattended by any difficulty, provided the Surgeon introduce the tenotome close to the side of the tendon to be divided, and cut in a direction from the popliteal aspect towards the skin. The outer ham- string will usually be found to be the most tense, and should first be divided. In doing this, the peroneal nerve might appear to be in clanger ; but this may

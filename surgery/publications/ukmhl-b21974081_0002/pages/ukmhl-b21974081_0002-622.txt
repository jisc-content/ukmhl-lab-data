The parts to be removed must be fairly exposed by raising a flap from the cheek. This may be fashioned in various ways (see Figs. 081, 683, 684). The following, which is the method adopted by Liston, will occasionally be found to be convenient Avhere the tumour is very large (Fig. 681). In the first stage, the central incisor tooth on the diseased side having been extracted, the point of a bistoury is entered opposite the external angular pro- cess of the frontal bone, and carried with a semicircular sweep into the angle of the mouth. From the upper end of this incision, a cut about one inch in length may be carried along the zygoma. Another incision is made from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, down to the side of the nose, round the ala, which it detaches, and through the centre of the upper lip into the mouth.

If tlie ordinary litliotritc l)e employed, tlie Lreakiin^ should not be effected by suddenly and forcibly screwiiifr up the instrument ‘ but the screw should be gradually worked by a series of short and shai-p turus’ • so as to constitute almost percussive movements (Fig. 885). In this way the ^ calculus ]s generally made to crumble down, rather than to fly asunder - and '■ as it yields, the screw must be worked tightly home. The blades of the -^ instrument may then be opened again, a fragment of the broken calculus seized and crushed in the same way as before ; and thus the complete disiiite- ' gration of the stone is gradually effected. j Before withdrawing the lithotrite, the Surgeon must be careful to see, by i the scale on the handle, that the male blade is well home. If this be not theJi Fig. 8S5.—Position of Hands in using Tliumb-screw Lithotrite.

It was formerly considered of the greatest moment that too much time should not be consumed at one sitting. The rule enforced before 1878 was that the shorter the sittings, the more likely was the case to do well. The first sitting was not to exceed four minutes, and the subsequent ones were to be as short as possible. In the repetition of the sittings, the Surgeon was guided by the effect produced on the stone and on the bladder. The calculus was often entirely Fig. 884.—Position of Hand in using Civiale’s Lithotrite.

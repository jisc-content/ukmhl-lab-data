ANEURISM. 142 subclavian, and axillary arteries, it is j^enerally not so applicable ; although, as we have already seen, aneurisms in the groin have been cured by compression ot the abdominal aorta, or of the iliac artery. Spontaneous aneurism is extremely rare in the upper extremity ; and, as the traumatic forms of the disease which occur here generally require that the sac should be laid open, it is seldom found necessary to have recourse to it in this part of the body, though it may be and has been successfully applied to the brachial artery. The great question with regard to compression appears, after all, to be whether it possesses any special advantages over the ligature, in the treatment of those aneurisms in which its employment is practicable. The principal objections that have been urged against compression are, that its employment is more painful and tedious than the use of the ligature ; and that those cases that are unpromising to the ligature, or that require amputation rather than deligation of the artery, are equally unfavourable to compression, and cannot be saved by its employment. To these objections it may with justice be answered that the pain attendant on the employment of compression depends very greatly upon the skill and care with which the apparatus is applied and managed throughout, as well as upon the kind of instrument used, being certainly much diminished when Carteâ€™s elastic compressor is employed ; and that, as has already been shown, the pain may be overcome by the use of anaesthetics. With regard to the relative tediousness of the treatment under the two plans, it would appear that in reality there is but little diiference ; for although some cases, in which compression is used, are prolonged over a considerable space of time, yet they do not occupy more than is often consumed when accidents of various kinds follow the use of the ligature ; and it not unfrequently happens in com- pression, but can never occur after the employment of the ligature, that the patient is cured of his disease in a few hours or days. Taking, however, the averages, we find that in the Dublin cases the treatment lasted twenty-five days, and in the London cases collected by Hutchinson but nineteen, and this is not very different to what formerly happened when silk ligatures were applied so as to cut through the artery and be finally mthdrawn from the wound ; for of fifty-four cases recorded by Crisp in which the femoral artery was tied, the average time for separation of the ligature was eighteen days, and if to this a week more were added for the closure of the wound, and for the treatment of the various accidents that often accompanied and followed ligature, we should probably be within the mark, and yet only bring the duration of the treatment by the two methods to the same level. In the present day, however, ligatures which are either absorbable, or are intended to become enclosed in the wound, are almost universally employed; and, as with the improved methods of treating wounds, union by first intention, or within ten days, is the rule, the treatment by ligature has come to be the more speedy mode of cure. Surgeons will, however, be eventually guided in their estimate of the value of these two plans, not so much by the question of submitting their patients to a slightly more painful or tedious treatment, as by the comparative risk of life attendant upon one or other method. Upon this point statistics have yet to be made ; partly because the unsuccessful cases of ligature have not been so commonly published as the successful ones, and paiiily because sufficient time has hardly yet elapsed since the general adoption of absorbable ligatures and of antiseptic treatment to enable us to form a correct conclusion as to the

7o6 OPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND CHEST. to use is one such as is represented in Fig. 93, as needles of sucli small size are apt to bo plugged with small flakes of lymph, and if such an accident occur, they may be cleared again by reversing the syringe and forcing a small quantity of fluid back into the pericardium. Before using the aspirator, it ' should be carefully tested with some carbolized water to render it aneptic, and - to see that the needle is pervious, and the whole apparatus in working order. A vacuum having been created in the aspiratoi’ by drawing back and fixing the piston, the needle is to be inserted at the spot determined on. As soon as | the opening at the point of the needle is covered, the stop-cock leading to it ■ is to be opened, so that the vacuum extends into the needle; and “ we now advance, vacuum in hand, in search of the effusion.” The needle must Ije pushed slowly and carefully onwards in a direction upwards and inwards till ; the fluid appears in the glass tube of the aspirator. The moment this occurs i all movement of the needle must cease, and it must be held steadily as long as i the fluid continues to flow. Any unnecessary movement may scratch and | injure the surface of the heart. If the flow cease suddenly, as if from some | obstruction, a little fluid may be forced back as above stated, to clear the | needle. After withdrawing the needle no dressing is required to the minute puncture. Over a pint of fluid has been removed by this means at one operation. In inserting the needle, care must be taken not to force it through a costal cartilage, or a small plug of cartilage may be cut out which would effectually close its canal.

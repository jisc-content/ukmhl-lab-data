If merely the siibmaxillary lym- phatic glands are enlarged, they should be fully exposed by a curved incision canled from near the symphysis to the level of the hyoid bone and back to the edge of the sterno-mastoid. The facial artery and vein will probably be divided, and sometimes it is necessary to remove the submaxillary gland which may be implicated by extension from the neighbouring lymphatic glands. A gland must be sought for also between the genio-hyoid itself and been removed, and this not till three or four years after tlie opera- tion. In these cases the tumour was probably a fresh primary growth. When the glands are enlarged, the advisability of operating will depend upon the extent of the glandular implication. It must be remembered that the internal organs are affected in epithelioma only in exceptional cases, and thus we may hope occasionally to cure the patient permanently even after Fig. 0<J3.—Epithelioma of Lower Lip : Lines of Incision.

If enlarged glands can be felt beneath the sterno-mastoid, it is lietter not to operate, as these can seldom be safely removed owing to their adhesion to the carotid sheath. If the glands are extensively adherent to the skin, then no operation should be attempted. Opcralim.—When once the true nature of the disease has been ascertained, the operation should be performed with as little delay as possible ; but before it is done, it is well that any veiy prominent or broken tooth should be removed, and the tartar cleaned away from the incisors. 'Jdie operation requires to be somewhat modified, according to the situation and extent of the affection (Fig. OOP,). If this be tolerably limited, a cut, e.xtending widely round it.

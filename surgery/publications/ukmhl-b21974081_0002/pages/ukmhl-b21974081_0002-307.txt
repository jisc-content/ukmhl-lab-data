275 TREPHIFING FOR CHRONIC ABSCESS. discliarge of an abscess in the soft parts, it becomes necessary for the Surgeon to open np a vent for the pus. This may be clone either by linear osteotomy or by the trephine. In some cases simple linear osteotomy, as described at p. 272, may be practised ; but should the bone be much thickened and the osseous structures greatly indurated, the trephine is the best instrument to use for opening the abscess. The proper way of doing this has been pointed out by Quesnay and Brodie. It consists in trephining the bone, so as to make an aperture for the exit of the pus. So soon as a vent has been given to the pus, Avhich is usually cheesy, the patient will experience great and permanent relief. In performing this operation, there are several points that deserve special attention. The limb having been made bloodless by Esmarch’s method, the bone must be exposed by a T- or V-shaped incision, made over the spot which has been foimd to be uniformly tender on pressure : and to this the trephine should be applied. The trephine should have a small and deep crown m 9 I It Fig. 501.—Bone Trephine.

When the trephine has penetrated to a sufficient depth, the button of bone may be removed by means of an elevator ; but care should be taken not to perforate the whole thickness of the bone! The diseased cavity will very commonly at once be opened in this way, a small

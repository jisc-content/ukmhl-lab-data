43 ELEPlIANTIxiSIS OF LEGS AND SGR0TU2L The glands, as Virchow and Rindfleisch suppose, hccome impervious to the transmission of lymph, and the hyperplastic deposits that characterize the disease are, together with the general stretching and hypertrophy of the integiimental strueture, the consequence of the plastic effusion into the areolar tissue. Treatment.—When this disease attacks the face, little, if anything, avails in the way of treatment. When it affects the labia and scrotum, the enlarged Fig. 422.—^West Indian Elephantiasis. and diseased part must be removed (See Diseases of Penis and Scrotum). But when the leg is affected, surgery can effect much in the way of cure. In the slighter cases much may be done by elevation of the limb, methodical bandaging, and perhaps, as Payer and Lisfranc recommend, the employment of scarification. But in the more severe cases, where the limb has swollen to a monstrous size, and has become shapeless from the groin to the ankle, the skin sallow, covered with nodules and overlaid by branny desquamation, with a tendency to unhealthy and incurable ulcerations—in these advanced and serious cases, more active measures are necessary. Dufour seems to have been the first to propose diminution of the supply of arterial blood to the limb as a cure for this disease. This he effected by'com- pressing the femoral artery by means of a kind of truss, and was successful in four cases. This practice of compression has since been successfully followed by Hill, Cockle, Yanzetti, and others. To Camochan is due the merit of having recommended the ligature of the femoral artery as a means of cure in these cases ; and, in whatever way it acts, there can be no doubt of the excellent effects that have followed this method of treatment, little as it can be explained by the received pathological views of

296 INFLAMMATION OF BONE AND ITS EFFECTS. AYhcn the necrosis is central, the sequestrum being embedded in a new case or covered in by old bone, the operative procedures for its removal are of a more complicated character. The difficulties here consist in some cases in the depth from the surface, and in the obstacle offered to its passage by the soft parts ; in others, in the length and magnitude of the sequestrum in proportion to the small size of the cloacae, and in the manner in which it lies in a direction parallel to these openings. In cutting down upon the bone, the Fig. 508. • Fig. 509. Fig. 510. Cutting Pliers for removing Necrosed Bone. Fig. 511. Gouge-forceps. Fig. 513.—Necrosis-Forceps. Surgeon must be guided by the direction and the course of the fistulous tracks that lead to the principal apertures in. the new case, the incisions being placed in the axis of the limb, and carefully directed away from large blood-vessels and nerves. If the part has not been rendered bloodless, however, the haemor- rhage is somewhat abundant, in consequence of the injected state of the tissues furnishing a copious supply of blood, and their rigid condition preventing re- traction of the vessels ; this, however, may be arrested by a tourniquet, or by the pressure of an assistant’s fingers, and will soon gradually cease of itself. The bone having been freely exposed, it will sometimes be found that the cloacae are of sufficient size to allow the ready extraction of the sequestrum. But in the majority of cases, this cannot be done at once, and the apertures

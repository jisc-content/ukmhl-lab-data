EXCISION OF THE CLAVICLE. 375 f I perhaps of quite so formidable a character, have been performed by anen, l| .Travers, Curtis of Chicago, Cooper of San Francisco, and otlier Surgeons. It ^1-is obviously impossible to laydown definite rules for the performance of an ^ I operation in which the circumstances must vary so greatly in each case as in -Irithis, and for the safe conduct of which the Surgeon must be indebted mainly i: to his anatomical knowledge. It may be stated generally that the bone requires ,to be exposed by a free incision along its whole length : it is then sawn across or disarticulated at its acromial articulation, and carefully dissected out in a Fig. 537—Excision of elbow-joint. Sawing the liuuierus. ■f ir piirection from without inwards, the sternal end being forcibly twisted out, and tats ligamentous connections cautiously divided, care being taken to avoid the lamportant vessels and nerves in the lower part of the posterior triangle of the pueck, and to prevent, by ligature before division, the entry of air into any vein which it may be necessary to divide. The sternal end only of the clavicle has btieen excised by Davie of Bungay in a case in which dislocation backwards had I resulted from deformity of the spine, and the luxated end, gradually pressing |:upon the oesophagus, threatened the life of the patient. The bone was cut j through by means of a Key’s saw about an inch from its sternal end, and, j the sterno-clavicular ligaments having been divided, the portion of bone was j forcibly elevated, and at last e.xtracted.

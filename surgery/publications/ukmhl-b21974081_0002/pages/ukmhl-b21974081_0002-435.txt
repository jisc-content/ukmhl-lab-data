By this operation the sole of le foot is somewhat e.xtensively incised, and cicatrices are left over the eel. ■ In order to avoid this inconvenience, I have found that exarticulation of the i calcis may readily be performed in the following way. The patient lying on IS f^;c, a horseshoe-incision is canned from a little in front of the calcaiieo- iboid articulation round the heel, along the sides of the foot, to a correspond- g point on the opposite side. The elliptic flap thus fonncd is dissected up, D D ‘2 • sary to do this operation. Indeed, excision of the os calcis should not be lightly undertaken. The large size of the bone, its importance as a basis of ■ support to the body, and as the point of attachment of the strong muscles of ; the calf, should induce the Surgeon, whenever practicable, to avoid its com- : plete extirpation, and to limit himself to the application of the gouge, or - sharp spoon, even though he may have to scoop out the Avhole of the interior of the bone, leaving little more than an osseous shell. This will fill up with dense fibroid tissue, which will probably, eventually undergo partial ossifi- cation, and leave the foot as useful as ever for all purposes of support and • progression. Operation.—Excision of the os calcis is usually performed by turning a

I I f' 408 EXCISION OF JOINTS. Spillman says that of 73 cases 50 were successful. Among these, the outer raalleolns was removed in 22, onej of which required secondaiy amputation, and 4 died. This leaves 51 cases of removal of the tibio-tarsal joint; in 12 Fig. 562.—Excision of Astragalus. 1. Foot before Operation. 2. Foot Six months after the Removal of the Malleolar Arch, hoth Malleoli, the Astragalus, and a portion of the Upper Surface of the Calcaneum. i’' if uf these, the disease was of traumatic origin, and the operation was successftil in 11 ; in 37 it was constitutional, and of these 22 recovered, 7 died, 7 required secondary amputation, and in one the disease continued two years after the operation. 4. If the disease have extended from the astragalus to the scaphoid, and thence into the antai'ior range of tarsal joints, the foot will have become so exten- sively disorganized, that partial resection will be of little or no service ; and disarticulation at the ankle-joint should be practised. Excision of the Cuboid Bone, either in whole or in part, may 1)e required. Partial excision is here done with the gouge. When the whole of the bone is taken away, the fifth metatarsal bone also, with the little toe, will probably require removal. This may be done by making the flap, as depicted in Fig. 56, Yol. I., only commencing the incision about an inch further back, opposite the .calcaneo-cuboid articulation, and opening this instead of the metatarso-cuboid. The Scaphoid Bone is very commonly the seat of primary disease ; and, as this bone is connected in front with the large tarsal synovial membrane, and posteriorly with that which is common to the calcaneo-astragaloid and astragalo-scaphoid articulations, the greater part of the tarsus is apt to become speedily involved. It stands, indeed, next to the astragalus in its power of

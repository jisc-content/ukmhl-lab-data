The disastrous consequences of the procedure failed from some cause or other to sufficiently impress the mind (»f the profession at large ; and, until within the last ten years, tapping was looked upon as the proper preliminary treatment before recommending abdo- minal section. That such a course should have appeared justifiable in the early times of ovariotomy, when the diagnosis of ovarian disease was com- paratively in its infancy, is not unnatural ; but, at the present day, when the : study of abdominal tumours has been so greatly perfected, the fiict that ta])piug is an operation to be looked upon with the greatest distrust, is daily becoming more generally recognized ; and this belief has undoubtedly con- tributed to the success of ovariotomy. The second factor alluded to, viz., drainage of the abdominal cavity, prac- tised by the insertion at the lower extremity of the abdominal incision of a glass tube reaching to the bottom of Douglas’ pouch, has certainly taken a share in reducing the mortality after the operation. The value of this method, as a means of preventing the accumulation in the peritoneal cavity of fluids liable to undergo septic changes is undoubtedly great; but its employment nevertheless involves certain disadvantages which must not be lost sight of. Foremost among these arc the risk of entry of the causes of jmtrefaction along the track of the tube ; the possible irritation caused by its presence, involving the danger of intestinal obstruction fi’oni the formation of lymph around its extremity ; the tendency to subsequent weakening of the cicatrix at the seat of its insertion ; and, finally, the inconvenience to the ])atient caused by the frequent dressing's necessitated by its presence, which in .some degi'ec prevent that absolute quiet so beneficial to a rapid convalescence after (»variotomy. In view of these objections, it is fortunate that the anti- septic system, by the protection which it affords against sepsis, now enables the Surgeon to disixiiise with drainage in the great majority of instances where its ii.se would formerly have been justly deemed essential. 4’hc third, and perhaps the most important, factor in the increased success of ovariotomy, has been the general adojition of the intra])critoneal method in the treatment of the pedicle, as opjio.sed to the extraperitoncal method, by means of the clamp, which was formerly used to a very large extent. The disadvantages of tlie clamp are now .so self-evident, that it is difficult to nuderstand how it should so long have held its ground against the ligature. Certainly the practice of tying the pedicle with a silk thread, cutting the ends short off, and returning the stump, is the simplest and, if projierly managed, the .safest plan of treatment; and it is now universally adopted in dealing with ovarian tumours. The ii.se of tlic actual cautery, either alone or more commonly combined with that of the ligature, is still continued by .some few

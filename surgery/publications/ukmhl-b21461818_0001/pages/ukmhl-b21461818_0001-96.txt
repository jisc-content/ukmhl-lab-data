I 36 INJURIES OF THE HEAD ted blood. I apprehend both thefe pofitions to be falfe. That pure blood ihed from its veflels/by means of external violence, and kept from the air, will not turn to, or be- come matter, is (I think) proved incontef- tibly by every day's experience, in many in- ftances, in aneurifms by punfture, .in; re- tained menfes by imperforate vaginae, and in all ecchymofes. True pus cannot be made from blood merely, as may be known from the manner in which all abfceffes are formed, and from every circumftance attending fup- ' puration; and that the matter found on the furface of the dura mater, after great contu- fions of the head, never was mere blood, I am as certain, as obfervation and experience can make me. Some of the French writers have indeed divided the fymptoms of what they call a contufion of the head, into two kinds, and have named them primitive or original fymp- toms, and Jecondary or confequential ones : among the former, they rank immediate lofs of fenfe, haemorrhage, involuntary dif- charge of urine and faeces, great propen- fity to fleep, &c.; among the latter, they reckon fever, delirium, rig6r, cbnvulfion, &c.

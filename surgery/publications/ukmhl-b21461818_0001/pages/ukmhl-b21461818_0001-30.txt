( xvi ) , This cafe, which Mr. Pott fometimes re- ferred to, was a ftrong inftance of the great advantage of preventing the iniinuation of air into the wound of a compound fradlure; and it probably would not have ended fo happily, if the bone had not rnade itg ejcit, or external opening, at a diftance from the fracture; fo that, when it was returned into the proper place, a fort of valve was formed, which ex^ eluded air. Thus no bad fymptom enfued, but the wound healed, in fome meafure, by the firft intention.—The appearance of Mr. Pott as an author was an iiTimediate effect of this accident \ During the leifure of his ne- celfary confinement, he planned, and partly executed his treatife upon ruptures, which was completed by the latter end of the year. It w^s then not an early period of his life ; » I do not find that Mr. Pott had written any thing previous to this, except the relation of a curious cafe of tumors,, by >vhicli the bones were fpftened. This was prefented to the Royal Society foqn after he began bufinefs, and may be found in the 2d part of the 41ft volume of the PhUofophical Tranf- aftions. ^^^^

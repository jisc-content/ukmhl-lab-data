154 INJURIES OF THE HEAD was lb deficient, fo aukward, and fo un- handy, that they were thereby not only in general prevented from accomphfhing the good they intended, but were not infrequently driven into almoft unavoidable mifchief. ReduÂ£lion of the number of inftruments to be ufed in an operation, and sin extreme fimplicity and plainnefs in thofe which may be required, are a part of the merit of mo-^ dern furgery. The majority of the inftruments, with which our anceftors perforated the cranium, were contrived to make way for the admif- iion of other inftruments ; fuch as the fcalper exciforius, the cyciifcos, the fcalprum lenti- culatum, &c. with which they removed a portion of bone. Even the modioli, which were ufed by them, were fo fmall in the dia- meter of the faw, as to take away a very fmall piece at each application ; which cir- cumftance neceffarily leffened the benefit which might be expeded from the ufe of it, and rendered its repetition more frequently neceflary than it needed to have been, if it ,had been made larger.

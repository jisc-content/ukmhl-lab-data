FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE. 121 The bable method of attempting, his relief would be, by denuding and perhaps perforating the cranium, in the place where the prefllire pro- duced fo ftrange an effedl. The next day I removed a circular piece of the fcalp, and found the pericranium not Â©f a healthy or found colour, nor adherent to the bone ; which bone was carious, and had feveral fmall hofes in it, through which a fanies rofe an<l fell, according to the motion of the blood in the brain. I applied a large trephine, without any regard to the future, and removed a piece of fcull. During the time of the operation, the poor man fuffered greatly from fpafm ; but that over he became cafy and quiet. The dura mater was detached from the fcull, and had matter on its furface; which matter was extremely ofFenfive. The enfu- jng night he paffed ill; and the next day had fuch a rigor, that I verily thought it was the laft trouble the man could have. The day after this I found him vaflly better ; the dif- charge from his head had been large, but he had not fuffered any return either of fpafm or rigor, and his principal complaint was extreme lownefs.

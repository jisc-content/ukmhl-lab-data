FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE. 165 The number of perforations which it may be neceflary to make, can only be determined by the nature of each individual cafe. If the operation be performed on account of fuch fymptoms as feem to indicate a bloody â€¢ extravafation, and (b free a difcharge is pro- duced by one opening, as alleviates or removes the fymptoms, that one may be all that may be neceflary; but if the firft perforation only difcovers the difeale, and is not followed by fuch difcharge as relieves, or removes the fymptoms, the operation ought to be repeated again and again. If there be no fymptoms of extravafation, and the inftrument has been applied in a preventative fenfe merely, the length of the fradure muft determine the number; one or two only may be made at firH:, and it may be right to wait for farther diredlion from future in order to remove a confidcrable cuantity of bone ; and among the writers on this fubjea, are frequent relations of fuch fafts. The praftice is undoubtedly juft and right j but I cannot help thinking, from what I have feen of the perforating inftrumenta . of many of our predecefibrs, that a part of their trouble, and pf the fatigue of their patients in fuch cafes, might have been much leflened, had the circle of their faw been larger. The advantage of a large circle is great; the inconvenience imagi- .nary. M 3 clrcumftances.

Does .not the putting the mufcles in a ftate of tenfion, or into a ftate approaching nearly to that of tenfion, almoft neceflarily produce this effed ? or, in other words, does not that pofition of a limb, which puts its mufcles into, or nearly into fuch ' a ftate, give fuch mufcles an opportunity of exerting their greateft power either of adion or of refinance ?

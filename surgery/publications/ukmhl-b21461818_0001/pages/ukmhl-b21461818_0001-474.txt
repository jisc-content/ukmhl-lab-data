And is not the reafon, why this muft be the mofl eafy pof- ture, obvious ? From want of attention to, or from not iinderftanding thefe few felf-evident prin- ciples, many people permit their patients to fufFer confiderable inconvenience, both prefent and future. It is a maxim univerfally taught and re- ceived, that a fradured limb may be in fuch ftate, as not to admit of the extenfion necef- fary for its being fet; that is, if affiftance be not at hand, when the accident happens ; if they who bring the patient home, do it fo aukwardly or rudely as to bruife and hurt the part; if from drunkennefs, folly, or obftinacy in the patient, it happens that the Hmb is fo difordered that it is found to be much fwollen, inflamed, and painful, it is allowed not to be in a ftate to admit extenfion. This, I fay, is a general maxim, and founded upon very juft principles; but what is the general pra6lice in confequence of it ? It is, to place the limb in an extended, ftraight pofition.

6 INJURIES OF THE HEAD fome it is a practice, immediately to remove fuch portion of the fcalp as is fairly and per- fectly detached from the parts underneath ; with others, to attempt its prefervation. Each of thefe opinions can be confidered in a general fenfe only, not as applicable to every individual cafe without diftindion; and taken in fuch general confideration, they cannot be both right. It may therefore be worth while to inquire, what reafons each party has to give for its opinion and condu6t. .They whoadvife the removal, affirm, that when a large portion of the fcalp has been perfeaiy and totally feparated from the parts it ought to cover, and that for fome confider- able fpace, it will not again coalefce or unite with fuch parts; and therefore that an at- tempt to procure fuch union, by replacing the feparated piece, will only protrad the time of cure, by furnifliing a lodgment for matter and Houghs, which matter and floughs muft prevent the thing intended. That in cafe of large wounds,, or of thofe produced by great force, as we cannot by any means be abfolutely certain that no mifchief is done to the parts under the cranium, the replacing the lacerated fcalp may not only prevent our immediate inquiry into the nature of fuch mifchief,

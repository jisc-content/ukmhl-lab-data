333 OBSERVATIONS ON THE of the OS unguis was either accidental, or made merely for the difcharge of matter \ - Fabritius ab Aquapendente, who in general copies Paulus, fpeaks of the perforation as meant only to make a depending orifice for matter, " Poll carunculae & loci excifionem, terebra humorem aut pus in nares derivarint." Fab. ab Aqjjapendente. Gul. de Saliceto, and indeed many other of the ancient writers, fpeak of ufing both cautery and terebra to the purpofe of deriving the matter and fanies which lodge in the fac, into the nofe; and, by making a depending orifice, to procure a firni bafis to heal on. " Afpice os, & fi fuerit corruptum cau- «' teriza ipfum ufque ad ejus profundum, & concavitatem cum «' cauterio punftuali, & perfora ipfum ad aliam partem, ejus ^' ut fanies per nafum fluat, deinde incarnetur et confolidetur." Gul. de Saliceto. \ Indeed the formation of an artificial palTage for the lachry- mal fluid could make no part of the intention of thofe who were not riglitly acquainted with the natural one. Paulus mentions perforation with the terebra as the praAice of fome in his time, but from what he fays, it is plain he did not praftice it himfelf, or think it neceflary, and that he re- garded it only as a method of making a depending orifice ; his words are, " Quod fi jam carie vexatum eft, ferro candenti, acuto, ac in cufpidem abeunte ^durimus fpongia frigida ma- ^' dente oculo impofita. ** Sunt qui poft carunculas excifionem terebra ufi humorem aut pus in nares derivarint; nos autem fatis habuimus eouf- " que folum ferramentis ad iEgylopem accommodatis adurere f ut fquama abfcederet.''

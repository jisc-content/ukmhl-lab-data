2o8 INJURIES OF THE HEAD In cafes where the broken pieces of a de- preffed fradure are widely feparated from each other, and fome of them a good deal loofened, the expediency'and the propriety of removing fuch pieces is acknowledged by every body ; but few people attend to the reafon, or in- quire why fuch praftice is juft and proper; if they did, they would alfo fee that the free removal of bone was equally proper in the cafe of great violence, as in that of loofened or widely feparated pieces. In the latter, the broken parts' are removed, becaufe their re- union with the reft of the cranium, and the prefefvation of the attachment of the dura mater to the inner furface of them, is thought impoflibfe, or at leaft highly improbable; and that therefore they muft be in the way, and hinder the free difcharge of matter from the fuppurating membrane.

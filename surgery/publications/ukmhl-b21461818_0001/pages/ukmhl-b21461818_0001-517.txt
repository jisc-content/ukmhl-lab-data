The lower extremity of this bone, which defcends conliderably below that end of the tibia, is by ftrong and inelaftic liga- ments firmly conne<5ted with the laft-named bone, and with the aftragalus, or that bone of the tarfus which is principally concerned in forming the joint of the ancle. This lower extremity of the fibula has, in its pofte- rior part, a fuperficiai fulcus for the lodgment and paflage of the tendons of the peronei mufcles, which are here tied down by flrono" ligamentous capful;£, and have their a6lion fo determined from this point or angle, that the fmalleft degree of variation from it, in confcquence of external force, mufl necef- farily have confiderable effe<£l on the motions they are defigned to execute, and confe- quently diftort the foot. Let it alfo be con- fidered, that upon the due and natural ftate of the joint of the ancle, that is, upon the exad and proper difpofition of the tibia and fibula, both with regard to each other and to the aftragalus, depend the juft difpofition and proper adion of feveral other mufcles of the foot and toea j fuch as the gaftrocnemii, the D d 4 . tibialis.

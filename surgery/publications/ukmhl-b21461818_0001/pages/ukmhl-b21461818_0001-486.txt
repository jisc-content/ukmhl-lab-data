37^ REMARKS ON FRACTURES The old writers are in general very precife as to the numbef of days during which the roller fhould be fuffered to remain without being fhifted; and the number of times which fuch fhifting fhould be repeated within the firft fortnight ^ This exaditude is by no means neceffary; but if the bandage be fuppofed to be of any ufe at all, it is obvious, that it ought to be renewed or adjufted as often as it may ceafe to perform the office for which it is defigned, or whenever it fliall be found to counterad fuch office; that is, as often as it fhall become fo flack as not to con- tain the fradure at all; or whenever the.limb fhall be fo fwollen, that the roller makes an improper degree of ftridure; the former generally occurs every four or five days; the latter is moft frequent within the firft week. In moil: of the writers on the fubjeÂ£t of fradures, we alfo find marks or figns laid ^ " Tertio die a deligatione fadla, Hippocrates fafcias re- " folvit, &c. Fafta bona deligatura & pruritu non infedlante, *' a tertio ufque ad feptimum oportet aegrum deligatum deti- *' nere. *' Septlmo mcmbrum rurfus folvendiim, perfundendum aqua " tepida, & ligandum."

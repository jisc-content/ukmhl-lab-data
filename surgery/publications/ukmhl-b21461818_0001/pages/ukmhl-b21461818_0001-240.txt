I fhould be forry to be fo mifunderftood, as to have it fuppofed that I mean to fay,- that I think the denudation of the dilra mater a matter of abfolute indifference, or that no ill can proceed from it; this, I know, is a point concerning which the beft practitioners have differed, and concerning which, we ftill fland in need of information; but I think I may venture to fay, what is fully to my pre-^- lent purpofe, viz. that enlarging.t'he opening .of a fradture, by means of a trephine, will not produce or occafion much rifque or hazard^ additional to what mufl be occafioned by the fracture itfelf: that has already let in the air iipon the membrane, and therefore that con^^ fideration is, at leaft in fome degree, at an end-; and the principal point to be determined ftill remains the fame, viz. whether upon a fuppofition, that the dura mater may polfibly not have been fo injured as to inflame and fuppurate in future^ the operation ought not to be pradifed as a preventative, but on the contrary, ought rather to be deferred until worfe fymptoms indicate the necefhty of it ? or

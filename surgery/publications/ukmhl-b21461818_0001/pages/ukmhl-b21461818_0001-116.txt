56 INJURIES OF THE HEAD made clean and replaced for the purpofe of fuch experiment, which, if it lucceeds, will fave much time, and prevent confiderable de- formity. If this attempt does not fucceed, the detached piece may be removed, and the cafe then becomes as if the fcalp and the pe- ricranium had been forced away at the time that, the. wound was firft inflidted; and the worft that can happen, is an exfoliation from the bare fcuU Â°. It does alfo fometimes happen, that the force which detaches or removes the fcalp, o Not that exfoliation is tlie necelTary confequence pf the fcuU being laid bare : this depends upon other circumftances, befides the mere removal of the fcalp ar.d pericranium. The folidity of the furface of the bones, the iize of the veffels, and the impulfe of the blood through them, are what princi- pally determine that. If the cortex of the bone be not very hard, and the impulfe of the blood be capable of counter- balancing the efFeds of the external air, a granulation of flelh will be generated on the furface of the bone, which will covet and firmly adhere to it, without throwing off the fmalleft ex- foliation ; efpecially in young fubjefts. On the contrary, if the bone be much hardened, and tlie reffels thereby con- ftringed; or if fuch applications be made ufe of, as will pro- duce an artificial conftriftion of them, the furface will necella- rily become dry, and the juices ceafing to circulate through it, it muft part with a fcale to a certain depth; that is, that part of the furface through which the circulation ceafes to b? carried on will be feparated from, and call off by the veffcl? which nourifli the reft of the bon?. does

to INJURIES OF THE HEAD The manner in which it is to be there maintained, muft a good deal depend upon the particular circumftances of each individual in the ftirrup, received a kick on the forehead. As he was at a great diftance from London, I did not fee him till forty hours after the accident: he had been, and flill continued, in a Hate of infenfibility : the horfe's Ihoe had ftruck him on the edge of the orbit, and had torn the eye-brow and nearly one half of the covering of the forehead, which was raifedÂ» and formed a flap. The wound, which was very large, had been filled, foon after the accident, with lint: it immediately occurred to me, that, if it were fufFered to heal in this fituation, tlie confe- quent deformity muft be deplorable. I therefore removed the drefiings, and found the os frontis denuded in two places : but, as there appeared to be no frafture, except of a fmall portion of bone, which had been broken off from the edge of ihe orbit, and as his fymptoms were rather thofe of general concuflion, I conceived it would be right to endeavour to pro- cure an union of the feparated parts. The length of time fmce they had been divided, and the drefiings, had left the fibres fo dry and conftringed, that they appeared very ill dif- pofed to unite. However, after having got rid of the remainder of the lint, and made it perfeftly clean with warm water, I fcarified the whole internal furface of the detached fcalp, and the parts of the mufcle which ftiU adhered to the bone, which his abfence of perception enabled me to perform freely. I then brought them into cbntaft, and retained them in that fituation by the dry future. I had the. fatisfadion to find them unite by the firft intention, making a fimple line nearly down the middle of the forehead. By proper treatment he foon re- gained his fenfes; and a fmall exfoliation from the edge of the orbit, at the bottom of the wound, was the only circumftance which for fome time retarded the perfed cure.

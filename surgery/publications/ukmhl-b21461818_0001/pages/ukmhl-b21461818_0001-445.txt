It does indeed burn the bone and mem- brane, through which it pierces, and thereby prevents the orifice from clofing again imme- diately; and this is certainly the principal end of perforation, by whatever inftrument it IS performed, but it is alfo as certain, that the fame end is obtainable by means lefs mif- chievous and lefs horrrible.

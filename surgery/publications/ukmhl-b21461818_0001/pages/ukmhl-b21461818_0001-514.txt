I 404 REMARKS ON FRACTl/RES (what is fufficient for my purpofe) that k will not only fucceed in all thofe, in which the old method can ever be fuccefsful; but alfo in the majority of thofe in which it is not, nor in the nature of things can. In thofe fortunate cafes, in which either method will do, the old one is fatiguing, inconvenient, and even fometimes offeniive, from the fupine and confined pofture of the patient; whereas that which is here propofed, gives the patient much greater liberty of motion for every pur- pofe either of choice or neceffity; and in many of thofe cafes, wherein the old method proves mofh frequently fo far fuccefslefs, as to leave the limb fhort, lame, or deformed, I fay, in moft of thefe, the propofed method will not be attended with thefe inconve- niences I have P If it were neceffary to add any thing to tht advantages which Mr. Pott has mentioned, arifing from the relaxed poli- tion in fraftures. It might be obferved, that in this fituation patients very rarely fufFer from cramps and fpafms, which are frequently attendant when the limb is laid ftraight, and are both painful and produftlve of mifchief; and I might remark, that people whofe limbs have been fradured by a fall, a kick of a hprfe, or any other accident, are very fubjeft to have their minds fo agitated, that their flecp for many nights is unfound, they continually dri^am of falling, or meeting with fome mifchance. 1

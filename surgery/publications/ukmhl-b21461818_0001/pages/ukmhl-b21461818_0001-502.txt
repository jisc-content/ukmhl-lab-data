But as it is my intention by thefe fheets to inculcate another, and as it appears to me a better difpofition of the limb, in which fuch boxes, cradles, and pieces of machinery are not wanted, nor can be ufed, it is needlefs for me to fay any thing about them. According to this plan, the fradur^ leg and thigh fliould be depofited on the pillow, â– . in the very pofture in which the extenfion was made, and the fradure fet, that is with the knee bent. I have already been fo explicit, or perhaps prolix, on the tenfe and lax flate of the muf-. cles, as depending on pofture, under the head of extenfion, that I {hall fpare the reader, as well as myfelf, a good deal of trouble by re- ferring back to that article. All that is there urged, or that can be urged for making the extenfion, that is, for fetting a fradlure in fuch difpofition of a limb or its mufcles, is equally powerful and conclufive with regard to.

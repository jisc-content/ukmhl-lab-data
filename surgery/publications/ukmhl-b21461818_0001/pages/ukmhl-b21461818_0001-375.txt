On the fourth, there being no alteration, I deter- mined to apply a trephine on that part of her head, on which fhe was faid to have fallen, and which when prefl'ed hard feemed to pro- duce fuch motion in, her .as if it gave fome pain. In a cafe of lefs neceffity this would hardly have been an authority, but here fomething was to be attempted. I removed a large piece of fcalp, and found the pericranium, though not detached abfolutely, yef not naturally or firmly adherent. I applied the trephine, and when I had worked a few feconds, I took out the inftrument to clean it, but was much furprifed, to find in it a piece of the upper table of the fcuU. I put in my finger to feel what was underneath, and found that it touched the remaining table, which receded from the finger, and returned again upon re- moving it; and when I preffed the faid loofe piece hard, the girl's whole frame was fpaf- piodically agitated. What was to be done ? It appeared to me, that if all her fymptoms were not caufed by the preiTure of the loofe piece, yet they were certainly aggravated by it, that it mufl therefore be taken away at all events.

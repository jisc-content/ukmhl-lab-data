FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE. 135 of preventing this evil feems to be, the re- moval of fuch a part of the fcull, as by being broken appears plainly to have been the part where the violence was inflidted; and which, if the dura rnater becomes inflamed, and quit- ting its connexion fuppurates, will, in' all probability, cover and confine a colledlion of qiatter, for which nature has provided no outlet. This 1 take to be, not only the beft, but the only good reafon, for the early ufe of the trephine in fimple undepreffed fractures of the fcull: and I muft add, that it appears to me- to be fully fufficient to vindicate and authorife it. That it frequently fails of fuc- cefs, is beyond all doubt ; the extent and de- gree of the mifchief being too great for it to relieve ; but that it has preferved many a life, which muft have been loft without it, lam as well fatisfied of, as I ain^of any truth which repeated experience may have taught me.

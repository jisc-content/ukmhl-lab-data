AND DISLOCATIONS, 405 I have already faid, that \n moft cafes of broken thigh or leg, the method juft de^ fori bed mlfchance, and they catch and Tpring with an imaginary at- tempt to fave themfelves. When the leg was laid in a Hue with the body, the jerk was infallibly communicated to the fradlure, which gave the patient excruciating pain, and ruined Jiis repofe for the remainder of the night; and in the morning the tedious, procefs of putting it to rights was ne^eflarily re- newed. The involuntary adtions of coughing and fneezing had alfo the fame difagreeable cfFeft. Whoever has been ac- cuftomed to fee fraftured legs lying in the ftraight pofture,'muft be fenfible that thefe circumftances continually occur : iri the relaxed pofition the ftiock is loft in the bended joints of the hip and knee, and the limb is not obliged to move wit;h the body. As Mr. Pott'has given in this treatife fome direftions for placing pillows under ftaftured limbs, it may not be improper JO take notice, that of late years lie was not partial to the ufe of themj I have pften heard him objeft to their being placed between the fplint and the limb. Indeed, in general our in- tentions are better effedled without any. I would take the liberty to recommend, in fraftures of the leg or thigh, fo foon as the bones are fet, and the limb placed in a proper pofition on . a fplint, that it be gently laid oij the bed, pre- yioufly made firm, fmooth, and level. In this manner it lies pn a foundation to be depended on : if a pillow, be placed under fradlured leg, it elevates it above the level of the body, and the thigh remains unfupported ; if another be placed under the ihigh, though it may in fome meafure obviate this inconve- nience, it is very liable to be difplaced. In general, the ele- .yation of the leg, fo far from being necefiary, is prejudicial ; the limb will lie with much more eafe and fccurity when on a ^cvel with the pelvis; the bed therefore cannot be made too .

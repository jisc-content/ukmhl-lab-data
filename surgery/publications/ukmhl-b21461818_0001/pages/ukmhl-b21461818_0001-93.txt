FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE. 33 The efFedl of this kind of violence is fre- quently confined to the veffels conne6ling the dura mater to the cranium, in which cafe the matter is external to the faid membrane; but it fometimes happens, that, by the force either of the ftroke or of the concuffion, the veffels which pafs between and connect the two meninges are injured in the fame man- ner; in which cafe, the matter formed in confequence of fuch violence is found on the furface of the brain, or between the pia and dura mater, as well as on the furface of the latter ; or perhaps in all thefe three fit nations at the fame time. The difference of this kind of difeafe, from either an extravalation of blood, or a commotion of the medullary parts of the brain, is great and obvious. All the com- plaints pr-oduced by extravafation, are, (as I have already faid) fuch as proceed from preffiire, made on the brain and nerves, and obfi:ruÂ£tion to the circulation of the blood through the former ; ftupidity, lofs of fenfe, taches, par la meme raifon, plufieurs des filets^ qui attachent la dure mere au crane ont du fe rompre auffi: d'ou s'en fuivi un eryfipele, qu'occafion fuppuration, ou plutot pourriture.

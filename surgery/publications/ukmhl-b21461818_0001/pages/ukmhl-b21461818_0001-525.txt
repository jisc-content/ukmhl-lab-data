AND DISLOCATIONS. j^t^ and thofe which pafs behind the fibula and under the os calcis, are all put into a ftate of relaxation and non-refiftance, all this diffi- culty and trouble do in general vanifh imme- diately ; the foot may ealily be placed right, the joint reduced, and by maintaining the fame difpolition of the limb, every thing will in general fucceed very happily, as I have many times experienced. Two kinds of fradlure there are, and only two that I can recoiled (relative to the limbs) which do not admit of the bent por- tion of the joints, I mean that of the procef- fus olecranon at the elbow, and that of the patella; in thefe a ftraight pofition of the arm and leg is necelTary; in the former to keep the fraflured parts in contact till they are united, in the latter, to bring them as near to each other as may befl ferve the pur- pofe of walking afterward With ^ Although a ftraight pofition of the limb Is necCiTar^ jfor the 'broken patella, yet this ver^ pofition becomes fo upon the fame principle, as renders the bent pofture moll advantageous in the broken tibia and femur, viz. the relaxation of the muYcles and tendons attached to the fradlured bone. Whoever will for a moment attend to the difpofition of the pieces in a patella, which has been broken tranfverfely, will fee how little neceffary or ttfeful the many contrivances of bandages.

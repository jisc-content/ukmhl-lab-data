4^4' 'Remarks on fractures With regard to the fraaure of the patella^ an opinion has long and generally prevailed^ which feems to mfe to have no foundation in truth, or (when duly confidered) even in probability; it isj that the great degree of ftifFnefs in the joint of thfe knee, which is fometimes found to be the confeqUence of this kind of fraaure^ is owing to^ or pro- duced by, a quantity of callus falling into it from the edges of the broken bone ; and that the nearer the broken pieces are brought to each other, the more likely fuch eonfe- quence is. Every part of this doarine feerns equally abfurd. In the fii-ft place, the fradured bone is by no means capable of fupplying fuch i bandages, firaps, contpreffes, buckles, buttons, &c. to be - found in writers are, efpecially all that part of them which are applied to the inferior fragment. By the adliort of the united tendons of the extehfores inufclei of the leg, the fupcrior fragment is pulled upward and fepa- rated from the inferior, bvit the latter i-emains nearlyi if not abfolutely, where it was before the accident; there is hothing to aft upon it, and therefore it cannot, nor does it hiove. The extenfion of the leg puts the aiifcles attached to the Upper part of the broken bone into a ftate of relaxation, and prevents their afting; and though a fmall comprefs juft above this piece, with a moderate bandage, may be ufeful toward retaining it, yet it is the polition of the leg v/hich mnfi keepi the broken piece downj and efFeft the cure. quantity

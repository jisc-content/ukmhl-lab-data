0I3SERVATI0NS ON THE v/cmld haften the fuppuration of the fuppofed abfcefs ^ By ^ Mr. Serjeant Wifeman moft certainly did not underlknd this difeafe, and miftook it either for a tumor of the encyfted kind, or for an inflammatory defluxion, and treated it as fuch: his words are, " JEgylops is a tumor of the inner canthus of the eye, either " fcrophulous, setheromatous, or of the nature of a meliceris, " or fometimes with inflammation : the caufes of ^gylops are the fame that produce the like tumor in other places, but " fometimes it is made by fluxion, and appeareth firft as a " plegmon : if it be ftruma or etheronia, it is made by conv gellion." " The indications of cure are taken from the ^gylops, whe- " ther it be in its beginning with inflammation, or by con- " geftion, pafling its matter forth under the cilium into the " eye, in which cafe it is fiflulated, Anchylops has alfo its " peculiar way of treating as other tumors of the glands." Without any defign to criticife on the flrange unintelligibi- lity of the Serjeant's language, I believe I may venture to fav, that no man who is not previoufly acquainted with the nature of the difeafe, will learn from hence that its feat is in the lachry- mal fac, and that an obfl:rudlion in the nafal dudl is the firfi: caufe of it. To come ftill nearer, or even into our own time; Dr. Daniel Turner compiled a treatife of furgery, which was univerfally difperfed, and read all over the kingdom, and was at that time generally looked upon as a true reprefentation of the London praftice : the Doftor fays, " Anchylops or yEgylops are dif- " eafes of the internal canthus of the eye, in which the la- " chrymal gland is concerned, and from whence the fifl:ula of the fame part is denominated : the prognoflic may be ga- ** thered

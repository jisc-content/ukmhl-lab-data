FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE, 107 did not feem to have any other complaint, 3cvas nearly three weeks in healing. On the eighth of March, he was feized with a fever, beginning with a kind of cold Â£t. On the tenth he was much difordered, complained of acute pain in his head; and his wound, which had been healed, broke put again, the pericranium feparating from the bone ; on the twelfth, he became fenfe- Jefs to all outward objedls, was convulfed in all his limbs, and jaw locked. On this day ^r. Crane trepanned him on the upper, fore and right fide of the frontal bone. On the furface of the dura mater was found a confi- derable quantity of good matter: on the next morning he died.. The dura mater was detached from the cranium for about an inph, all round the per- foration of the bone; what matter had been formed on its furface had been difcharged by the operation, and little or none lodged; the pia mater and brain found in this part. At about two inches diftance from the original wound, higher up, and nearer both to the coronal and fagittal futures, was a fmall mmor about the fize of a fplit garden bean ; mthm this was a very little difcoloured mat- ter.

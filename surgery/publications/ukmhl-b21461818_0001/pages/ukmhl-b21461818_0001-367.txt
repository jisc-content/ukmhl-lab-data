During three days he was let blood twice a day ; on the fourth, a fmall degree of tumefadion ap- peared on the right fide of his head near to the fagitt^ future; it was not very manifeft, neither did it appear to contain any confider- able quantity of fluid, but the very defperate circumftances the child was in, induced me to open it, and, finding the fcull bare, to per- forate. The dura mater was covered with blo(5d, which difcharged freely both at the time of the operation, and during all the next day. On the third day from, the operation, he was ftill infenlible. A fecond perforation was made juft below the firft, and a third on the other fide of the future. Blood was dif- charged freely from all three. He was drefT- ed lightly, and his pulfe being flill flrong, more blood was drawn from one of the jugu- lars. The next day he was rather better, but far from fenfible. The day following that, he recovered his underftanding, and could make figns for what he wanted. It was near a week more before he got his fpeech, but in the end he got perfe£lly well. S 2 CASE ■A

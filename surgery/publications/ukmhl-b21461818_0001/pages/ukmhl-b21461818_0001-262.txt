lÂ§6 INJURIES OF THE HEAD I have already faid, that what are called the principal and diagiioflic figns of a frac- tured fcull are by no means to be depended on, as indicating fuch mifchief to exift ; it can therefore be hardly neceflary to obferve, that what are called the uncertain figns re- quire our regard flill lefs. Thefe have been mentioned by many writers, who have co- pied each other; fuch are, the holding a filk or horfe-hair tight between the grinding teeth and the hand, and the making it vibrate by flriking on it; the biting an hard body, and attending to the pain produced by fuch ac^ tion ; with fcveral other of like fort; which, not tp mention that they imply the pj^tient tq be fenfible and intelligent, are fp truly equi- vocal 2L$ to deferve no notice Ihould be made of light wood, not too long, and of jfn oftangu- Jar figure. Whoever will try tlie fame inftruments, thus dif- ferently made, will, I think, be immediately fenfible of the preference due to the lighter handle. It is almoft impoffible for the handle of an inftrument, whofe point or extremity is to be worked with, to be too light. It is no uncommon thing tq fee couching needles, and inltruments of like kind, laden with heavy bone handles, the inconvenience of which is tpo obvious; to mention.

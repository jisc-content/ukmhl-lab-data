FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE. 155 Inftead therefore of that ftrange variety and multipUcity of inftruments, which I have akeady mentioned to have been ufed by them, we now require only a trephine of fuch a fize as to remove a fufficient quantity of bone at once, and an elevator ; or perhaps, now and then, a pair of forceps. Tliefe are all we ever can want; and thefe may be fo made, as to be manageable by the hand of any man of common judgment, with great eafe to himfelf, with very little fatigue and no hazard to the patient. With thefe we can , make as large or as fmall an opening in the fcull as we pleafe ; either for the relief of the dura mater, for the difcharge o,f blood or mat- ter, or for the elevation of depreffed or ex- traction of ioofe pieces of bone, and that without difturbing the patient greatly, or in- curring any riik of wounding the brain or its membranes"". I have It has been cuftomary to make the handle of the trephine cf iron, and to form the extremity of fuch handle in fuch man- ner, as to make it ferve the purpofe of an elevator; thus com- bining, as it were, two inftruments in one. This, I think, is a great fault; fuch iron handle adds confidferably to the weight of the inftrument, and that in a wrong part of it; and thereby fenders it lefs manageable. The handle of this inftrument ftiould

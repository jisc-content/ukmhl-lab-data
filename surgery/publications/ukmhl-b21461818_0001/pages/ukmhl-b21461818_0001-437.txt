The upper and hinder part of the facculus Jachrymahs is firmly attached to the os un^ guis, a fmall and very thin bone juft within the orbit of the eye j which bone is fo fituat- ed that if it be by any means broken through, i)r removed, the two cavities of the nofe and of the orbit, communicate with each other, confequently the os unguis forms the parti- tion between the hinder part of the lachry^ mal bag, aud the upper part of the cavity of the nofe ; and it is by making a breach in this partition that we attempt the forma, tion of an artificial paffage for the lachry^ mal fluid. This operation, if confidered merely as a perforation, is no invention of the moderns: the antients undoubtedly performed it; but though it was executed much in the fame manner as it is now, yet it was not done with the fame intention.

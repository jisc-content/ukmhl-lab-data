And dislocations. - 41^ i cannot take leave of this fubjciSl of fimplc fraitiires, without mentioning a circumftance relative to them, which although, when rightly underflood, is of little or no import- too ftrift and too long confinement; and his cOnflant praflice was, to lay the leg in a perfedlJy ilraight pofture, to elevate the heel, and, by a moderate bandage and comprefsi to bring down the fuperior portion of the patella. In this pofition he ufuaUy kept it near three weeks, after which time he allowed of a fmall degree of motion, which he recommended to be gra- dually increafed. In fraftures of this bone, it is not always in GUI' power to bring the divided parts into contadt, confequently there will be a Ipace, which will be fupplied with ligament- ous fubrtahce, as the olTeous fibres are here fparingly pro- duced. Ih proportion to the diftance between the two parts of the bone, the chord or tendon on which the extenfor mufcles . aft, muft be longer than when the bone is in its perfeft ftate, and the mufcular power muft be proportionally leflened. This fhould certainly be avoided as much as poffible, and can only be avoided by bringing the parts as nearly as may be into con- taft. Unlefs this union be in fome degree preferved, the muf- cles will have too little power on the ligament which is inferred m the tibia, although they contraft to the greateft poffible de- gree; confequently the perfon whofe patella is much elon- gated, is obliged to depend principally on the flexor mufcles of the thigh, and the weight of the leg itfelf, to bring it forward â€¢vin progrefllon; which is performed in a moft aukward manner, and IS found particularly inconvenient in going up and down flairs. If both patellas have been broken, and are in the fame lengthened flate, the perfon is generally obliged to afcend and defcend fideways, Vol. I, E e aace.

l^ROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE. 225 ftiade on the brain and nerves, are, as I have ah-eady at large remarked, frequently miftaken as indications of a difeafe which, confidered abftra(5ledly, can never caufe them ; I mean a hmple undepreffed fradure of the craniurp : it may be accompanied by them, but cannot caufe them. When a fluid is extravafated in any confi- derable quantity within the cavity of the cra- nium, if any bad fymptoms are produced by it at all, they are, and muft be, fuch as indi- cate prefllire made on the brain and origin of the nerves; occafioning thereby either dif- turbance or abolition of the offices of fenfe and motion ; and this in different degree, ac- cording to the quantity, kind, and fituatioa of the preffing fluid ; and to thefe are fome- times added haemorrhage from the nofe or ears. Thus far, I think, we may pronounce pofitively; but to our very frequent mortifi- cation we find, thefe are the only circum- ftances which in fuch cafe we can depend upon, every thing elfe which relates or be- longs to them being involved in a moil: per- plexing obfcurity. We not only have no cer- tain infallible rule whereby to diflinguifli what ' the preffing fluid is, or where it iยง fituated. Vol. I. r

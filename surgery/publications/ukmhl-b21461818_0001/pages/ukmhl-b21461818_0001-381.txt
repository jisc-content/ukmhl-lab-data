THE PREFACE. B y frequently converfing with fome of that part of the profeflion who come to London to attend the hofpitals, and to improve themfelves in the art of furgery, it has appeared to me that the Fistula Lachrymalis, though a very common difeafe, is one with which many of them are very little acquainted, either with regard to its oaufe, feat, or method of cure. Some are totally ignorant of every thing relating to it: others who have an imperfeil idea of its na- ture and feat, are yet much at a lofs how to vary the me- thod of treating it according to its different ftates and cir- cumftances; upon which diftinÂ£lion the probability of a cure does often in great meafure depend j for if thofe means which are only proper in one flate of the difeafe be ufed in another, the patient will be fetigued to no purpofe, and the furgeon by being frequently difappointed will be inclined to thinlc thofe cafes incurable, which have only failed through his own mifmanagement. ^ Vol. I.

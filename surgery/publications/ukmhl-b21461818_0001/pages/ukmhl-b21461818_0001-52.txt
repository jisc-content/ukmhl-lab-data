( xxxviii ) In Memory Of PERCIVALL POTT, Efq. F. R. S. Surgeon of St, Bartholomew's Hofpltal during Forty-two Years, Who depaited this Life, December zad, 1788, aged 75. He was .Singularly eminent in his Profeflion, To which he added many new Refources, and which he Uluftrated With matchlefs Writings. Let Pofterity revolve the Sum of his Expe.ience,^ That the World may ftlU enjoy the Benefit of his Succefsful Praftice. He honoured the colleftive Wifdom of patt Ages: The Labours of the Ancients were familiar to him: He fcorned to teach a ^cience of which he had not traced the growth j He rofe, therefore, from the Form to the Chair. Learn, Reader, that the painful Scholar can alone become The Faithful Teacher, But his Studies had a double Iffue: Whilft he gathered the Knowledge of his Predeceflbrs, He perceived their Errors,' and correfted them; He difcovered their Defers, and fupplied them, original in Genius, prompt in Judgment, rapid in Decif.on, He direfted Knowledge to its properTnds; But purfued them when the Aids of Information were exhaufted, , The laft Steps, therefore, and great Improvements, Were lus own. His Integrity is before his Judge; Without it, his Skill might have profited Manlund . ;p,t could have claimed no Record within tl.cfe Walls. His private Virtues, His fignal Tendernefs to his -Family, Completed an Example, Amiable, Ufeful, Great.

If to thefe confider- ations we add another, no lefs true, and im- portant, (viz.) that there is and muft be a conftant communication, by means of blood- veffels, between all the parts without and within the head, it, will appear, that injuries done to this part, though feemingly, and at ^firft fight, flight and trivial, may fometmies prove of the greateft confequence.

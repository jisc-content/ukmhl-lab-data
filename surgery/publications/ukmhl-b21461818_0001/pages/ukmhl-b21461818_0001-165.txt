On the right fide, the dura mater was in a natural, found, adherent ftate. On the left, it was feparated from almofl the whole bone, and covered plentifully by mat- ter, and was, for about the breadth of an half crown, floughy ; under the Hough the pia mater was difeafed alfo, and matter was alfo formed on the furfacc of the brain. Th6 following cafe was brought into St. Bartholomew's hofpital, while I was con- fined to my houfe by ficknefs. The account therefore of the patient, while living, is as taken by Mr. Earle, my apprentice; and that of the appearance after death, is in the words of the late ingenious Mr. Partridge, who affiled Mr. Earle in the examination of the body.

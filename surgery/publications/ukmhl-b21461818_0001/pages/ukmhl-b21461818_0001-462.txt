354 REMARKS <5n fractures I mnft defire that what I have faid may nof be mifconftriied. I do not mean that there are not, and have not at all times been men of particular ingenuity, who have deviated from the common methods, and have greatly improved the art; but ftill the common me- thods are the fame^ and the multitude of practitioners religioufly follow them. Let me not therefore be charged with prefump- tion or arrogance, if I fay, that under almoft every of ,the foregoing heads the pradlice is capable of conliderable improvements ; im- provements which would fliow rationality and fenfe in the furgeon, and produce eafe and convenience to the patient.

' " Qiise " Imberbes didicere, fenes perdenda fateri," is a hard leffon fometimes to human vanity, and what requires fome degree of candour to learn.

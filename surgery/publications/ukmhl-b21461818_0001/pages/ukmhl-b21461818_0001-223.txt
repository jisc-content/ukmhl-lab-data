FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE. I2J This kind of injury is divifible into twQ general heads, viz. thofe in which the broken parts keep their proper level, or equality of lurface, with the reft of the fcull, and thofc in which they do not; or, in other words, fra<5tures' without 'depreffion, and fradlures with. Thefe two diftin£lions are ajl which are T^t^iy nidceffary to be made, and will be found to comprehend every violent / divifion of the parts of the fcull, (not made by a cutting- ^nftrument) from the fineft capillaiy fifiure, pp to the moft comphcated fraclure : for fif- fures and fradlures, differing from each other only in the width of the breach, or in the diftance of the feparated parts, and the difpov fition of broken pieces, in large fra£iures, be- ing fubjed to an alnioft infinite variety, dif- fin£lions and appellations drawn and made from thefe circumftances might be multiplied to even three times the old number, without impai ing the fmalleft degree of ufeful know- ledge to the man, who fliould be at the pains to get them by heart. What are the lymptoms of a fradlured cra- nium ? is often alked; and there is hardly any one who does not, from the authority of writers.

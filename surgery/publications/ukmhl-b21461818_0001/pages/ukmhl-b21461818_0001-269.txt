FROM EXTERNAL VlOLtNCE. M 3 or i cannot "fee any vindicable reafon for operat- inor at all P. The chirurgical intention in perforating the fcull, in the cafe of fimpie luideprefled fra6lures, is, as I have ah'Tsady obferved, either to give immediate difcharge to a fluid fup- pofed to be extravafated between the cranium ^nd membranes of the brain; or to obviate and prevent fuch illsj, as may moft probahly be expe6ted to arife from the contufion cauf- iiig the fradlure ; or to let out matter already formed in confequence of the inflammation following fuch contufion.

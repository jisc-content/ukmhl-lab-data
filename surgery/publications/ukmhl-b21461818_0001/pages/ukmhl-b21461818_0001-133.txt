On the right fide a portion of the dura mater was become floughy, about the breadth of a fhilling; and under this altered part, was matter between the two meninges. The more firm attachment of the dura mater at the futures, renders the feparation of it at thefe places very difficult: which circumftance, added to the conlideration of the fituation of the fagittal future on the very top of the head, renders the application of the trephine on each fide of it often abfo- lutely neceflkry.

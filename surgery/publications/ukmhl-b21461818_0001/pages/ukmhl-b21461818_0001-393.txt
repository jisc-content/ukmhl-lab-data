The membrane which lines this facculus and duÂ£t, is in its ftrufture much like to the membrana pituitaria narium, from the fur- face of which a clear vifcid mucus is fecretcd, and by which the fucculus and paffages are conflantly moiftened and kept pervious. While the parts are in a healthy, found ftate, the fluid fecreted by the lachrymal gland paffes off through the pun6la, facculus, and dud:, into the nofe, without any trouble; but when they are in a difeafed ftate .the cafe is otherwife.

440 REMARKS ON FRACTURES not admitting the fmalleft degree of motion without great pain, perfed quietude becomes as necelTary as frequent dreffmg. The the air fufFered to enter, it is more than probable that the ufual bad fymptoms would have aiifen ; for the danger in compound fradures does not depend on the fize of the wound. If air gets in, a fraall wound is equally bad as a large one, perhaps worfe, by confining the matter after it is colleded. I have mentioned this cafe as it occprs on the inftant; but could adduce many more, in which equal fuccefs has attended this mode of prac- tice.

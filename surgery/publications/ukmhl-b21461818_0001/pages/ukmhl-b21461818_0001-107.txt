FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE* and it may alfo be worth while in this place to remark, that if the blow was. on or very near to a future, and the fubje6t young, the faid future will often feparate in fuch manner as to let through it a loofe, painful, ill-na- tured fungus; at which time alio it is no un- common thing for the patient's head and face to be attacked with an eryfipelas.' I have faid, that in thofe cafes in which the fcalp is very .little injured by the bruife, and in which there is no wound, nor any immediately alarming fymptoms or appear- ances, that the patient feels little or no in- convenience, and feldom makes any com- plaint, until fome few days are paft. That at the end of this uncertain time, he is gene- rally attacked by the lymptoms already re- cited ; that thefe are not preffing at flrft, but that they foon increafe to fuch a degree, as to baffle all ,our art: from whence it will ap- pear, that when this is the cafe, the patient frequently fuffers from what feems at firft to indicate his fafety, and prevents fuch attempts being made, and fuch care from being taken * " Suturas tempore curationis disjungi grave eft."

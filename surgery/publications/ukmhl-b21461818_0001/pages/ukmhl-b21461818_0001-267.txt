FROM i:XTERNAL VIOLENCE. l6l the place from whence the piece fl-iould be removed^ in order to examine the bone ; and, even although ho fra<flure fhould be found, is an authority and vindication of fuch oper- ation*, efpecially if the general fymptoms v/ere at all urgent, fuch fymptoms implying mifchief fomewhere, and fuch external mark rendering it clear^ where the external violence caufing fuch mifchief was infliaed. But all the antient, and many of the modern writers, fpeak of a particular kind of fradlure, in which the fcalp covering it is perfedly fair and un- injtfrfed ; and this they call a contra-hflure. By the general account it is pretty clear, that the majority of thofe who have fpoken of this kind of fracture have fuppofed that the breach made in the bone was moll: frequently in the part of the cranium diametrically oppofite to that which received the blow ; this the term contra-fiflure implies, and this they mofi: cer- tanily do in general m^an fhould be under- frood by it, as appears by their direding us to examine and to remove the oppofite part of the fcalp, if no mifchief be found under the part ftncken, and the patient labours under what are called the fymptoms of a fradured fcull.

FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE. 69 very ill the following night, and next morn- ins: was delirious. The tumor now was more rifen, contained palpably a fluid, but was by no means tenfe; I took away the whole tu- mid piece, by a circular incifion, gave dlf- charge to a thin brown fanies, and found the cranium perfectly naked, altered confiderably in colour from that of a healthy natural one, but without fiffure, fradlure, or other evil. That whole night and next day he was delirious ; his fkin burning hot; he had frequent fpafms, which fhook his whole frame, and the next night (the 17th) he died. The whole fcalp, except round the edge of the incifion, was in a natural ftate ; the peri- cranium in every other part, except the tu- mid one, adhered to the bone; and neither inflammation, nor tumor of any kind, all over the reft of the head. Under that part of the fcull from which the pericranium had been detached, and from which the Icalp had been removed, a very confiderable colledion of matter was found lying between the dura mater and cranium, but no appearance of difeafe any where elfe.

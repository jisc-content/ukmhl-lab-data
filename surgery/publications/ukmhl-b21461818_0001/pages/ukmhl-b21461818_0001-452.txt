344 OBSERVATIONS OJf THE The longer time the patient can be pre- vailed upon to we^r. the bougie,, the more likely will be the continuance of the opeipng; and when it is withdrawn, the external ori- fice fhould be covered only by a fuperficial pledget or plafter, and fufFered to heal under moderate preffure.. There is another method which has been much recommended by fome French writers to prevent the doling of the opening in the os unguis:. which is, to introduce a cannula either of gold or filver, or lead into the aper-. ture, and to permit the fore to heal over it, fufFering the cannula to remain, or to come away by the nofe. For my own part I cannot fay any thing to it, having never had occafion to try it; the c^fes of this kind which I have had under my diredion, having generally fucceeded under fome of the methods already mentioned;- which methods will frequently prove fucceff- ful, if the furgeon is clear in his attention, purfues it fteadily and properly, and refrains from doing too much ; though I muft agaia ' repeat what I have faid before, viz. that there -is no method of treating this diforder which is 7 infallible.

FROM EXTERNAL VIOLENCE. 265 CASE XLI. I A CHILD about nine years old received a blow from a cricket-bat on the upper part of his forehead, which brought him to the ground, and deprived him of fenfe. I found him with a conliderable tumor on his forehead, and conlidering the ftate he was in, would have removed immediately a part of the fcalp; but a dabbler in furgery, who was a relation, undertook to cure him by an application. On the third day I was fent for again, and found him nearly in the fame ftate as I left him. I divided the fcalp, and found a frafture with depreffion. By means of the trephine and elevator the deprefled part was raifed, and the dura mater being found in a very good ftate, and no apparent extravafation in the cafe, nothing more was done at that time. Proper medicines were ordered to procure ftools. The next day his fymptoms were the fame, except that his pulfe was lefs la- bouring, and he had not the apopleftic flertor, which he had till then. 1 examined the bone, which lay perfeftly fmooth, nor was the dura mater at all elevated into the perforation. 6 31ood

AND DISLOCATIONS. 439 Compound fradtures in general require to be drelled every day; and the wounded parts not fcones are placed in their proper ifttuatlon, and by keepiuig it clofe with flips of flicking plafter; or in fome cafes futures may be employed with advantage; it fhould then be covered with proper drefiings, fuch as dry lint and fedative applications, avoiding every thing greafy. Thefe firft drefiings Ihould not be removed for many days, unlefs a colleftion of matter makes it neceffary to change them. By thefe means the wounds in the foft parts may often be brought to heal by the firlt inten- tion; and thus compound fractures, unattended with the ufual Jong train of evils which Mr. Pott has fo well defcribed, will frequently unite, and give no more trouble than fimple frac- tures. The fortunate termination of the compound frafture in his own I-eg, was probably owing to the air being excluded; but this arofe from the nature of the fradlure, rather than from the manner in which it was treated, as the idea of preventing the firft admiflion of air, in thefe cafes, was not at that time attended to; though, while they were changing their drefiings, by means of lamps and other contrivances, our forefathers endea- voured to corredl its pernicious effbds, which they afcribed to cold. In Mr. Pott's cafe, the faft was, that the bone had made its way through the fkin at a difiance from the fradlure ; fo that, when it was returned into its place, the foft parts clofed, and prevented the air from getting in ; by which means the wound healed by the firft intention I have now under my care a man who had a compound frafture of the leg ; the wound was fmall, eafily clofed, and kept fo by fticking plafter; ' as no bad fymptoms followed, the firft dreffings were fuftered to re- main a fortnight, at the end of which time the wound was found healed, and the bones firm. Had it not been thus treated, on tJie contrary, had the drefiings been removed, and V*^' ^4 the

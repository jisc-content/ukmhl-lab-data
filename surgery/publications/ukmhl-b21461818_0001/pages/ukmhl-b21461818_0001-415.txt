FISTULA LACHRYMALIS. By the ifnproper life of medicines of the latter kind, it frequently happened that the (kin became inflamed and bur ft; the dif- charge which neceflarily followed this acci- dent, together with the heated appearance of the parts about, confirmed their opinion of a colledioil of matter within ; and according to fuch fuppofition, they attempted to obtain a cure by dilating the orifice, and endeavouring to make an incarnation from the bottom of the hollow : not being acquainted with the " thered from the method of cure, in which, univerfals pre- " mifed, fuch as bleedings, purgings, Sec. you may attempt " to diflblve the humour by fome gentle anodyne, or difcutient " cataplafm, but if it inflame and fuppurate, you mull haflen " maturation, as well as the difcharge, by reafon of the part " it lies upon; but when, notwithftanding all your endeavours " to incarn and agglutinate, the matter continues to difcharge " itfelf, not only by the outward orifice, but alfo under the " cilium into the eye, you muft try fome more powerful defic- " cative." I believe no one will venture to fay, that the nature and feat of the difeafe is more or better explained by what the Doftor has faid, than by the Serjeant; and I think it is perfedly cler,r that neither of them had any true idea of it at all; they both millook the caruncle for the lachrymal gland, and the difeafe for an encyfted, or a fcrophulous tumor, which ought to be brought to fuppuration ; the lachrymal fac, the duftus ad nares. their ufe, and the diforder of them creating the complaint in queftion, they were totally unacquainted with. ^ 2 fituatiou

18 W. W. KEEN have exhausted our resources in pheripheral operations; or till a larger surgical experience shows that the removal of the entire ganglion will cure permanently, and a better sur- gical technique greatly lessens the present mortality. IV. A few points in technique. — a) Access to the cra- nial cavity. — There is no question in my mind that either Fig. 8. — Shows the natural size of the piece of iodoform gauze (37 x 6 inches) packed in the cavity of the skin for three days without harm; seen edgewise. the Hartley-Krause operation, or the operation Doyen (which I have never yet attempted), or an operation somewhat ana- logous to it described by Poirier in Chipaiilt’s Travaux de Neurologie chirurgicale, vol. II, 1897, p. 213, is the prefe- rable one. All of these approach the ganglion from the side, and by lifting the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. By no possibility can one work with the same advantage, either as to light or facility of manipulation, by Bose’s method. Whether the flap shall be raised by chisel, or drill, or saw, I think is a matter largely of preference of each individual operator.

PATHOLOGICAL REPORT 33 in which the third branch of the fifth had been resected in the portion which contains this root, would also be of value, if done some years after the operation. Should no degeneration of the motor root be found, there would be some evidence that the ascending degeneration had not been important, for this ascending degeneration is not li- mited to sensory fibres. Krause could demonstrate changes in the sensory fifth root only in one case. In Case VI, which I have examined, the sensory root is perfectly normal. The cells of the Gasse- rian ganglion, have each a single axis cylinder, which, at a short distance from the cell body, divides, and one branch passes centrally, and the other peripherally. If, therefore, the lesion is primarily within the ganglion cells, we cannot understand why only the peripheral branches of the axis cylinders are diseased, while the central branches remain normal. The same objection has been raised against the ganglionic theory for the commencement of tabes in the spinal ganglia, only in the latter case the central branches of the axis cylinders are diseased, and the peripheral, as a rale, are intact. The great and durable improvement, occurring in many cases of trifacial neuralgia after removal of the Gasserian ganglion, would seem to indicate that the cause of the suf- fering is to be sought, at least in many cases, in the Gasse- rian ganglion, but it by no means follows that we may expect to find lesions of the ganglion in every case, any more than we may hope to find lesions of the spinal ganglia in every case of tabes in which there has been pain, unless the employment of the method of Nissl changes our views. We know that a lesion within the cerebrum may pro- duce intense pain as Edinger21, Biernacki22, and Kirchhoff23 have shown, and Gowers24 states that, in a case known to him, irritation of the sensory nucleus of the fifth nerve in 5

27 PATHOLOGICAL REPORT than in the preceding case, in which they are not espe- cially striking. The medullary sheaths of the nerve fibres in many places are greatly swollen. Many nerve bundles contain very small nerve fibres; many are entirely deprived of nerve fibres, and contain merely connective tissue; and many contain swollen medullary sheaths without axis cylinders. The small vessels have thickened walls, and some are entirely closed by proliferated tissue. Case VIII. Some of the vessels are sclerotic, but there is little change in the nerve fibres. The smaller ganglion cells are abnormally abundant. In some places the medullary sheaths are somewhat swollen. Case IX. The findings in this case consist of swollen medullary sheaths, diseased axis cylinders, proliferated connective tissue in the nerve bundles, with destruction of nerve fibres, and altered ganglion cells. Only a portion of the ganglion has been obtained, but it is sufficient for the purposes of microscopical study. The cells and their capsules in certain parts, can be distinguished with difficulty from the surround- ing tissue; in other parts they are much more distinct; it is frequently impossible to detect nuclei or nucleoli, and one might well doubt whether he were examining ganglionic tissue, were it not for the fact that here and there a nerve cell is detected. The intercellular tissue has replaced the ganglion cells. The blood vessels are much altered, as may be seen in Figure //. In this vessel the media and intima are much thickened, and the latter has almost entirely filled the lumen of the vessel, leaving several smaller passages for the current

34 W. G. SPILLER the pons seemed to be the cause of the suffering in the face. Indeed Gowers says distinctly that we know nothing of the sensory function of the posterior ganglia, and are justified in looking to the nerve cells within the cerebrospinal axis as the seat of the morbid process. In a case of trifacial neuralgia, therefore, attention should be directed, not only to the condition of the Gasserian ganglion, but also, if possible, to that of the sensory nucleus of the fifth nerve, and to the spinal root. We must acknowledge, it seems to me, that pain is not the usual manifestation of a lesion confined to the brain or cord, and, indeed, the presence of pain in cases of suspected hematomyelia leads one to diagnosticate hematorrhachis. We do not, as a rule, find pain in chronic degenerative processes of the cord, which respect the posterior roots and meninges, as for instance in syringomyelia, but we find it as an early symptom of tabes, which is also a chronic pro- cess, but one which affects the posterior roots. As Gowers states, vascular dilatation attends functional activity, and it is probably also true that vascular dilata- tion, if not excessive and too prolonged, causes functional activity. Excessive functional activity of sensory cells may be manifested as pain, but it is possibly equally true that diminution, or imperfect quality of the blood supply, may be a cause of pain. How can we better explain the fre- quent headache of anemia? If, therefore, we find altera- tion of the blood vessels within the ganglia, we may, with reasonable suspicion, look upon the condition, in part at least, as the cause of the pain, and may believe that peri- pheral irritation, which under normal conditions would not be perceived, would be sufficient to produce painful sensations. As yet, as far as I am able to judge from my researches in the literature, the Gasserian ganglion excised from a case of trifacial neuralgia has never been examined by the

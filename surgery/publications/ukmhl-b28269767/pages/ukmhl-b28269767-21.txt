ON KESECTION OF THE GASSEBIAN GANGLION 19 b) Hemorrhage. — In three instances I have done the operation in two stages on account of hemorrhage, packing iodoform gauze into the skull in these cases. The amount of gauze which I have used has surprised me very much. In one case it was 37 by G inches, or 222 square in- ches of gauze (fig. 8); in a second 23 by 14 inches, or 322 square inches; in a third 267 square inches; and in a fourth a piece 16 by 6, or 96 square inches. I mention this to show what an amount of pressure the brain will stand, but I also mention it to condemn the process if it is possible to avoid it. The danger of infection is always considerable in any case in which the skull cavity has to be reopened. Moreover, I think we ought always Fig. 9. — Allis’s blunt dissector. to avoid testing the power of the brain to stand pressure if we can. I join, therefore, heartily with Krause in urging that the operation shall be completed in a single sitting if possible. Hemorrhage from the middle meningeal has almost in- variably taken place in all of my operations, either by una- voidable tearing of the vessel, in turning down the flap, or, as happened three times, by the tearing of the vessel at the foramen spinosum. In the latter case, the simple use of the Allis blunt dissector (1) (Figure 9) to block up the vessel for a moment by the curved end, and later the substi- tution first of the left forefinger, and then of a small bit ot (1) This most useful yet simple surgical instrument is not as well known as it deserves to be, hence I figure it here. In all blunt dissections, which are so largely employed, it is simply invaluable, especially by the facility with which adhesion are torn through by its curved end.

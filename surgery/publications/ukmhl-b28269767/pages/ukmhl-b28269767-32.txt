W. G. SPILLER 30 The investigations by Thoma 3 of the blood vessels from the painful areas in snpraobital neuralgia, and his expla- nation for their sclerotic condition, are most interesting. Rose 4 has also remarked on the size of the vessels and the substantial thickness of their walls in some of the cases on which he operated. He found great alteration of the peripheral nerves in trifacial neuralgia. The appearances were those of chronic neuritis, and were often more marked at the peripheral, than at the central end of the nerves. Microscopical alteration of the peripheral branches of the fifth nerve in cases of tic douloureux have also been noticed by Tuffier5, De Schweinitz6, Horsley7, Tripiers, Putnam Krause 10, etc, and macroscopical changes have been detected by Tuffier u, Mears 12 Tripier 13, Keen 14, etc. Krause’s 15 book is the most thorough which has as yet appeared on trifacial neuralgia. Though he found altera- tions in branches of the fifth nerve which had been slowly twisted out, he was unable to detect changes in the vessels. Krause observed marked lesions in the Gasserian glanglion in cases of tic douloureux, but only in one case could he demonstrate changes in the sensory fifth root, and in this case after the pain had disappeared on one side of the face, as a result of excision of the ganglion, it recurred on the other. Krause could not find the sclerosis of the ganglion, which other writers describe, and which certainly exists in one of Keen’s cases (Case IX). In six of Krause’s seven cases, resection of the nerves had preceded, by some years, the excision of the ganglion, and he justly compares his findings with those seen after amputation, but he regards them as too intense to be me- rely secondary; he thinks the question cannot be positively settled until a ganglion is examined, the peripheral nerves of which have never been resected. This examination has been made in Case VIII of this paper. In none of Krause’s

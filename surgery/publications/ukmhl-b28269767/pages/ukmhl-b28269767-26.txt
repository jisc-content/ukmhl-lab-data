24 W. G. SPILLER Case V. The nerve fibres are greatly altered, in many the me- dullary sheaths are much swollen, and no traces of axis cylinders can be seen; in others the latter are represented by irregular and separate masses of a hyaline-like red substance, which have little resemblance to normal axis cylinders. Many nerve sheaths are entirely empty. The vessels are sclerotic, and some of the smaller ones are enti- rely closed. The ganglion cells are in different stages of degeneration; some are faintly stained and have very in- distinct outlines, and there are numerous spaces in which the cells have entirely disappeared. Some of the nerve cells are very small, and without nuclei and nucleoli, and the connective tissue between them is increased in amount. The pericellular spaces seem to be somewhat larger than in normal ganglia, and appear as if the cells had shrunken away from their capsules. No very great difference can be noticed in the condition of the second and third branches of the nerve, for they seem to be nearly equally diseased. Case YE. The ganglion, removed from Case 6, presents on mi- croscopical examination most distinct evidences of degene- ration. The medullary sheaths on many of the intragan- glionic fibres are greatly swollen, and the fibres have an irregular, beaded appearance in longitudinal sections. Some bundles, cut transversely, contain masses of medullary substance varying greatly in size, and of most irregular form, and without a trace of axis cylinders. Stained by the method of Azoulay or Weigert, these masses of medullary substance stand out prominently, and it is noticed that frequently they are not continuous with

PATHOLOGICAL EEPOET 25 one another, but that they are connected by empty and contracted nerve sheaths. There is no great increase in the number of the nuclei of the sheaths of Schwann. Normal bundles of fibres are found lying close to fibres very greatly degenerated. It is impossible to find any greater alteration of the fibres belonging to the second than of those belonging to the third branch of the trifa- cial nerve. The sensory and motor roots are normal, the nerve fibres in these roots present medullary sheaths which stain well, and have normal outlines. Longitudinal and transverse sections of the motor and sensory roots, and of the second and third branches of the nerve, have been obtained; the first branch had been broken olf close to the ganglion at the time of the operation. Transverse sections of the motor and sensory roots pre- sent the usual number of nerve fibres, each with an axis cylinder surrounded by a medullary sheath, and separated from the other by a moderate amount of connective tissue. The contrast afforded by the transverse sections of the second and third branches, with those of the sensory and motor roots, is most striking. In the second branch, especially, the irregular and large masses of medullary sub- stance are very distinct, and in many bundles it is impos- sible to detect axis cylinders. Atrophied fibres seem to pre- dominate in the transverse sections of the third branch, though in longitudinal sections, a little nearer the ganglion, the swollen medullary sheaths are as visible as in the second branch. The ganglion was cut longitudinally in such a manner that its relation to the second and third branches, and the sensory root, are shown in a single section. In some intraganglionic nerve bundles, axis cylinders may be found greatly swollen, and occurring in irregular masses of a pinkish hue when the carmine is employed as stain, but these masses are more numerous in certain bundles. 4

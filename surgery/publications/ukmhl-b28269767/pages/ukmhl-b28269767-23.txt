ON RESECTION OF THE GASSERIAN GANGLION 21 either foreign bodies get into the eye, or, as in one of my cases, a bandage over the eye may rub the cornea, and thus produce ulceration and the destruction of the cornea. The use of the Buller shield is so thoroughly satisfactory, both in protecting the eye and in keeping it moist, that I think any one who has tried it will be unwilling to dispense with it afterward. Its use should be continued for from ten to thirty days after the operation.

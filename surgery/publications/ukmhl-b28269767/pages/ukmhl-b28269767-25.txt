PROFESSOR SPILLER’S PATHOLOGICAL REPORT From the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphiay U. S. A. Little attention has been paid to the microscopical examination of the Gasserian ganglia removed from patients suffering from tic douloureux. Indeed, with the exception of a few cases, we have had almost no information fur- nished us on the pathological condition of these structures in the disease. It was, therefore, with a feeling of the deepest interest that I undertook the examination of the ganglia removed by Professor Keen from seven cases of prosopalgia. This report is based on a study of several hundred sections. The stains employed have been carmine, hema- toxylin (Delafield’s and AVeigert’s), osmic acid (methods of Azoulay and of Marchi), thionin, acid fuchsin and eosin. The method of Rosin has given most satisfactory results for a study of the nerve fibres, and in some cases, in which the material did not stain readily with carmine, Delafield’s hematoxylin, with an after-stain of acid fuchsin, presented beautifully colored specimens. Unfortunately, the method of Nissl could not be employed, as all the ganglia had been placed in Muller’s fluid. The method of Azoulay proved to be of great service, for in some cases in which the method of Weigert did not give thoroughly satisfactory results, the former yielded sections well stained.

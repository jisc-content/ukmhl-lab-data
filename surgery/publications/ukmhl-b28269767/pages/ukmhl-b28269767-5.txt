ON RESECTION OF THE GASSERIAN GANGLION Up to the present time I have done eleven operations for the removal of the Gasserian ganglion. The first of these cases was reported in the Transactions of the Philadelph ia County Medical Society for 1894 and in the Medical and Surgical Reporter for March 1894 in conjunction with Dr. John K. Mitchell. It was the fourteenth operation done on the patient. From the date of that operation, October 18th, 1893, the patient has been well, though his condition of mental anxiety lest the pain should return and his mental instability as a result of his long continued use of opium are very marked, yet practically he is well of his neuralgia. He still has pain, but not the old tic. In the American Journal of the Medical Sciences for January 1896, I reported five additional cases. The later history of these cases is as follows : Case II. The operation was done June 18th, 1894. No ganglionic cells or nerve fibres were found in the tissue supposed to have been removed from the site of the ganglion. The pain returned in six months, though not so badly as before. It still continues. (September 1897).

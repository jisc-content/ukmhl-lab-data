ON RESECTION OF THE GASSERIAN GANGLION 17 could not be examined microscopically. If the ganglion is not diseased, therefore, primarily, I believe that we ought to attack the disease where we know it exists, namely,â€” in the peripheral branches. If the ganglion is primarily diseased, we cannot understand how it is that relief is afforded for one, two, or three years. The simple shock of the operation would not keep a diseased ganglion quiescent for months or years. My own conviction, based on examinations so far made, is that the disease in many cases, at least, is primarily pe- ripheral, and that the ganglion is involved by extension upward. In those cases in which some local growth is found on the branches of the fifth nerve, the cause of the pain must, of course, be peripheral, and we have no means of detecting the presence of such a lesion previous to opera- tion. I would, therefore, urge not only that the removal of the Gasserian ganglion should be the last operation, but I would specially urge that peripheral operations be done early. Most operations for tic douloureux are made two, three, five, ten, or even twenty years after the disease began, and after vain attempts have been made to cure by drugs. My own view decidedly is that if after the disease has positively existed for so long a period as three or four months, and if during this time, while drugs mayhave re- lieved, they have not cured it, I would wait no longer, but instantly do the peripheral operation in hope of arresting the peripheral disease and preventing its upward course, which, in time, will result in its finally involving the ganglion. When we remember the fact that all peripheral operations are virtually without any danger to life, and that they re- lieve for a considerable time, and that we are in a position now to state that the mortality of Gasserian operations is over 20 per cent., and that in a small percentage of cases even the removal of the Gasserian ganglion may not surely and permanently cure, I think we are in a position to say that the removal of the ganglion should not be done till we 3

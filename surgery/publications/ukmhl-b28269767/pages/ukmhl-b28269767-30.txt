28 W. G. SPILLER of blood. In the process of hardening the inner coats at one portion have contracted, and withdrawn from the outer, leaving an open space. Case X. The medullary sheaths, in certain parts of the sections, are enormously swollen, and the axis cylinders have been almost entirely destroyed and removed, leaving small lumps of a pinkish hyaline substance here and there. Many nerve sheaths may be found in which the medullary substance and axis cylinders have entirely disappeared. The vessels seem to be less affected than in the other cases in which evidences of intense degeneration have been noticed. The ganglion cells have indistinct outlines, and some stain very faintly. The intercellular tissue is increased in amount, and, throughout the sections in which the ganglion cells are found, numerous granular corpuscles are noticed. Case XI. The ganglion cells are vacuolated, but do not appear to be greatly altered, nor are the cell capsules notably thickened. In portions of certain sections nerve bundles are found in a high degree of degeneration; the medullary sheaths have almost entirely disappeared, leaving only gra- nular masses here and there; the axis cylinders are swollen, and the connective tissue and empty nerve sheaths occupy a large portion of the fields. The vessels are somewhat altered. * * * In six of the cases just described the lesions are of an intense degree and unquestionable. In a seventh case (Case VIII) they are much less distinct.

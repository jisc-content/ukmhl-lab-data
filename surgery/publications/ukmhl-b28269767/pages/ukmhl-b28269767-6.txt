4 W. W. KEEN Case III. Died in a week from septic infection Case IV. The operation was done May 23rd, 1895 and at present, September 29th, 1897, she is entirely well. Of cases V and VI, I append a brief summary, since the examination of the specimens from these two cases is an important part of the pathological report which follows. Of the remaining live cases (VII to XI inclusive), which have never been reported, I give only a brief resume of each sufficient to compare with the pathological report. I shall publish them more fully hereafter. In conjunction with my own remarks on the removal of the ganglion and as a very important addition to our know- ledge of the pathology of tic douloureux, I have been so fortunate as to secure the cooperation of my friend, Prof. William G. Spiller, who has examined with great care the seven specimens which I had removed, and which were as yet nnexamined. In all of these ganglionic t issue was found. These specimens cover the cases V and VI of my second paper, and all the live additional cases (VII-XI inclusive) here briefly reported. I consider myself most fortunate in being able to enlist the services of so accomplished a neuro- pathologist as Prof. Spiller, and the value of his contribu- tion will be seen not only in the text, but in the beautiful illustrations, for which we are indebted to the skill of Miss A. G. Newbold. It will be observed that of the eleven, ten were secondary operations, multiple peripheral operations have been done in all the cases before the ganglion itself was attacked, with the exception of one case (Case VIII). In this case,

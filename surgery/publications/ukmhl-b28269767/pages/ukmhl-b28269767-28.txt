2G W. G. SPILLER The process has evidently reached a stage in which the swollen axis cylinders have in large part been removed. The connective tissue about, and between, the bundles of nerve fibres is not very excessive, but is increased to some extent between the individual fibres. The ganglion cells are somewhat more irregular in outline, the smaller cells are more numerous, and the pe- ricellular spaces are larger than in normal ganglia. Many cells contain vacuoles, but the nuclei are not excentric, and the nucleolus can usually be seen. The pigmentation of the cells is not excessive, and the capsules of the cells do not appear to be much thickened, nor are their nuclei unusually numerous. The intercellular tissue is not notably increased. In some places the cells are very small and faintly stained, though a few appear unusually large and swollen, but these are comparatively rare. The most striking alteration of the cells is the atrophy with the enlargement of the pericellular spaces, of which the latter may be due to changes which have occured after removal of the gan- glion. The small vessels in many parts of the ganglion are greatly altered, some are completely closed by the prolife- ration of the tissue in the walls of the vessels, while others show only a slight alteration. Case VII. The ganglion cells are most irregular in shape, and appear to be somewhat more separated than normally from one another by overgrowth of the intercellular connective tissue. Some of the cells are not sharply defined from the surrounding tissue, and some do not contain distinct nuclei or nucleoli. In some places the ganglion cells have been destroyed and removed, in others the cells contain much pigment and some vacuoles. The cellular changes are greater

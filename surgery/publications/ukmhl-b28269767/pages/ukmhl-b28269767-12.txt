W. W. KEEN 10 a handkerchief without the shield produced friction on the cornea followed by a corneal ulcer, from which he ultimately lost his eyesight. Has been entirely free from pain up to the present time, October 1 , 1807. Fig. 7. — Case XI. The larger reticulated mass to the right is the Gasserian ganglion. The detached piece is the II division. * * * To sum up the results of Prof. Spiller’s researches, we may say that, in a general way, the pathological changes which he has found are: First. That the medullary substance of the nerve fibre within the ganglion and its branches is immensely swollen, atrophied, or entirely gone, depending on the intensity of the disease Secondly. That the axis cylinders similarly are mar- kedly degenerated or entirely destroyed. Thirdly. That the cells of the ganglion itself, in at least one case, are so degenerated, or atrophied, that there would even be doubt whether we were dealing with ganglionic tissue were it not for the occasional nerve cells seen. Fourthly. That the vessels are very distinctly sclerotic. In one instance the lumen is even entirely obliterated.

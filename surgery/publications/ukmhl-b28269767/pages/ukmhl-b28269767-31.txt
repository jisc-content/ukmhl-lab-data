29 PATHOLOGICAL REPORT The lesions in the Gasserian ganglion, in the more ad- vanced cases of tic douloureux, consist of enormously swollen medullary sheaths and axis cylinders, nerve bundles in which the nerve elements have been destroyed, and only connective tissue is left, atrophied ganglion cells, cells faintly stained, without nuclei or nucleoli, and sclerosed blood vessels in some cases even without a lumen. In all the specimens examined, numerous red blood corpuscles are observed, which doubtless owe their position within the tissues to the surgical interference. The pathology of tic douloureux has not been well known. Some have held that it is a neurosis; others that it is a neuralgia, though this distinction is not very clear; and still others, that it is a neuritis. Some have believed that the disease is a peripheral one, and others that the primary lesion is within the ganglion. There is always a possibility that in some cases the lesion may be a cen- tral one. Putnam says that, as a rule, neuritis is present in tri- facial neuralgia, and probably exists far oftener than we think. This seems to me exceedingly probable for the divi- ding line between neuralgia and neuritis cannot be sharply drawn. One, we are told, is a functional, the other, an organic process; but « functional » is a very comprehensive term. Putnam 1 states that of late years physicians have been more favorable to the view that, in chronic forms of neuralgia at least, the pain is simply the expression of the inflammation of a nerve. Dana 2 placed much more value on the condition of the blood vessels than on inflammatory changes in the nerve fibres. In a recent communication to the writer he expresses the opinion that trifacial neuralgia is due to degenerative neuritis of the peripheral sensory neurones of the fifth nerve, depending on, or associated with, obliterating arteritis.

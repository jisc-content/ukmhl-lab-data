ON RESECTION ON THE GASSERIAN GANGLION 11 Fifthly. There is, in at least one case, a decided amount of increase in the connective tissue of the ganglion, which is enough to call the alteration a distinct sclerosis. * * * I propose to take up four points. First. Should the Gasserian ganglion be removed? Secondly. The answer being in the affirmative, to what extent shall it be removed, i. e. shall we remove the entire ganglion, or only its outer two thirds, or shall we be satis- fied with simply « breaking it up » by blunt instruments or a curette? Thirdly. Should the ganglion be removed as a primary operation, or should its removal be reserved till the very last operation for tic douloureux? Fourthly. A few points in the technique. The removal of the Gasserian ganglion is in some re- spects rather peculiarly American. The first deliberate pro- posal to remove the Gasserian ganglion was made by Dr. J. Ewing Mears of Philadelphia (Transactions American Sur- gical Association, 1884, Yol. II, p. 469). Andrew of Chicago (Chicago Medical Record, 1891, Vol. I, p. 322) had been at work for eighteen months de vising practically the same opera- tion as Rose, but the latter preceded him both in publication and performance [Lancet, 1890, Vol. II, p. 914). Similary Hartley of New York, and Krause of Altona, almost at the same time devised the method of operating which has been the most used, and is, on the whole, perhaps the best method. Of the 108 cases of intracranial operations on the fifth nerve collected by Tiffany (Transactions American Sur- gical Association, 1896, Yol. XIV, p. 1; and Annals of Sur- gery: 1896, Vol. XXIV, p. 575) 79 were done by American surgeons, and 29 by European surgeons. I. Whether we ought still to resect the ganglion depends, in my opinion, on three conditions: a) the mortality of the

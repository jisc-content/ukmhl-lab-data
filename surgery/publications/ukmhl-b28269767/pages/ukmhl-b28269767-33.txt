PATHOLOGICAL REPORT 31 cases did the neuralgia return after excision of the ganglion, even within three and a half years after the operation, and as the peripheral operations did not give permanent relief, and extirpation of the ganglion did do so, he thinks it is allowable to conclude that the cause is to be sought in the Gasserian ganglion. It seems to me quite possible that the trouble may first be peripheral, and, as resection gives only temporary relief, the recurrence of the pain may be due to extension of the morbid process to the ganglion. Krause is disposed to regard the changes in the ganglion partly as primary, and partly as secondary from the re- section. The fact that nerve degeneration may extend beyond the spinal ganglia, and affect the posterior roots, must make us prepared for the possibility of an extension of a similar process after extirpation of the Gasserian ganglion. - Other investigators, who have found lesions of the Gas- serian ganglion, are Wedl, Rose, Podrazky and Laveran, Horsley, Putnam, and Antonino Dâ€™Antona (all cited by Krause). The possibility of the changes in the ganglion being- secondary, as Krause suggests, is not to be lightly passed over. Lugaro16 has shown that the nerve cells of the spinal ganglia undergo marked alteration after lesions of the pe- ripheral fibres, and the spinal ganglia are so similar to the Gasserian that the results of these experiments may be applied to the latter. Fleming has noticed that the cells of the ganglia, on the posterior nerve roots in rabbits and dogs, undergo definite changes as the result of nerve section, or of ligature, and do so at a much earlier period than do the multipolar cells in the cord, beginning, probably, as early as the fourth day, and certainly by the seventh day. The nucleus, and some- times the nucleolus also, become small, and the nucleus

W. G. SPILLER 36 this respite the ganglion cannot be greatly diseased. No branch of the fifth nerve is sharply limited to any one portion of the Gasserian ganglion, and were the ganglion primarily diseased, the resection of one branch would not remove the peripheral irritation transmitted by the other branches to the hypersensitive cells. There can be no doubt that intense alteration of a chronic, inflammatory character may be found in the Gas- serian ganglion in certain cases of tic douloureux, and also that the sensory root in such cases may be intact. This, it seems to me, is a satisfactory explanation for the relief of pain experienced by many patients in whom the ganglia have been excised. The removal of diseased cells within the Gasserian gan- glion, which are capable of responding abnormally to every peripheral irritation, may well be attended with the relief of joain. Excision of the ganglion destroys at once the paths of painful sensation from a large area. The integrity of the sensory root, in the case in which the whole ganglion was removed by Professor Keen, is a fact of considerable importance. It teaches that, though the ganglion may be greatly diseased, the process may be arres- ted at this point. In the other case in which the sensory root was examined, the only other case (Krause) in which it is positively stated that such an examination was made (though Krause may have examined the sensory root in some of his other cases) the fibres were found diseased, and the process extended to the other side of the face. This report, and the four cases (one reported by Rose, two by Keen, and one by Dana) in which the pain returned after removal of the ganglion, though we are not sure that all portions of the ganglion were excised in these cases, must make us prepared for the possibility of a renewal of the suffering in some instances, even after the excision of the Gasserian ganglion.

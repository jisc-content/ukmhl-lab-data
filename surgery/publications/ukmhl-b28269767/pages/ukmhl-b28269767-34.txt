32 W. Gr. SPILLER may be excentric, and even bulge the cell wall. The cliro- mophilic granules are altered, the cells atrophy, and the pericellular lymph spaces become enlarged. Just here, we may mention, however, that Lenhossek’s17 recent studies on fresh spinal ganglia, obtained from an executed man, have taught us that when the ganglia are properly hardened such pericellular lymph spaces do not exist. Fleming 18 also says that large vacuoles are found in some cells. He thinks it is quite comprehensible that the cells of the ganglia should suffer before the cells of the anterior horns, inasmuch as nerve impulses pass normally to them from the site of the lesion. Kowalewsky 19 cut the sciatic nerve in animals, and in- jected a few drops of a 5 °/0 chromic acid solution into the central end. The animals were killed two to four days later, and the chromophilic bodies of the cells of the spinal gan- glia were found much altered. If', therefore, such alterations of the ganglion cells occur within a few days after resection of the nerve, we may expect greater changes when the time which has elapsed since the operation is reckoned by years, instead of days. And yet, it is possible that some of the lesions of the gan- glion cells, which have been described, are only of a tem- porary character. Neuritis may ascend. It seems that the jjossibility of this, though often disputed, must be acknowledged. M.lle de Majewska 20 has recently written a thesis on the subject. She states tat the lesions of ascending neuritis are the same as those of ordinary peripheral neuritis; viz. fragmentation of the myelin, multiplication of the nuclei, and alteration of the axis cylinders. There is no reason why this neuritis should not extend to the cells of the Gasserian ganglion. It would be well, of course, to examine an entire Gas- serian ganglion in a case in which resection had never been performed, but the examination of the motor root, in a case

276 FOREIGN BODIES IN GULLET. sheath of the large vessels. Assistants separate the edges by thin and broad copper spatulae, and the cavity is frequently sponged. The larynx is pulled aside, and turned a little over on its axis ; the pha- rynx is thus exposed. During the latter part of the dissection, the laryngeal nerves and thyroid arteries must be looked for and avoided. The foreign body is felt through the parietes, and these are laid open to an extent sufficient for its extraction. It is ad- visable to nourish the patient for some days after- wards through an elastic tube passed by the mouth or nares into the gullet, with its extremity one or two inches beyond the wound. Its introduction re- quires caution ; an instance is on record of a tube being passed with the view of conveying nourish- ment, and the surgeon not discovering that its extre- mity had slipped into the larynx till after the injec- tion of some fluid. It is recommended to wait for some minutes before proceeding to inject, and that, if during that time no air pass through the tube, the instrument may be considered certainly in the oeso- phagus. It is seldom that the opening of the oeso- phagus will close by the first intention, and there- fore accurate approximation of the external wound need not be attempted. Re??ioval of noxious matter from the stomach is now successfully practised by the aid of instruments. This is required when the excitability of the organ has been impaired or destroyed, and emetics in con- sequence do not act. It is unnecessary here to treat of the emetics which

5 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. unwarrantable and unnecessary—unwarrantable, be- cause the cicatrized scarifications leave an unseemly and permanent mark on a prominent part of the countenance,—and unnecessary, since there can be no occasion for six or eight incisions when one is fully sufficient. The bleeding may be readily stop- ped, after the requisite quantity has flowed, by a small graduated compress placed over the wound, and retained by bandages, which surround the head, and are afterwards twisted and brought under the chin in order to increase the security. If by these means the bleeding is not readily restrained, the vessel may be divided throughout its whole circumference, by entering the lancet at the original wound, and moving its point laterally. Then compression is to be again employed, by the assistance of which the natural processes for closing the divided extremities are speedily accomplished. When this artery has been injured by external violence, the wound of the integuments is generally large, and the bleeding profuse. In such cases, both ends of the vessel must be pulled out by means of forceps, and tied separately ; afterwards the inte- guments are to be approximated and supported. Unpleasant consequences sometimes result from the simple operation of opening the temporal artery, and occasionally also from accidental wounds of that vessel. The integuments unite, and may soon heal, but, from the compression not being sufficient, a small quantity of blood is insinuated into the cellular tissue, which becomes condensed for a considerable

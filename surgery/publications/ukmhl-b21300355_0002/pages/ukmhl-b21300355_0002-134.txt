It is not an unfrequent consequence of internal ophthal- mia, and almost invariably follows the slightest wound, or most delicate puncture of the lens : it often occurs after slight injury of the lens or its cap- sule, inflicted during attempts to form an artificial pupil. Cataract may occur rapidly from extensive dilatation of the lenticular vessels ; or from such an injury of the eye as causes laceration of the vessels supplying the capsule and lens, detaches them from their other connexions, and consequently leaves them without a nutritive source. Cataract sometimes disappears spontaneously, be- ing absorbed; but most frequently an operation is required to remove the opaque body from the axis of vision, though no hurry is necessary in having recourse to it. The chance of success from opera- tion must depend very much on the state of the different parts of the eye, on the kind of cataract, and on the state of the constitution. Many reme- dies, external and internal, and mercury amongst the rest, have been employed with the view of dissipa- ting cataracts ; but all are of no use. An operation, of one kind or another, only can be relied on. And still, even in favourable cases, and in the best hands, the contingencies attending operation are so great, that success cannot be absolutely promised or expect- ed. The mode of operating, and the kind of opera- tion, must be varied according to circumstances ; and great experience is required to determine the proper <

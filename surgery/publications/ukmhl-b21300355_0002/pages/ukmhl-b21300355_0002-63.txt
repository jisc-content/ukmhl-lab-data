DISEASES OF THE SCALP. 53 the bone is found denuded. Exfoliation is then in- evitable. Exfoliation generally follows denudation of the bone by accident, but not uniformly. When the periosteum is stripped off by violent injury, the bone in some cases does not lose its natural colour ; granulations arise from the exposed part, and it again becomes covered without any part of its sub- stance having been destroyed. Again, careful removal of the periosteal covering, as in excising a tumour or ulcer by the knife, may be followed by death of the outer table of the scull; small portions only separating in some cases, whilst in others a large part of the bone perishes. The cranial bones may in part become dead throughout their entire thickness and separate, either after a severe bruise, or in consequence of in- flammatory action following injury or arising from disease. The process of separation is either speedy or tedious, according to the vigour of the constitution. The deficiency is repaired, in a great measure, from the subjacent bone, when its whole thickness is not thrown off. But when the breach is complete, the surrounding parts assume the reparative action : the granulations from the dura mater and integuments coalesce, and a dense membrane fills up the space. The denuded bone should be kept covered and moist, and for this purpose lint frequently wetted with tepid water is the best dressing: spirituous or greasy applications can do no good. A free dis- charge for the matter should be afforded, and the u ound kept clean. If the exfoliation goes on slowly.,

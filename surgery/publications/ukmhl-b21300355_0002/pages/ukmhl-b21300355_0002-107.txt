DISEASES OF THE EYE. 97 The edges are elevated, and the surface, which is of an ash colour, discharges an acrid colourless fluid, as in similar affections of all surfaces that are covered with a delicate, tense, and exquisitely sensible expansion. Sometimes the ulcer is very minute and superficial, and enlarges very slowly, if at all; but in other instances it extends rapidly in depth and size, with great pain and irritability of the organ, and intolerance of light; occasionally their increase is expedited by partial sloughing. At first, when the ulcer is minute, the part often retains its natural transparency. But as the disease advances, when the sore spreads superfi- cially either by the sloughing or the ulcerative pro- cess, or by both, the cornea becomes opaque, often to a considerable extent, around the ulcerated part; and if the ulcer extends deeply, so as to perforate the tunics, the aqueous humour escapes, the iris falls forward, and the pupil becomes distorted ; in either case vision is impaired or destroyed. In some cases great relief follows discharge of the humour, and the consequent 11 acridity of the cornea, the ulcers seem- ing to have been prolonged and irritated by the ful- ness of the chamber. Abrasion of the conjunctival covering of the cor- nea is produced by accident, or follows incited action of the vessels. The abraded surface either ulcerates, or contracts and heals kindly, with or without opa- city of the part. Breach of surface in the cornea,— whether an ulcer, an abrasion, or a raw surface caused by the giving way of a pustule, or of a small abscess, —is constantly liable to irritation, on account of not PART II.

308 WOUNDS OF PALMAR ARCHES. should be employed—the arm, hand, and fingers being previously bandaged, to prevent infiltration of the limb. Wounds of the radial and ulnar arteries may re- quire their being exposed and tied at various points and at various periods—shortly after the accident, or after the lapse of many weeks—on the occurrence of secondary bleedings, or after the formation of false aneurism. This is accomplished by incision in the course of the wounded vessel, sacrificing as few mus- cular fibres as possible. Nevertheless, the incision must always be free, to enable the surgeon to effect his purpose readily. Wounds of the Palmar Arches, and of the branches proceeding from them to the extremities of the me- tacarpal bones, are exceedingly common ; as also wounds of the radial artery betwixt the thumb and forefinger, of the arteria radialis indicis, and of the superior volar branch. The opening in the integu- ments and palmar aponeurosis is usually narrow, and the haemorrhage copious ; it is generally arrested by pressure. From these circumstances, blood is ex- travasated extensively into the deep cellular tissue, blood continuing to escape from the artery, and being either imperfectly discharged, or completely confined. Great swelling, with tension and acute tenderness, takes place ; in fact, rapid inflammatory action is kindled in the infiltrated parts, and unhealthy ab- scesses form ; the matter ultimately reaches the sur- face, but by that time ulceration or partial sloughing has taken place at the wounded part of the vessel.

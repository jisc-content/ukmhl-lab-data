ULCERS OF THE LIPS. 182 tion from various causes; from long continued irri- tations, as sharp corners of teeth, rugged tartar on the external surfaces of the teeth, the habitual use of a short tobacco pipe ; from external violence; from the application of acrid matter; or from an ulcerative disposition unconnected with external circumstances. The constant and free motion of the parts is preju- dicial to healing, and consequently the sores often remain long open. Though ulcers on the lips are generally of a bad character, it does not follow that all are so. Many are simple ; but these after re- maining long are apt to degenerate. Others from the first assume malignant action, and unfortunately they are more frequently met with than simple and well-disposed sores. The malignant sore often com- mences in a warty excrescence which ulcerates at the base; the ulceration extends, the warty appearance is succeeded by ragged and angry fleshy points, the surrounding parts become indurated and the stony hardness spreads. The appearance which the sore presents is that of open cancer, described at page 187, Part I. The ulceration may either be limited in depth and extent to a small part of the lip, or may involve the greater part of the prolabium, and that without much induration. It is generally situated on the right side of the lower lip ; sometimes in the angle of the mouth ; the upper lip is rarely affected. I have removed a few malignant ulcers from this last situation. Sooner or later the lymphatic glands par- ticipate in the disease ; a chord of indurated lym- phatic vessels is felt passing over the jaw in the course of the facial artery, and the glands with which

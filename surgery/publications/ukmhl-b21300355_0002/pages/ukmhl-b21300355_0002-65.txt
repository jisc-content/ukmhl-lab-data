DISEASES OE THE SCALP. 55 bone itself. It is by no means uncommon to find the cranium very extensively diseased, though the affection originated in the superimposed soft parts. Such ulceration of the bone is of a peculiarly de- structive nature ; it is a disease of the oseous tissue, corresponding to the most malignant ulceration of the soft parts. The bone around the ulcerated cavity is spongy and soft, its margin is irregular, and bristles with numerous spiculse ; the centre is composed of soft morbid deposit, entangling small portions of bone which have become detached, and flabby lifeless gra- nulations shoot from the distempered mass. Such disease, when the patient does not soon succumb to its virulence, advances to a frightful extent, affecting a large surface, destroying the whole thickness of the bone, and even exposing the internal parts. In a case of this description which lately occurred in the Royal Infirmary, the anterior half of the cranium was totally destroyed, the left orbit contained a putrid mass of the disorganized eye mixed with pus and bloody fluid; the dura mater was exposed, and sloughed at several points, and the unhealthy discharge from the parts lodged on the surface of the brain. In malignant disease of the scalp, as of other parts, the lymphatics become secondarily affected : the absorbents feel hard and thickened, the glands in the neighbourhood en- large and ulcerate, and the sore thereby formed soon assumes the characters of decided malignancy,â€”hard everted edges, an angry surface, and foetid thin dis- charge.

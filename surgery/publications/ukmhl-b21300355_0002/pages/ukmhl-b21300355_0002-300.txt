290 ABSCESS OF NECK. from each other, with unhealthy purulent matter in- terposedâ€”the trachea, the oesophagus, or the medias- tinum, opened into. Such cases have been alluded to at pages 41 and 45, Part I. The lymphatic glands situated amongst the fat and cellular tissue between the deep and superficial cervical fasciae immediately above the sternum, may become enlarged. When the tumour is large, breath- ing is impeded by compression of the parts beneath, and pain and much inconvenience is endured on account of its limited situation and resisting invest- ments. Purulent collections under the sternum are scarcely remediable. The parietes on one side are fixed, on the other have constant motion ; and thus the sur- faces, however healthy and well disposed, are pre- vented from coming together and adhering. The discharge continues, and at length wears out the patient, pulmonary affection perhaps supervening. The same unfavourable causes operate in other situa- tions, in the iliac fossa, and in chronic collections under the cranium. In abscess of the mediastinum, no dependent opening can be obtained, unless by per- foration of the sternum. This is perhaps warranted by cedematous swelling over some part of the bone, indicating, along with other symptoms, the existence of matter beneath. Purulent collections sometimes form in the substance of the sternum, communicate with the mediastinum, and involve the lower part of the neck. The thymus gland is said to be liable to chronic

116 DISEASES OE THE EYE. first, and of a brighter hue, it is obvious that they belong to the conjunctiva. They also approach the clear part of the eye ; and if numerous, obscure the former vessels—as also the red zone and white line— for they pass over them, and reach the corneal mar- gins, and often go beyond it, in continuous ramifica- tions. The sclerotic, in consequence, assumes a pink red colour, and the cornea becomes dim. The iris may be primarily and principally affected, and if so, the disease is termed Iritis ; but in most cases all the other internal parts suffer more or less. The iris changes its appearance, becomes of a dusky hue, either in part or throughout, and red vessels are distinctly seen in it; from grey or blue it changes to a greenish colour, and when formerly black or brown it becomes reddish. The size of the pupil diminishes, and the contraction is often irregular, when the inflammatory action is intense. The iris swells perceptibly, and the pupil loses its dark colour, or is almost entirely closed, either from effusion of lymph, or from inflammation and consequent opacity of the chrystalline lens and its capsule. The iris projects forwards, and diminishes the capacity of the anterior chamber; the pupil is irregular and often assumes an angular appearance ; and the irre- gularity becomes permanent from adhesion of the pupillary margin of the iris to the capsule of the lens, lymph being effused and organized, and forming a firm uniting medium between the parts. Occasionally adhesions form at the middle of the iris, and cause

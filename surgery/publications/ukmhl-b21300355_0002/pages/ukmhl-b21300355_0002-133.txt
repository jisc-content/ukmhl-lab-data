123 DISEASES OF THE EYE. opacity is observed, though the pupil be dilated ; and the motions of the iris are sometimes slow. The opaque spots are said to move when the position of the head is changed. The anterior portion of the capsule, the posterior, or the whole may be affected; but the anterior is the part which most commonly becomes opaque. In many cases, both lens and capsule are affected, and then the cataract is termed Capsido-lenticula?'. Most frequently the diseased lens, in such circum- stances, is of fluid consistence ; and in many cases is spotted. Portions of lymph, organized or not, lodged in the posterior chamber, have by some been termed Spu- rious or Adventitious cataract; since, when the pupil is shut by such effusion, the appearances presented are somewhat similar to those caused by opacity of the lens, or of its capsule. Such deposits, however, can readily be distinguished from true cataract, being in general of a yellowish colour, in close contact with the posterior surface of the iris, and, when organized, often streaked with red vessels. Frequently, too, the pupil is irregular from adhesions between the lymph and the pupillary margin of the iris. Cataract would, in some cases, appear to be here- ditary, and frequently it is a congenital affection. In very young children, it may be caused by imprudent exposure to strong light. In adults, it often seems to be produced by the action of strong, reflected light, as by exposure to intense fires in forges, glass- houses, &c. or by a dependent position of the head,

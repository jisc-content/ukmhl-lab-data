INFLAMMATION AND ABSCESS OF THE GUMS. 215 or extraction of the teeth, grows rapidly, and in- volves more and more of the gums and alveolar pro- cesses. Angry ulceration attacks the prominent parts of the swelling ; the bone is softened to a considerable extent around; the discharge is thin, bloody, and profuse. Ultimately the lymphatics be- come affected, neighbouring parts are contaminated, malignant action acquires a firm footing, and extends, the patient becomes hectic, and dies. Each kind of tumour should be removed freely and early ; the untoward results of the latter have been already mentioned ; and I believe, that if the former be allowed to progress unchecked, the tumour will extend to the bone, and osteosarcoma of the jaw, more or less extensive, be established. The disease must be attacked at an early period of its existence, and teeth, sockets, and soft parts taken freely away, by means of a strong knife. After excision, the actual cautery should be applied, otherwise the dis- ease is apt to recur. Portions of involved bone, which may have escaped the knife, are by the cau- tery made to exfoliate. Inflammation of the Gums and neighbouring parts is attended with violent pain, swelling and throb- bing, difficulty in opening the mouth, headach, and fever. Inflammation of the soft parts runs its course speedily, and, as the cause is seldom removed during the existence of the inflammatory action, generally terminates in suppuration, so giving rise to what is termed parulis or gumboil. Frequently the inflam- mation extends to the sockets of the teeth, which sel-

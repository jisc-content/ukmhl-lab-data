DISEASES OF THE EYE. 128 seldom admissible ; and if the eye be so unsteady or sunk as to require it, the surgeon ought not to at- tempt extraction. No one method can be exclusively followed ; by a man of judgment, experience, and. skill, the operation will be varied according to circum- stances. Operation with needles is termed couching; and the cataract may be either depressed or reclined. Depression is preferred, by many good authorities in surgery. The needle is introduced at a line—or a line and a half, so as to avoid the ciliary processes—from the junction of the cornea with the sclerotic, towards the external canthus, and below the transverse dia- meter of the eye ; and the opaque lens, if solid, is entangled with, the point of the instrument, and pushed into the lower part of the ball. Thus the opaque body is removed from the axis of vision, so as not to obstruct the passage of rays of light to the retina ; and, in successful cases, it is highty probable that the lens, after being detached and displaced, is altogether removed by the absorbents. Violent in- flammation occasionally takes place after the opera- tion, followed with destruction of the eye from sup- puration; or the iris becomes paralytic; or the pupil closes, and sight is gradually lost; or the cornea be- comes flaccid, with congestion of the vessels and tur- bidity of the humours. The needle should be of a conical form, thickest towards the handle, so as to prevent the humours from escaping during its intro- duction. It should also be straight, excepting a short curvature of its point, rather slim than other- 5

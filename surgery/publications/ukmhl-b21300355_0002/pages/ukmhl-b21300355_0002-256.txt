246 DISEASES OF WINDPIPE. vertently swallowing boiling water, and a portion of the hot fluid getting into the windpipe. It is sup- posed that certain slight degrees of this affection are to be ascribed to spasm, but this opinion has not been so sufficiently confirmed as to entitle spasm to be confidently stated a frequent cause of croup; in nervous and hysterical females, certainly, paroxysms of slight difficulty in breathing are not of unfrequent occurrence, and in them it may be ascribed, with much probability, to a spasmodic action. In children, dyspnoea, apparently dependent on spasm, is produced by affection of the base of the brain. The most desirable termination of the disease is of course resolutionâ€”the cough, pain, and uneasiness subsiding, and the constitution gradually attaining its former state of composure. Too frequently, how- ever, the inflammatory action proceeds unabated, and terminates in effusion of lymph, which is generally of great extent, adhering to the surface of the mucous lining, and forming what is termed a false or adven- titious tubular membrane. On the lymphatic forma- tion, dyspnoea is much aggravated ; and the second stage of the disease is then said to have commenced. Occasionally the patient sinks before effusion has taken place. The extent to which the pseudo-mem- branous deposit occurs is extremely various ; in some cases it is confined to the larynx, or to the upper part of it; in others it lines the whole of the windpipe, and often is prolonged, either in flakes or tubes, into the ramifications of the bronchi. In general, it is not at every point adherent to the mucous membrane,

179 ABSCESS OF THE ANTRUM. be traced to exposure to cold ; it may be the result of external violence ; but is usually an extension of disease in the sockets of decayed teeth. Unless active and early measures are taken to subdue the inflammatory attack, the antrum becomes distended by increased and vitiated discharge from its lining membrane. The swelling of the cheek becomes more apparent, since, to increased infiltration of the soft parts, enlargement of the cavity is superadded. The membrane covering the small aperture through which the antrum and nostril communicate, partakes of the general thickening, and thus no outlet is left for the accumulating fluid. The escape of matter from the nostril, on the head being turned to the opposite side, has been laid down as an indication of accumulation or abscess in the antrum ; the statement is incorrect, and is a result of surgery being professed by those who have not practised it, but judge of morbid states by the healthy condition of parts. In the skeleton, fluid no doubt will run over from the osseous shell, in some positions of the scull; but it cannot escape from the cavity when covered with membrane, and that membrane subject to vital actions. In short, the symptom is not observable in the disease in ques- tion. Extensive ulceration of the parietes of the antrum towards the nose may take place, as a con- sequence of the accumulation, and the matter may then escape by the nostril, if not allowed an exit otherwise ; but such is not a common occurrence. In general, the cavity is considerably enlarged be- fore the matter comes to the surface. If not inter- fered with, it usually escapes through the sockets of

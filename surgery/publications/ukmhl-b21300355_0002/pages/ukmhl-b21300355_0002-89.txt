79 DISEASES OF THE EYE. protruding the lid: or the lid may be relaxed, and the conjunctiva may swell in consequence of repeated inflammation of the parts, caused by frequent and careless exposure ; or the disease may be the result of contraction, by cicatrization, of the integuments of the face, as after burns* or extensive superficial wounds in the neighbourhood of the eye. The affec- tion may exist to a greater or less degree, being in some instances scarcely visible, and not troublesome, whilst in others, the eyelashes lie on the upper part of the cheek, and the swollen granulated conjunctiva is exposed. The lower lid is generally the one which is affected; the disease may exist in both eyes, or only in one. In strumuous habits both are frequently affected in a slight degree; and the upper lid, too, is sometimes turned a little outwards. When eversion is of long continuance, and complete or almost so, the conjunctival covering of the ball of the eye, and of the cornea, becomes dry and wrinkled; in short, the membrane completely changes its character, and becomes cuticular. In a lad who laboured eleven years under eversion of the upper and lower lids— arising from abscess and exfoliation of the external angular process of the os frontis, following a blow received when a boy—the conjunctiva was hard, wrinkled, scaly, and exactly similar to cuticle; and this change of the membrane also extended over the whole cornea. The surface of the eye had lost its lustre, and vision was much impaired, the patient being able to distinguish only very bright objects. By such cases, continuity of the conjunctiva with

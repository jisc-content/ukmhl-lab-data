303 IilGATUltE OF AXILLARY. those of arteries. The ligature has been passed round one of the cervical plexus, as happened in one of my own cases; the mistake was, however, not without its use, for on discovering that it was a'nerve, I re- tained the ligature, no knot having been cast, and by- it pulled the nerve out of the way, so as to allow of the artery being more readily secured. The artery is felt as it crosses over the first rib, and by pressure there, pulsation in the arm is stopt; sometimes it may be even seen. The knife, guided by the finger, is then used very cautiously to prepare the vessel for ligature. A blunt-pointed needle is passed, either plain or with a separable point, and the knots made as was formerly described. A piece of strong wire doubled, and either notched or perforated at the ex- tremities, affords assistance in securing the knots in so deep and contracted a space. Various kinds of serre-noeuds and needles have been recommended, but the simpler the instruments employed are, and the less a surgeon depends on them, the more likely is he to succeed in his undertaking. The axillary portion of the brachial artery cannot require to be tied for true aneurism. Were the aneurism seated at the border of the axilla, and the upper portion of the vessel beneath the clavicle free, the best, wisest, and safest proceeding, is to tie the subclavian. Then the shoulder not being raised, the vessel is not so deep as when the aneurism involves the axilla. The incisions are not so deep nor so ex- tensive, and do not involve so important neighbour-

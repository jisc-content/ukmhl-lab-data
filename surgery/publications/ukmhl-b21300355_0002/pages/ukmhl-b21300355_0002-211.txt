ULCERS OF PALATE. 201 by paring' off the prominent parts of the glands, no risk is incurred. Ulcers of the Palate, <%c, are said to have arisen almost uniformly from contamination of the system following sores on the genital organs. Now, at least, they seldom and scarcely ever occur from this cause, unless most execrable practice has been resorted to. Foul and extensive ulcers of the membrane of the mouth, of the tongue, of the gums, and of the folds of the palate, are common in those who have used mercury recently; and those whose constitutions have been saturated with mercury, or who have taken only alterative doses for a considerable time, are for long liable to ulcerations of these parts on exposure to moisture and coldâ€”one set of sores healing, but others soon breaking out. It is, indeed, very rare to meet with sores in these situations that are not thus accounted for: Certainly such as are by recurrence deep, extensive, and troublesome, are not seen unless in those who have suffered from mercurial medicines. Slight excoriations are not uncommon in individuals of the soundest and most untainted systems ; but even in very young subjects, if the sore is of consi- derable size, and slow in healing, it will generally be found that some preparation of mercury, probably calomel, had been given previously, and perhaps without precaution and care. Calomel, as well as other forms of the mineral, is too often and too freely given, and without proper consideration ; the ruin of many good constitutions is attributable to this cause,

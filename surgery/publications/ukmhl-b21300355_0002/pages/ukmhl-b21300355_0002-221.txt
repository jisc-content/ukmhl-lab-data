211 ItANULA. The operative procedure is simple and safe. The tongue is raised towards the palate, either by a spa- tula or split card—or, what is better, by the fingers —and the frcenum is cut across to a sufficient extent by blunt-pointed scissors. Hanula is a swelling produced by accumulation in, and distention of, the extremity of the combined ducts of the sublingual and submaxillary glands. The extremity of the duct contracts, or is completely closed, and in consequence the saliva and mucous (the one the secretion of the gland, the other of the duct) collect, distend the canal, and cause thickening of the parietes. Thereby a tumour is formed, which* in some instances, attains a very large size, displa- cing in some measure the neighbouring parts, and incommoding the tongue in particular. Indistinct utterance and impeded deglutition result. The orifice of the duct, if discovered, is to be dilated gradually by occasional introduction of va- riously sized probes. Often it is necessary to make a small incision in the situation of the orifice, and introduce a bit of gum-elastic bougie, by continuing the use of which for some time, permanency of the opening may be obtained. Deposition of earthy matter—principally phos- phate of lime—not unfrequently takes place in the extremity of the submaxillary and sublingual ducts, and the concretion so formed is often of considerable size ; some are larger than an almond. The colour is either white or yellowish, and the surface either

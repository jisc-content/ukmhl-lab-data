SCROFULOUS NECROSIS AND CARIES. 317 wards the best application to the ulcerated surface, as to other irritable sores, is the nitrate of silver, either used solid and followed by poultice, or em- ployed in the form of lotion. The remedy is almost specific ; very few cases prove obstinate under it. Sometimes it may be of advantage to alternate it with the black wash. In protracted and unyielding cases, removal of the whole matrix of the* nail has been proposed; the dissection is painful and tedious, and its efficacy doubtful. When the sore is of a weak character, discharging a glairy secretion, studded with soft flabby granulations, connected with un- soundness of the neighbouring cellular tissue, sur- rounded by undermined integument, and by consi- derable boggy, soft swelling, free application of the caustic potass is highly beneficial. When the bone is denuded, and involved in ulceration, the phalanx should be amputated. Unhealthy children are subject to disease of the phalanges, and of the metatarsal and metacarpal bones, excited by slight injury, or originating with- out apparent cause. Often more than one bone is affected. There is great swelling of the soft parts around the diseased bone, indolent, and not painful; at first hard and white, afterwards more yielding, and of a dark red hue at one or more points. Im- perfect suppuration takes place, the integuments ulcerate, and the cavity of the abscess leads to the . exposed bone; a portion of this generally dies, and is long of separating. Great addition of bony mat- ter is deposited around, in irregularly aggregated

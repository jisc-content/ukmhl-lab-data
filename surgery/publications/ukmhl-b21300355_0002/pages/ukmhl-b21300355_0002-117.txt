Leeches applied to the conjunctiva of the lower lid are sometimes advantageous ; but leech- ing and scarification are more useful in the chronic stage : and the latter is injurious in acute ophthal- mia. Saline purgatives, and antimonial medicines, a very material part of the antiphlogistic regimen, must not be omitted. Enemata, with occasional pedi- luvia, are much recommended by some continental writers. In bilious habits emetics, followed by mer- curial purges, will be found very useful. With re- spect to topical treatment, warm applications are found to afford decided relief in the first stage, and are in consequence generally used. By some, how- ever, cold water, or water with vinegar, is applied from the first. Poultices, whether warm or cold, prove annoying from their weight. Warm fomen- tations, simple or anodyne, are preferable, and may be repeated according to the feelings of the patient; or the eye may be exposed to the steam of water. When by these means the violence of the symptoms has abated, as usually happens in the course of a very few days, the organ must be gradually accustomed to its natural stimulus, light. The shade must be discontinued, and the room no longer darkened ; and now leeching and scarification of the conjunctival lining of the eyelids become of great service. The lid is everted in the way formerly described, and freely incised with a sharp lancet: and it ought not to be replaced immediately, lest the bleeding should thereby be impeded; but the incised surface must be left exposed for some time, and the blood taken

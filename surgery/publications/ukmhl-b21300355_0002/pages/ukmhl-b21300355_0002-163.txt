153 POLYPUS OF THE NOSL. Soft mucous Polypus may exist for many years, without depressing the palate, or projecting into the fauces. The anterior nasal cavity is its most frequent seat, and it widens and fills up the fissure between the anterior and posterior cavities ; frequently it pro- jects backwards, but is not visible, though it may be felt with the finger behind the soft palate. Its growth is slow. It may become malignant, as well as other adventitious structures equally simple ; but such an occurrence is extremely rare. It may exist for many years, and, when at length removed, will be found of simple structure ; and, if the operation be well con- ducted, no reproduction will take place. The tumours are supposed to be easily regenerated ; but the truth is, that they are seldom eradicated completely. In general some are left, and, leaving the narrow space or cells in which they were confined, soon become fully developed—they expand, and speedily take the place of those which were removed. They can never be got rid of at one sitting, the operation requires repetition once and again, and of this the patient should at the first be made aware. Malignant Polypi are met with in different degrees of advancement. Many are firm and fibrous, with an irregular surface and wide attachment—do not grow with great rapidity—furnish a sanious and bloody discharge, and give rise to painful feelings; if interfered with, their increase is accelerated. If removed completely, and escharotics afterwards ap- plied, reproduction may not take place. Tumours with broad bases, and of soft medullary 5

DISEASES OF THE EYE. 93 glued together. They often adhere so firmly as to require a very considerable force for their separation, and when opened, the matter gushes out as if from the cavity of an abscess. From confinement of the matter the inflammation is still more increased, and the cornea is involved. Whitish specks form on it, or it ulcerates, and the ulcers make their way into the anterior chamber of the eye; or portions of it slough, causing partial loss of the organ and openings into the chamber, in consequence of which the aqueous humour is discharged, and the cornea sinks and be- comes flaccid. In many instances the cornea becomes opaque, changed in texture, and increased in thick- ness, so as to form a convex projection from betwixt the eylids, termed Staphyloma; the sclerotic coat also is occasionally affected in a similar manner. A fre- quent cause of purulent ophthalmia in children is imprudent exposure of the eyes to strong light, the parent or nurse not remembering that the organ must be gradually accustomed to the stimulus. Exposure to cold may also induce the inflammatory action. The application of leucorrhoeal or gonorrhoeal matter to the eyes of the child, whilst passing through the vagina of the mother, is perhaps the most common cause of the disease.

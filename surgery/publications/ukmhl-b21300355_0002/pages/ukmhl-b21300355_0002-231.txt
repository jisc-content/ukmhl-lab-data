SPINA VENTOSA OF THE JAW. 221 charge ceased. Two years afterwards rapid swell- ing took place in the same situation, suppuration oc- curred, and the matter was discharged by incision ; the tumour subsided. Again inflammatory swelling occurred twelve months afterwards ; the same course was followed and the patient relieved. A hard swell- ing now occupies the jaw from its angle to the ca- nine tooth, it is increasing in size ; the necessity for its removal is apparent, and has been decided upon. But in general, after free evacuation of the puru- lent matter from a bony cavity, even of very large size, the space between the parietes diminishes rapid- ly, the distended and attenuated bone contracts and is condensed, the new deposition is absorbed, and the parts regain their natural and healthy appearance. In the slighter cases of spina ventosa, removal of the offending teeth or portions of teeth, is generally sufficient; the matter escapes freely enough from the sockets, and the discharge soon ceases. When the cavity is considerable and its parietes thin, a counter opening at the base of the jaw is required ; and it is often of advantage to introduce a small cord from the opening in the mouth through the counter opening, and to continue its use for a short time, drawing it backwards and forwards in the cavity occasionally. For making the counter opening and placing the seton at the same time, a strong needle in a fixed handle is most convenient. This practice I have employed in a good many instances, and can confidently recommend as successful. In a large

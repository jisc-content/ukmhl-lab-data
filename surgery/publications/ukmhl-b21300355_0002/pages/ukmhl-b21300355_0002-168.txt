158 DISEASE OF THE ANTRUM. those commonly employed. But it is questionable whether these applications have any effect in prevent- ing the future growth of the tumours. The malignant form of the disease, even in a very early stage, is unmanageable ; the tumours, if remo- ved, are speedily reproduced, and the fatal termina- tion may be accelerated by the interference. I have removed tumours from the antrum maxillare, and from the frontal sinus; but the parts became soon occupied by morbid growths of a more formidable character than the preceding ; the membrane and bone appear to assume a disposition to generate such, and the fungus protrusions cannot be kept down with eschoratics, nor with the actual cautery ; nor, after free removal with cutting instruments, have escharotics, however freely applied, any effect in pre- venting the inherent disposition to the disease, and preventing its recurrence. The antrum, when filled with such tumours, is easily laid open. The cheek is divided perpendicu- larly from over the inferior orbitary foramen to the mouth, and the soft parts are dissected from off the bone. The cavity may then be exposed by means of a small trephine : but this instrument is scarcely ever required, the parietes being so softened as to yield easily to the knife ; plyers or cutting forceps may be useful in enlarging the cavity. By the guid- ance of the finger, the attachments of the morbid growth are separated with a blunt-pointed bistoury ; and a scoop is used to turn out the diseased mass. The root of the tumour is then touched with a red-

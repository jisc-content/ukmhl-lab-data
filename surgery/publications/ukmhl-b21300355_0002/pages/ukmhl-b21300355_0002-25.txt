15 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. Treatment.â€”Whilst the circulation remains de- pressed after injuries of the head, or of other parts of the body, it is a common practice to abstract blood; but it is one which cannot be too much re- probated, for it is attended with great risk, and can be productive of no benefit; the feeble remains of vital power, whilst struggling as it were against the depressing cause, may by depletion be quickly an- nihilated, when the vigour which they still retained might have been sufficient, if encouraged and sup- ported, to overcome those effects of external injury which had so far reduced them. When a patient is seen insensible, it is highly pro- per and necessary to examine carefully the trunk, head, and limbs, in order to ascertain whether either fractures or displacements have occurred ; for it is by no means creditable to the care or science of a surgeon to be made aware of such accidents when the patient regains his senses, after the lapse per- haps of weeks, and when they can be remedied only with much difficulty. In the first stage of concussion, as was already ob- served, the circulation is much weakened, and it is therefore necessary to adopt means for sustaining and strengthening it; and with this view, warmth is to be applied to the surface, more especially to the ex- tremities and epigastrium, it being always weak in the latter situation, and mainly dependent on the gas- tric functions for its support. When the powers of life appear to be failing, sti- mulants must be administered internally. Perhaps

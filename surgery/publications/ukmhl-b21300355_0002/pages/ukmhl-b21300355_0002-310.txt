300 LIGATURE OF AltTERIA ANONYMA. excepting in the immediate neighbourhood of the ligature ; and the separation of this may be looked for from the tenth to the twentieth day. Then all risk of danger may be considered as past. Ligature of the Arteria Anomjma has been prac- tised successfully in very few cases. It is required for aneurism of the subclavian, or of the root of the carotid; or for large axillary aneurism, greatly raising the shoulder, and involving the parts at the root of the neck. The patient is either seated or semi-recumbent. An incision, from two inches and a half to three inches in extent, is made in the course of the carotid, termina- ting over the sterno-clavicular articulation. From that point, another is carried along the upper margin of the clavicle, to the extent of an inch and a half. The sternal attachment of the sterno-mastoid muscle is separated, the cervical fascia divided, and the vessel exposed. During the dissection, the internal jugular vein, the par vagum, and the recurrent branch, the inferior thyroid artery, and the arterial distributions from the thyroid axis, must be carefully avoided. The operator should, by free external incisions, make a dissection sufficiently spacious to admit of his see- ing the bottom of the wound distinctly as he proceeds. It is necessary that he not only feel but see what he is about to cut; groping is unsafe, to say the least. Caution in passing the needle is here required equally as in ligature of the carotid ; in such deep wounds the aneurism needle of Weiss is sometimes found useful,

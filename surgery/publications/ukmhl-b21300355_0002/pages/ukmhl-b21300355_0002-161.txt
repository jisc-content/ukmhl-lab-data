POLYPUS OF THE NOSE. 151 in one or both nostrils, growing from different parts of the schneiderian membrane. Sometimes there is but one tumour, of a large size ; and in some cases a large cyst, containing colourless fluid, fills the nos- tril. When numerous, they are in different stages of growth, and generally adhere to the membrane by a narrow neck, though sometimes several are attached by the same pedicle. It is not uncommon to remove ten or twelve polypi, or even a greater number, before the nostril is cleared. The parietes of the narrow passage betwixt the anterior and pos- terior nares is their most common situation, though their bases may proceed from the cells of the superior spongy bone. The membranous covering of the inferior spongy bone, or of the anterior cavity of the nostril, is often at the same time relaxed : indeed this of itself causes slight obstruction to the passage of air, and may be mistaken for polypus by the patient and the unex- perienced. Projection of the cartilaginous septum to one side, with thickening of its covering, may also give rise to the same mistake. This formation is not uncommon, but almost uniform, and the projection is generally to the left side, with corresponding depres- sion of the right; the circumstance may perhaps be accounted for by the pressure of the thumb over- balancing that of the fingers, in the habitual practice of clearing the emunctory. In polypus, the passage of air is obstructed, the patient feels as if labouring under a common coldâ€” his head is stuffed : in cold and dry weather air

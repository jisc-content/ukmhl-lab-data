31 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. numerable minute and sharp spicules. These sharp portions are driven down upon the dura mater, and by them the membrane is often severely lacerated. If these are not removed soon after the accident, inflam- matory action is almost invariably lighted up on the surface of the brain; and we cannot expect to allay or avert such action by general antiphlogistic means, however energetically applied, so long as their ex- citing cause remains. It is in such cases, I repeat, that the operation of trephine is imperiously called for. Sometimes, however, patients are found to recover from punctured fracture of the cranium, without the operation having been performed, as in the follow- ing case, the only one so terminating which I have met with :â€”On the 4th September, I visited a gentle- man, aged 35, who had received a punctured frac- ture of the cranium, on the 29th of August; a heavy fork had fallen from the top of a haystack, and struck him on the upper part of the head.

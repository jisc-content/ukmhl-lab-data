322 ENLAKGEMENT OF JBUJtSA OVER OLECRANON. able if long neglected. Congenital deficiency of the fingers is a deformity and inconvenience, but cannot be remedied. Adhesion of one or more of the fingers, even to their points, is met with occasionally as a congenital affection. Separation is readily accom- plished ; but the dressing requires to be carefully attended to. Adhesions may result from careless management of extensive abrasion or ulceration, or from a burn, and such are not so easily remediable. Superfluities may be abridged. Some children are born with two thumbs or two little fingers ; these have only a cutaneous attachment to the rest of the hand, and that is easily divided by knife or scissors. The redundancy shouM be removed by the obstetri- cal practitioner, as soon as it is observed. The Bursa over the Olecranon Process is liable to enlargement, by gradual accumulation of the secre- tion, in consequence of habitual pressure on the elbow. The contents are either serous or albuminous, usually the latter, and the swelling is indolent. But acute swelling not unfrequently takes place in this situa- tion, from external injury; then the tumour is formed rapidly, there is heat and pain in the part, and the in- teguments are discoloured around : in such cases the bursa is filled with pure blood, or with a sero-puru- lent and bloody fluid. Inflammation of the bursa often follows bruises and lacerated wounds, and is apt to extend to the forearm and arm ; causing extensive and deep effusion, great tension of the parts, and se- vere constitutional disturbance.

330 AFFECTIONS OF MAM MA, tumours have, from their great bulk, required extir- pation. Sarcomatous tumours of various kinds are met with, either in the cellular tissue under the mam- ma, or in the substance of the gland—tumours not of the gland, though in it. Such are generally traced to injury, as to a bruise by falling against the corner of a table or chair, an accidental push from the elbow of another, &c. Simple sarcoma is the most frequent formation ; but I have encountered tumours, thus situated, of a worse nature—reproduced, though freely and fully removed, in fact taken away along with the gland and neighbouring adipose substance. The gland itself is most frequently affected by car- cinoma. Sometimes it is attacked by, or involved in, medullary sarcoma; and bloody tumours are met with, as also the melanoid. In some cases, the gland is enlarged and softened, and penetrated by cysts of greater or less size, and more or less numerous, con- taining a fluid either serous, albuminous, bloody, or thin and black. The appearance and progress of carcinomatous, and other tumours, have been already described. The mamma is more frequently the seat of malig- nant disease than any other gland ; it is frequently excited, and much exposed to injury. Often the in- duration following abscess remains stationary for se- veral years, and at length takes on a new action, forms morbid deposit, and is of rapid growth. The disease seldom occurs in young subjects; though I have met with several well-marked cases under thirty.

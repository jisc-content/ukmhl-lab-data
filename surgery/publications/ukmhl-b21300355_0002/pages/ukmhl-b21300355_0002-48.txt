38 INJUltlES OF THE HEAD. young female fell from a great height amongst some rubbish, and sustained a severe blow on the left side of the os frontis, a considerable portion of which was thereby denuded. She seemed to be doing well for some time; but about the eighth day after the acci- dent, pain in the head, with vertigo, rigors, and sickness, febrile excitement, and a white and dry state of the bare portion of the bone, supervened. She was depleted copiously, but notwithstanding all the symptoms indicating formation of matter under the exposed bone were present, the operation of tre- phine was deemed inadvisable. Severe rigors conti- nued-; she became affected with spasmodic twitchings of the muscles of the face, and stiffness of the jaw, neck, back, and breast, and was, in short, allowed to die. On dissection, the dura mater below the dis- eased bone was found separated to a very considerable extent, and the cavity was filled with thin purulent matter : the abscess extended along the superior lon- gitudinal sinus, and communicated with this vessel through an ulcerated aperture ; the canal was filled with pus, as far as its junction with the transverse, near which point its cavity was obstructed, and the abscess limited by a firm plug of lymph. A small abscess had formed between the bone and peri- cranium, above the extensive collection within ; the internal table of the diseased bone was fractured and slightly depressed, and its fractured edge was rough, sharp, and projecting.

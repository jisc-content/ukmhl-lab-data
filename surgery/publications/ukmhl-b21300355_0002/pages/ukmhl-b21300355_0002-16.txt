6 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. extent around the wound, and ultimately a sac is formed, which communicates with the ununited open- ing in the artery, and is consequently filled with blood, coagula, and fibrin ; in short, an aneurismal tumour is formed. For the cure of this untoward occurrence, the artery may be tied between the head and tumour, as in the case of spontaneous aneurism ; but in consequence of the free inosculation which exists between the numerous ramifications of the artery, this measure may not prove successful, and it will be found necessary, either then or afterwards, to secure the vessel beyond the tumour. But there is another mode of procedure. From the tumour being generally small and circumscribed, excision of the whole of it can be effected easily, and so as to leave but a slight scar : this operation is not liable to failure, and is not more severe than the first men- tioned. After the removal of the diseased part by two elliptical incisions, both ends of the artery are to be included in separate ligatures, and the edges of the wound kept together. A more troublesome accident sometimes takes place,â€”ulceration of, and over, the vessel, with effu- sion of serous and purulent fluids into the surround- ing cellular tissue, often to a great extent. A pro- fuse flow of blood bursts from the ulcerated surface, perhaps twelve, fifteen, or twenty days after the vessel had been opened, and, if active means are not speedily adopted, the haemorrhage by its recurrence may prove very dangerous. In such cases compres- sion is of no avail; the bleeding may be staid for a

137 DISEASES OF THE EYE. anterior chamber be of its natural size, a small open- ing may be made in the cornea with a cataract knife, or a double-edged broad and thin one ; and through this opening small scissors may be introduced for division of the iris. II. Corectomia, or cutting out a portion of the iris, so as to make the opening oval, square, or angular. This is performed by introducing, through an aper- ture in the cornea, scissors, and forceps, or hooks double or singleâ€”the latter to lay hold of the iris, the former to divide it. After the escape of the aqueous humour, a portion of the iris may be made to protrude ; and on the projecting portion being cut off, the membrane with a proper opening in it re- gains its natural situation, in consequence of dis- charge of the humour from behind. This operation is applicable only in few cases ; the whole, or the greater part of the cornea must be clear, and the anterior chamber not diminished in size, so that sufficient room may be afforded for the introduction of instruments between the iris and the concave surface of the cornea. III. Corodialysis, or separation of the iris from its ciliary attachments, is the method most easily per- formed, and most generally applicable. The eye is fixed either with the fingers or with a speculum, and a curved needle, perhaps more curved than that usually employed for cataract, is introduced either behind or before the iris, and at the upper, outer, inner, or lower part of the ball, as circumstances may require. An artificial pupil at the lower part

V AFFECTIONS OF MAMMA. 331 Before that time of life, the tumour is generally of a strumous nature, and this should not be confounded with the malignant; for the one is remediable under the influence of constitutional means, the other is not. Malignant disease is in most cases developed about the period when the menstrual discharge ceases ; when the discharge is irregular previously to its en- tire cessation, the mamma is excited, and then hard- ness is perceptible. The disease also forms, though seldom, long after the " critical period," but in such cases its progress is usually slow. It occurs also, and not unfrequently, in those who have never had the mamma excited by lactation: and the mammilla is also subject to malignant disease in males advanced in life. When the malignant nature of the disease is re- cognised, the tumour should be extirpated without delay, before it has made much progress—before it has contracted extensive adhesions, or contaminated the lymphatics. The circumstances rendering inter- ference unadvisable have been fully spoken of when treating of tumours generally. If the patient is a female, the period of the menstrual discharge, if still regular, must be attended to, and avoided ; indeed this maxim should apply to every operation on the female. The most favourable time for operating is some days after the cessation. The position of the patient should be sitting, unless the dissection is ex- pected to be tedious ; but it ought not to be so,— the extirpation of glands, or the detachment of the tumour from parts to which it may have contracted

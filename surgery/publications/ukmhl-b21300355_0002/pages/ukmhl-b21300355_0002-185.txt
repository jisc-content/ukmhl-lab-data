175 ItHINOPLASTIC OPERATIONS. thread suffice to approximate and retain the surfaces. It is to be observed, that the flap is not twisted round as in the operation already detailed, but simply ele- vated, so as to do away with the risk of failure. Twisting is here unnecessary, for the mucous lining of the lip, forming the outer surface of the columna, readily assumes the colour and appearance of integu- ment, after exposure for some time, as is well known. The fixing of the columna being accomplished, the edges of the lip must be neatly brought together by the twisted suture. Two needles will be found suf- ficient, one being passed close to the edge of the lip ; and they should be introduced deeply through its substance ; two-thirds, at least, of its thickness must be superficial to them. Should troublesome bleed- ing take place from the coronary artery, a needle is to be passed so as to transfix its extremities. The whole cut surface is thus approximated; the vessels being compressed, bleeding is prevented ; and firm union of the whole wound is secured. The ligature of silk or linen, which is twisted round the needles, should be pretty thick and waxed ; and care must be taken that it is applied smoothly. After some turns are made round the lower needle, the ends should be secured by a double knot; a second thread is then to be used for the other needle, and also secured. With a view of compressing and coapta- ting the edges of the interposed part of the wound, the thread may be carried from one needle to the other, and twisted round them several times ; but in doing this, care must be taken not to pull them

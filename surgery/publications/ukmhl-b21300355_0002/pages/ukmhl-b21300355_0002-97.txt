DISEASES OF THE EYE. 87 norrhceal matter through carelessness. Occasion- ally metastasis of inflammation takes place from one eye to another; so that a person may be seen one day with severe inflammation of the right; and on the following day with a similar affection of the left, and the right entirely free from disease. Another cause, sometimes met with, of inflammatory action in' the conjunctiva, is the lodgement of large foreign bodies in the orbit, with or without destruction of the eye ; as splinters of wood, straws, rusty iron nails, sharp portions of stone, &c. penetrating the globe of the eye, or parts in the immediate neighbourhood. Upon removal of the cause, the redness, discharge of tears, pain, &c. sometimes subside without inflammation having been established, the vessels of the part re- gaining their contractility ; but if the cause is con- tinued for any considerable time, the effects do not rapidly abate. Wounds and other injuries of the organ are generally followed by inflammation. But a simple clean wound or puncture made with a fine instrument, as in many operations, and in a favour- able constitution, frequently produces little or no excitement of the part. The degree of excitement must of course depend upon the nature of the wound, the structure of the parts involved, the lodgement or not of the body by which the wound is inflicted, and many accidental circumstances. The eye may be in- jured by acids or by lime, and the textures acted upon chemically; again, the membrane may be wounded by pieces of hot metal, and then the destructive action is both chemical and mechanical; in both cases

332 AFFECTIONS OF MAMMA. firm adhesions, can alone cause delay, and when these circumstances exist interference is not allowable. Any warrantable operation on the mamma can be completed in a very few minutes. Two elliptical incisions are made from the border of the pectoral muscle, in the direction of the fibres, embracing the nipple and any portion of the integument which may be adherent or altered. The surgeon need never hesitate to sacrifice the nipple, for in this disease it can be of no further use ; besides, the malignant action is apt to return in it, when saved, it being almost always adherent to the tumour; it must be removed. The incisions are made quickly with either a scalpel or a sharp-pointed and broad bistoury ; the lower should be the first, that the flow of blood may not interfere with it and obscure its course. This is carried at once through the skin and subjacent adipose tissue, and then the upper is made rapidly, to get over the most painful part of the operation as soon as possible. The dissection is next proceeded in, from the axillary region forwards, and the tumour detached first on one side and then on the other. A few strokes of the knife will separate the remaining cellular attachments to the fascia of the muscle. The surface of the wound and of the extirpated mass should be examined, so that no part may remain whose structure is altered. The vessels are tied ; and after oozing has ceased, if sufficient integument has been saved, the edges of the wound are put to- gether and retained. The patient is placed in bed, witli the head raised and the arm slung.

DISEASES OF THE SCALP. 48 pathy and connexion which exists between the parts affected and those situated internally : frequently, at an early stage of the affection, delirium occurs, with violent fever. In slight cases, in which the external surface merely is affected, there is little swelling, and but little pain or fever. But when all the pericranial coverings are involved, the symptoms are uniformly severe. The swelling is high and puffy, and extends to the eyelids, to the face, and, in some cases, even to the neck : the constitutional symptoms run high, and there is considerable risk of the patient dying comatose. If he recover, and if the disease is little interfered with, but allowed to take its own course, much sero-purulent fluid is infiltrated into the cellu- lar tissue, which generally perishes by sloughing along with a greater or less portion of the tendinous expansion. Often a large abscess forms, separating perhaps one half of the scalp, and bulging over the ear. The constitutional treatment must vary according to the nature of the symptoms which present them- selves ; in some cases showing great vascular excite- ment, and in others bearing unequivocal evidence of general debility from the first. In slight cases of the local affection, it is sufficient to relieve the tension, and abstract blood and effused serum by means of a few punctures, and afterwards to use warm fomenta- tion. More violent cases require free incision in the direction of the occipito-frontalis muscle, and thus only can destruction of the parts be averted ; the incision must necessarily be deep, for the scalp is

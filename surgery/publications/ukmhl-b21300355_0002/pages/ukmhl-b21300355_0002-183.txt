In this way the risk of failure will be diminished, and the form of the lip materially improved. The columna might be provided at the same time with the other parts ; but it would be more advisable to delay this part of the operation till a few weeks after adhesion of the other flap has been perfected. Since writing the preceding observations, I have in several instances performed the operation according to the plan here proposed, and with the most perfect success. The form of the nasal flap was this. The projection A was made in order to be turned down, so as to form the tip of the nose ; as well as to constitute a convenient attachment for the columna, which was subsequently to be made. In separating the connexion with the forehead, a thin wedge-like portion is removed, and the raw sur- faces, after the cessation of bleeding, are laid in ap- position, and retained by gentle compression. But this should not be done till the new nose is consoli- dated and perfect. Restoration of the columna is an operation which, in this, and other civilized countries, must be more frequently required than the restoration of the whole

241 WOUNDS OF NECK. sive, portions of the ingesta are apt to interfere with the air-tube, particularly if the wound is high, and the epiglottis cut away or disfigured. In such cases, soups and other nutritious fluids are conveyed through an elastic tube, passed by the mouth over the root of the tongue to beyond the injured part, and introduced only when it becomes necessary to administer food ; or a small tube may be passed by the nostril, and retained. If the wound is very severe, and the necessity for thus conveying nourish- ment likely to continue long, the latter method is adopted ; it is more difficult in execution than the former, but when the instrument is once passed, no further trouble is given to either the patient or sur- geon. Small quantities of nourishment are to be given frequently, of such strength as the symptoms indicate; many patients have died from inattention on this score. Many have died suddenly and unexpectedly (though this should not be, if symptoms and circumstances were attended to) from he effects of apparently slight wounds ; whilst others have recovered, when recovery was unlooked for, after dreadful injuries, and these perhaps not treated in the most approved maimer. In illustration, I shall briefly detail, though it did not fall under my own observation, an inte- resting and remarkable case of recovery. A crimi- nal under confinement attempted suicide by trans- verse wound of the throat. The larynx was severed at the upper part of the cricoid cartilage, and the cut extremities had retracted at least three inches ; PAUT II. Q

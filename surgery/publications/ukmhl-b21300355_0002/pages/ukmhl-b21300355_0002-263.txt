253 DISEASES OF WINDPIPE. affected parts can be at no great distance from the incision, and the irritation of the tube will be a suf- ficient cause to excite inflammatory action in parts contiguous to the original disease, and already dispo- sed to assume a similar action ; thus the disease will be extended. I have performed tracheotomy on a very considerable number of patients afflicted with oedema glottidis, and I may say, with uniform suc- cess. The disease was speedily subdued, and in most of them there was no great difficulty- in closing the artificial aperture, and restoring natural respiration. The relief afforded by the operation is almost instan- taneous ; the performance of it, if skilful, is attended with no danger; and want of success will generally be found to proceed from its having been too long delayed. In consequence of laryngitis, or of long continued irritation in the neighbourhood, the mucous mem- brane becomes indurated, and subsequently ulcerates ; or ulceration may extend from the fauces. In some cases, the ulcers of the larynx are few, and of slight extent; in others, they are more numerous, and of considerable width and depth ; and in some there is extensive and uninterrupted destruction of the sur- face, surrounded by thickened and elevated mucous membrane. This disease is termed Phthisis Laryn- gea.

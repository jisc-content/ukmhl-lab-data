285 BKONCHOCELE. Sronchocele is not rare in some districts of Great Britain, but unattended with the same peculiarities of countenance and mind as in some other countries. The majority of those affected come from mountain- ous districts. The disease generally commences early in life, and females are more subject to it than males ; indeed almost all who present themselves are females. The tumours are of various sizes, involving either the whole gland, or only a part. One lobe is usually in a state of greater advancement than the other. The swelling is for the most part soft and yielding, the integuments are thin and movable, and large veins shine through them. It is unattended with pain, or any great inconvenience, though sometimes it equals in size the patient's head, or nearly so, and then it is troublesome from bulk alone. In general, there is little or no obstruction to deglutition or respiration, and the health is not impaired. The tumour is always of slow growth, at length becomes stationary, and the patient gets reconciled to the defor- mity. Its structure is that of the simplest form of tumour, and it is seldom that its action degenerates. Internal remedies have been prescribed, with the view of arresting the growth, and promoting absorp- tion of the enlarged thyroid—burnt sponge—muriate of lime—muriate of baryta, &c. The use of iodine, ex- ternally and internally, has in many cases been attend- ed with beneficial effects. Tumours have diminished, and even disappeared entirely, during the employment of this medicine; but in others, the diminution has been either trifling or none. The insertion of sejpns

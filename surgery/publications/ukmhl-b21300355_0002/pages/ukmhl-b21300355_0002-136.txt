DISEASES OF THE EYE. 126 a view of preventing the opposite eye from suffering by sympathy; while others consider it more safe to refrain from operating, lest violent inflammatory ac- tion should follow, and, by extending to the other eye, cause disease there. However, when the cataractous eye does not present such appearances as forbid ope- ration, I conceive it both prudent and safe to remove the obstruction to vision, provided after treatment is carefully attended to, and all untoward symptoms actively combated as soon as they appear. There is still a considerable difference of opinion on the sub- ject, but the patient, being anxious to get rid of an inconvenience and deformity, often decides for the surgeon. When both eyes are cataractous, a question arises as to operating on both eyes at once. From my own experience I should say, that both eyes ought not to be operated on at one time : if they are, there is great risk of violent inflammation being established, and of the operation failing to restore vision. Imme- diately after one eye has been operated on, the other becomes very unsteady, and is altogether in an unfa- vourable state for operation ; and if interfered with, the chance of a happy result is but slight. But by operating on each eye at different times, much less risk is incurred, and the chance of success is doubled. Cataract may be operated upon at all ages, excepting infancy and the period of dentition. In congenital cataract the eyes acquire an uncontrollable rolling motion, and if operation be delayed till the patient has attained a considerable age, such motion cannot be afterwards prevented. In such cases, therefore,

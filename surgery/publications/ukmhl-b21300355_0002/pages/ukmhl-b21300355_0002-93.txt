83 DISEASES OF THE EYE. Inversion of the lid, from contraction of a cica- trix in the conjunctiva, may be counteracted, by de- stroying with caustic, or removing with cutting in- struments, a portion of the outer integuments, cor- responding to the internal cicatrix. Forceps with broad points are used for taking up a fold of the skin, and an oval portion is then excised with a knife or scissors, cutting instruments being less painful and more precise than caustics ; of the latter, the sulphu- ric acid has been particularly recommended for this purpose. The contraction of the wound releases the cilia from the power of the internal cicatrix, and the parts are restored to their healthy state. » The term Pterygium is employed to denote a thickened and vascular state of part of the conjunc- tiva. The diseased portion is generally of a trian- gular form, commencing at the inner corner of the eye, extending towards the cornea, gradually di- minishing in breadth, and terminating in a sharp apex, either at the margin of the cornea, or some- where between its margin and centre. The thicken- ing is seldom great, but the vessels which traverse the thickened part are numerous, enlarged, and tor- tuous—are, in fact, varicose. The base of the ptery- gium is always on the circumference of the eye, generally at the inner corner, and its apex is seldom, if ever, situate beyond the centre of the cornea: fre- quently the sclerotic conjunctiva alone is affected. The motions of the eye are little disturbed by the disease, but vision is materially impaired when a con-

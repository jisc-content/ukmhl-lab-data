Blistering the nape of the neck proves high- ly beneficial, after the employment of the antiphlogis- tic measures; and in many cases, it is necessary to keep up discharge from the blistered surface for some time. On subsidence of the violent symptoms, the swelled conjunctiva is to be attacked with escharotics and stimulants, as the nitras argenti, sulphas cupri, or various collyria : then only can such applications be advantageous; at an earlier period they must do harm.

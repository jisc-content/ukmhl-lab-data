ACCIDENTS AT BEND OF ARM. 307 injected into the vein, producing a thrilling sensa- tion, but little or no tumour. The passage of the blood through the narrow aperture is also accompa- nied by a peculiar noise, closely resembling that caused by the motion of the fly-wheel in a musical box. This is termed aneurismal varix, and is not so rare as the preceding. In recent cases of false aneurism, the sac may be cut into, the vessel exposed, and tied above and be- low the opening. This is recommended from its being found that the tumour is sometimes slow of disappearing after ligature of the vessel at a distance above. But when the tumour is of considerable duration and size, and the surrounding parts sepa- rated and altered in structure, there is no doubt as to the propriety of tying the humeral near its middle â€”as also, in the case of spontaneous aneurism. The vessel is not deep, but much entangled with nerves and veins. A free incision is made over its course, dividing the skin, cellular tissue, and fascia; the sheath is opened, and a ligature passed round the exposed artery. But it must be recollected that high division of the humeral is not uncommon, and, be- fore casting the knots, pressure should be made on the vessel with the finger against the loop of the liga- ture, and the effects on the tumour watched ; if pul- sation cease, and the tumour become flaccid, the liga- ture should be secured ; but if no effect is produced on the swelling, high division is demonstrated, and the other branch must be looked for. Pulsation is certain to return in the tumour, after a few days, and if slow in again disappearing, gentle pressure

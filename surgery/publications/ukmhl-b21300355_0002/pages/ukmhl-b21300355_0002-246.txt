236 WOUNDS OF NECK. gullet: it is seldom lower. Such are truly horrible, the countenance is contorted, and of a frightful ex- pression, inspiration is difficult, hurried, and noisy, and at each expiration blood frothed with air is for- cibly ejected from the wound. I have seen wounds of the trachea, near the top of the sternum, but with- out extensive division of the lateral parts; large wounds, such as are usually made at the upper part of the neck, could not be inflicted here without divi- sion of the large vessels, and instant death. Some determined suicides reach the vessels even high in the neck, dividing every thing down to the verte- bras ; immediate dissolution takes place from loss of blood. But, in general, mere opening of the air pass- age is all that is aimed at, there being a vulgar no- tion that this is sufficient for the extinction of life. A considerable quantity of blood is lost, though the branches only of the external carotid are wounded, and the loss may prove fatal; but the haemorrhage generally ceases on syncope taking place ; and if the patient be then discovered, means should be immedi- ately adopted for permanently arresting it. Its re- currence may cause death, on the patient recovering from the first faint; or he may die some days after, from the effects of loss of blood. And haemorrhage, though to no very alarming extent, is always to be dreaded in those advanced in life ; though in most cases the fatal result is not attributable solely to the bleeding, but is expedited by other circumstances, as defective supply of proper nourishment, and an unfa- vourable state of the mind. s

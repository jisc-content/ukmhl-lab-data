VENESECTION. 327 pears gradually by absorption ; or the opening in the integuments may not close, and the coagulum be se- parated and discharged after some days. Inflammation and abscess round the opening some- times supervenes. It is treated by fomentation and poultice, and rest, and the matter must be evacuated by free incision. Inflammation of the surface, with diffuse infiltration into the cellular tissue, is also met with after venesection ; the treatment of such an af- fection is the same as when it occurs in other situa- tions and circumstances. The symptoms and consequences of inflammation of the vein have been already detailed. The affec- tion is attended with great pain, and with swelling from effusion into the cellular tissue around the course of the vessel; the integuments are inflamed and tense ? sero-purulent secretion soon takes place in the infil- trated cellular tissue, both deep and subcutaneous, followed by sloughing, and separation of the skin from its subjacent connexions ; even death of the muscular structure sometimes ensues—the pectoral muscles have been found black and soft. The local treatment must be active. Incisions are made early into tense parts, to prevent internal mischief; and if the vein in the neighbourhood of the wound be filled with pus, it should be laid open freely. The evacua- tion of the matter affords great relief; afterwards poultices are to be applied to the wounds, and the other parts should be assiduously fomented. The bowels are to be attended to, and the secretions pro- moted by mercurials with stimulants—as camphor 5 %

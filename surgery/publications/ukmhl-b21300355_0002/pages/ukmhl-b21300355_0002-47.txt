INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 37 seemed to rate the dexterity and science of a surgeon by the number of holes which he was able to bore in the scull of an unfortunate patient. It ought never to be performed, unless the necessity for, and the pro- priety of, the proceeding be clearly indicated. It used to be practised in a most unlimited manner for fis- sure : cracks were sought for with the greatest care, rules were propounded to enable the surgeon to dis- tinguish fissures from the cranial sutures, and from furrows made in the bone by periosteal vessels ; and the trepan was frequently applied over each part of the fissure, however extensive it might be, the only apparent end of the operation being to widen very materially the solution of continuity in the cranium. It was also resorted to in cases of compression, with the view of discovering the effused fluid, and remo- ving it; but, as was already stated, it is unwarrant- able in such cases ; and much more so in concussion, for which latter accident, however, it has been occa- sionally performed. I met with a case even late- ly, in which the patient was not much benefited by such active practice. 11 The operation is of itself attended with danger, and likely, under many cir- cumstances, to aggravate the patient's symptoms, and diminish his chance of recovery. The cranium must be perforated, however, when the existence and site of abscess under the bone is distinctly marked : and in such cases the practition- er is much to blame if he does not give his patient a chance of recovery by the operation : many are lost by its not being performed, and the following case is a striking example of such negligent practice.

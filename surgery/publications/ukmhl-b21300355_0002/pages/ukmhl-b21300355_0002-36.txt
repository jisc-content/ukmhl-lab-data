26 INJUlilES OF THE HEAD. brittle cranium, by cautiously preserving themselves from exposure to violence. Solutions of continuity in the cranium, caused by external force, are either attended with depression or not. Fissures, mere capillary rents in the bone, may take place at the part of the cranium which is struck, or on the side opposite to that to which the force is applied. They will be found either short and limited by sutures, or extending in different directions through several sutures, as from the vertex to the base of the scull, and terminating perhaps in the foramen magnum. Fissures in the upper part of the cranium are of themselves attended with com- paratively little danger ; they produce no claim to at- tention, and really require none. But the force which gave rise to the injury of the bone may have dis- turbed the internal parts; and though the patient may have recovered from the first shock and the immediate effects of the violence, severe and dan- gerous consequences often result, and at a late period from the infliction of the injury. Fractures of the base of the scull are the result of great force applied to the lateral parts of the head, to the vertex, or to the base itself through the spinal column. A blow inflicted by an obtuse body on the top of the head whilst it is at rest and fixed, has the effect—by producing expansion of the lateral parietes, and forcing the base dow n upon the upper part of the spinal column—of breaking up the connexions of the bones at the base, which is the weakest part of the cranium, and splintering them to a greater or

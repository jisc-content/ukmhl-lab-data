ULCERS OF PALATE. 202 and to this cause alone. How long mercurial poisons continue to exercise a prejudicial influence on the constitution, is a question not easily determined. In many, its dominion is long and powerful. Frequently its effects are developed years after its exhibition,from accidental circumstances, such as change in the mode of living, derangement of the stomach and its ap- pendages, exposure to inclement weather, change of climate, &c. Sores form in various situations, between the pillars of the fauces—in the site of the tonsils—on the uvula, and by its side—on the posterior and an- terior surfaces of the pendulous velum ; sometimes the ulceration appears to have extended from the nostrils. Often the uvula is entirely lost; it is not long since I saw two uvulae, in one day, as black as a bit of coal, surrounded by ulceration, and just about to drop away. Ulceration of the posterior surface of the velum is marked by dark redness, and swelling of the anterior. Sometimes it happens, that by deepening of the ulcers, the velum is per- forated at one or more points, and the edge of the opening healing, a permanent deficiency remains. The whole of the soft palate may be destroyed, either by one extending ulceration, or by repeated attacks. When cicatrization takes place, the posterior nares are narrowed, deformed, or even completely closed.

DISEASES OF THE EYE. 141 Organic amaurosis (that depending on organic disease) may arise from the change of structure con- sequent on inflammatory action in the retina, whe- ther chronic or acute—from atrophy of that mem- brane and of the optic nerve—from extravasation into the substance of the nerve, or compression of it by morbid formations—from softening or suppuration of the nerve and its connexions—or from various dis- eases of the encephalon. Functional amaurosis may proceed from temporary plethora about the optic nerve and retina—from intense and long continued use of the organ—from derangement of the digestive appa- ratus—from general debility, however induced—from excessive influence on the system of poisons or power- ful medicines—from concussion of the nervous and cerebral substance, or from long continued irritation in the neighbourhood of the eye. Amaurosis may also follow injuries of various kinds. In the treatment of organic amaurosis but little can be done, and that little is unsatisfactory. In the functional form, however, vision may be impro- ved, if not wholly restored, by removal of the excit- ing cause, and the carefully avoiding of such circum- stances as seem to predispose to the affection. After due constitutional treatment, considerable benefit is often derived from counter irritation ; and I have in many cases witnessed the good effects of blistering the temples and besprinkling the raw surface with the powder of strychnine,—a practice very far from nugatory. On removing the blister, the cuticle and lymphatic effusion beneath are carefully scraped away,

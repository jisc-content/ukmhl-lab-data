TRACHEOTOMY. 260 When a foreign body has lodged in the windpipe, tracheotomy should be had recourse to without delay. In general, the offending substance presents itself im- mediately after the division of the trachea, and is ex- pelled by a strong current of air. But in some cases it may be necessary to introduce instruments—probes, scoops, or small forceps—upwards or downwards, to dislodge and extract the body. A little blood from the wound may cause coughing for some minutes, but this soon ceases ; the wound is closed, respira- tion is completely re-established, and all that the surgeon has then to combat are the evil effects on the mucous membrane which the contact of a foreign body may have occasioned. Tracheotomy is, in all cases, preferable to laryngo- tomy. In disease of the windpipe, as formerly stated, it is better to cut into a sound part of the passage, or at least as far as possible from the seat of the disease. When an adult, for example, labours under acute laryngitis, the effused lymph is generally con- fined to the larynx, as was already mentioned ; an opening below the thyroid gland is removed from the effusion, and by means of it the patient breathes through a tube yet sound ; whereas if the opening is made in the crico-thyroid membrane, the surgeon cuts into the middle of the diseased part: little or no benefit follows, and if the danger is not increased, that equivocal good is all that can be expected from such an operation. Tracheotomy is also preferable for the removal of foreign bodies, unless it is certain that the body is impacted in the rima, for in such

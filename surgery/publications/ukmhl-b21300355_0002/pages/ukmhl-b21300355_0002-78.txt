DISEASES OE THE EYE. 68 at least inclining towards that diathesis. Then the digestive organs must if possible be brought into a vigorous state, by tonics and nourishing regimen. The local treatment chiefly consists in applying stimulants to the internal surfaces of the palpebra and lachrymal sac. For this purpose, solutions of stimulating and astringent substances, termed col- lyria, and various ointments, are employed. At first they ought to be used of rather a mild nature, and their stimulating power must be afterwards increased gradually. The applications are placed between the eyelids, and becoming mixed with the natural secretion, pervade the diseased surfaces ; and being taken up by the puncta lachrymalia, are after- wards conveyed into the sac. It was formerly the custom to inject the fluids into the sac ; but this is unnecessary so long as the puncta and canaliculi remain pervious, and the permeability of these can be readily ascertained by means of a small probe. Per- manent pressure on the sac can be productive of no good effect, and is extremely liable to do harm. Introducing minute gold probes through the puncta has been much recommended, but in the generality of cases can be of little service. The probes are too limber for removing mechanical obstruction from thickened and hardened mucus, or for affecting in any way the contracted or strictured duct. But pass- ing of the probe may tend to remove the irritability of the passage, as in the urethra, and thence some relief may follow. Much dexterity is required in using either the probe or syringe. The puncta are a

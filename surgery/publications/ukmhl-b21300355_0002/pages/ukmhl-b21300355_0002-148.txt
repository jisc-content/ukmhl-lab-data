The point of the needle is entangled in the attached margin of the iris, and by raising the hand, quickly and partially withdraw- ing the instrument, the connexions are separated to a sufficient extent. Effusion of blood into the cham- ber, and to considerable extent, follows these pro- ceedings, and it is only after its absorption that it can be ascertained whether benefit is likely to result or not.

It is questionable whether bel- ladonna can be useful in preventing closure of an artificial pupil.

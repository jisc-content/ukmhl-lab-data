"WOUNDS OF NECK. 234 From constant external pressure, tumours grow- ing rapidly spread amongst the deep parts, and often form firm attachments. The parotid is displaced, and almost entirely absorbed, by the pressure of tumours growing out of the lymphatic glands which are lodged on its anterior surface. Such tumours attain a large size, and occupy the exact situation of the parotid ; and on their removal, the space betwixt the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process is completely ex- posed, and the styloid and pterygoid processes can be distinctly felt. From these circumstances many have been led to believe that they have dissected out the parotid ; but this and the other salivary glands seldom if ever degenerate. And if it do become the seat of carcinoma or medullary sarcoma, it is impos- sible to remove it with either safety or advantage. Even in the healthy state, removal of the parotid is a troublesome dissection ; and the difficulty must be greatly increased when enlargement has taken place from disease, when neighbouring parts are invol- ved, when firm and deep connexions have been form- ed, and important structures encroached upon. I have taken away many tumours from the site of the parotid, and some of large size, but would scarcely attempt removal of the diseased gland itself. The incisions, for the removal of the tumours of which we have been speaking, are to be made in the direction of the fibres of those muscles which are in- terposed betwixt them and the integuments, in the direction of the blood-vessels and nerves, and towards those points where the vessels are expected to enter

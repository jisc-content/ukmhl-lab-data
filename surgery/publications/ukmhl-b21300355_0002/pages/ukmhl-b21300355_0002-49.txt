39 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. well as its membranes, or the patient may not recover from the irritation caused by the abscess, and the depressing tendency of the antiphlogistic treatment which had been put in force previously to the forma- tion of matter. But still there is a probable chance, after the collected matter has been evacuated by the operation, of the dura mater granulating, the cavity filling up, the membrane becoming adherent to the cranium around the aperture, and the patient regain- ing his former health and vigour. If, after removing a portion of bone on account of symptoms of suppuration in that situation, the dura mater be found adherent, and of a healthy appear- ance, the surgeon is scarcely justified in going deeper in search of effused fluid: the evils liable to result from wounds of the dura mater have been already mentioned, and illustrated by an example. The operation of trephine must also be resorted to in cases of punctured fracture. One perforation will generally be sufficient to enable the surgeon to remove the detached fragments of the inner table. In fractures with depression, when the brain is oppressed and its functions suspended, means must be taken to elevate the displaced portion or portions to their natural level, and so remove the pressure. For the accomplishment of this purpose, it may or may not be necessary to divide the integuments. If they are entire, which is rarely the case, a crucial incision must be made, or one in the form of the let- ter T, and the flaps raised so as to show the extent of depression. No portion of the integuments ought to be cut away ; the preparatory process of scalping,

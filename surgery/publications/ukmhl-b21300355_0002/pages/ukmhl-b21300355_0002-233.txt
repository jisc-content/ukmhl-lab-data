OSTEOSARCOMA OF THE JAW. 223 The soft parts united kindly, and the patient obtain- ed a rapid, perfect, and permanent cure, returning home with the cheek united in ten days after the operation.

The ori- gin may be traced to external injury of the part; or the disease may take place in the jaw, either along with osteosarcomatous tumours of other bones, or subsequently to their developement; in such circum- stances a peculiar disposition of the system is the only cause that can be assigned. The tumour gene- rally occupies the lateral parts of the bone. Its growth may be either slow or rapid, and is attended with dull uneasiness, rather than acute pain. At first the morbid deposit is confined to the cancellated tex- ture, but as it increases the external laminae are dis- tended, and at last give way at one or more points, and the tumour protrudes fungus into the mouth. The consistence of the mass is various, it may be soft and brainy, or cartilaginous, mixed with bone and fibrous matter in various proportions ; but the anatomical characters have been detailed at page 207, Part I., and need not be here repeated. The features are much deformed, the swelling seriously incommodes the neighbouring parts ; the teeth loosen and drop away, and fungi arise from the sockets ; a foetid, thin, sometimes bloody discharge is secreted copiously, and the health declines.

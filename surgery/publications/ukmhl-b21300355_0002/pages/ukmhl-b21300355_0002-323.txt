PARONYCHIA. 313 same time administered, as required. The collec- tions which form are evacuated by simple division of the cuticle, and this, when hard, should be clipped away ; poultices are used for a short time, and then the raw surface is dressed, and the finger bandaged, daily. The hand should be kept constantly elevated. The swelling is soon reduced, the cuticle is regene- rated, and free motion of the finger returns gradually. In more severe cases, fomentation and copious ab- straction of blood , by leeching, at a very early stage, may effectually suppress the inflammatory action ; but patients seldom apply till after the opportunity for this treatment has passed. When tension has oc- curred, whether purulent matter has formed or not, a deep and free longitudinal incision must be made, including the affected tissues. This is uniformly fol- lowed by great relief, all the violent symptoms sub- side, and the action is limited ; the effusion, if any, escapes, and the affected blood-vessels are emptiedâ€” further suppuration is prevented, and the tissues are saved from destruction. Fomentation and poultice are used till the swelling begins to disappear, and the discharge to diminish; and the hardened cuticle is removed, when detached. The cure is completed by bandaging, and such applications to the wound as its appearance may render suitable. Should inflam- mation recommence and extend, or abscess threaten in other parts, recourse must again be had to free incision, followed by the treatment already described. Destruction of the articulating apparatus, with ulceration of the. opposed surfaces of the bones, is indicated by indolent swelling around, by unhealthy

DISEASES OF THE EYE. 131 surgeon must rest satisfied with exposing a part or the whole of it to the action of aqueous humour. The above operations may be had recourse to when —from diminution of the anterior chamber, adhesions of the iris, a morbid state of the pupil, and the tem- per of the patient—extraction cannot be attempted. When the cataract is small, it is immaterial how it is displaced; when large and solid, reclination is to be preferred. The operator is obliged to decide as to the mode of finishing the operation, after he has intro- duced the needle, and thereby ascertained the con- sistence of the cataract. If it is so soft as to permit the needle to move in all directions, it is impossible to displace it; it must be broken up and left in situ. In the mode of operation termed keratonyxis, the needle is introduced through the cornea, about two or three lines from its margin, and the cataract is either depressed, or broken up for solution. The pupil is previously dilated by belladonna, and the dilatation should be continued for some time after- wards. The puncture may be made at any part of the corneal circumference ; it soon heals, and leaves no scar. The operation can be performed without much disturbance of the organ, and is applicable when the cataract is fluid, or its consistence doubtful. Extraction, in favourable circumstances, and in dexterous hands, is a beautiful operation, and most satisfactory ; but ought not to be undertaken unless the surgeon has perfect confidence in himself. It can be resorted to only in adults, great steadiness on the part of the patient being absolutely necessary. The

FOREIGN BODIES IN GUI-LET. 273 hook attached to a whalebone probe—and long- curved forceps, constitute the whole useful apparatus. The feeling's of the patient are generally sufficient to mark the position which the body occupies ; he is made to throw the parts into action, by attempts to swallow the saliva, and during the attempt to point to the seat of pain. But by this both patient and surgeon may be deceived, for pain and a feeling of foreign matter being lodged often remain at a fixed point, after the body has passed down ; similar decep- tion occurs in other situations, as in regard to extra- neous substances in the eye, urethra, &c. Small and sharp substances seldom remain long in the oesophagus, but readily descend into the stomach and intestines ; they then either escape along with the faeces, or, as more frequently happens, penetrate the parietes of the alimentary canal. On leaving the stomach or the intestines, by gradual perforation, they frequently travel great distances in the trunk or limbs, without causing much inconvenience,—effusion of lymph surrounding them, and filling up their track. They will appear, long after their insertion, at a far distant point, approach the surface, and gradually make their way through the integument, or be readily extracted. When they enter from the surface, also, they often come within reach long afterwards, and far from their point of entrance. Needles, thus travelling, become oxidized. They are easily re- moved, on coming near the surface, by fixing them with the fingers, and making a small incision over the more superficial extremity. A needle may some- part it. s

284 AFFECTIONS OF EAlt. trocar, such as is used for hydrocele. The cauula is passed down to the membrane, and placed on one side of its centre lest the long head of the malleus should be interfered with. The trocar is then push- ed on gently, and should penetrate but a very short distance, in case of injuring the important parts at the bottom of the cavity. By some a sharp-pointed probe is used, passed through a quill; or an instru- ment about the same size with the probe is made for the purpose, with a canula to fit. But these are by much too small; even the puncture with a trocar closes, notwithstanding the application of nitrate of silver. I have lately used a sort of punch, such as is employed for making holes in leather, of a pretty large size, and neatly made, with the edge very keen, and on a small stalk. This is introduced, and when ob- structed, an attempt is made, with a rapid turn of the hand, to cut out a portion of the membrane. I have thus succeeded in improving immensely the hearing of one gentleman, enabling him to hear at four or five times the distance he could formerly. He had re- peatedly submitted to punctures before I saw him ; and, previously to the operation with the punch, I passed through the membrane a trocar, made large and well pointed for the purpose ; but notwithstand- ing this, and the application of the nitrate of silver, I was unable to preserve the advantage gained, longer than a very few days. In suitable cases, the opera- tion is worthy of trial, being unattended with pain or any dangerous consequences.

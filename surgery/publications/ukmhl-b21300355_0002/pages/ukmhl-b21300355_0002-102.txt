92 DISEASES OF THE EYE. is very apt to recur when they are crowded together in unhealthy situations. A disease of equal malignity, and resembling in all respects the Egyptian ophthalmia, occurs from the application of gonorrheal matter to the con- junctiva, or on sudden suppression of the gonor- rheal discharge, metastasis of the action then taking place from the urethral membrane to the conjunctiva: the eye is seldom saved from the destructive effects of the violent inflammation which follows the contact of the morbid fluid. Children are not unfrequently the victims of puru- lent ophthalmiaâ€”the ophthalmia neonatorum. Im- mediately after birth the conjunctival lining of the eyelids seems unusually red and turgid, and a great degree of swelling soon takes place, so as to render separation of the eyelids very difficult. Occasionally eversion of the lids occurs, when the child cries, from sudden and forcible contraction of the strong external fibres of the orbicular muscle. In general, the lids soon relapse into their former situation, but some- times the eversion remains if the internally project- ing tumour of the conjunctiva is allowed to become still more swelled from strangulation, caused by the outer margin of the reflected lid. The inflammation spreads over the ball; and in general, the swelling of the conjunctiva, being greatest at the circumference of the eye, bulges out the eyelids, and turns in'their margins. Pnriform matter is secreted copiously, and is confined, more especially when, from inatten- tion, the margins of the lids are allowed to become

262 TRACHEOTOMY. sometimes cross the line of incision, and it may hap- pen that some of the larger arteries of the neck, by following an unusual course, become liable to injury, if the operation were rashly performed. The plexus of veins on the forepart of the neck are pushed downwards, and the isthmus of the thyroid gland, if it exist, is displaced slightly upwards ; thus the rings of the trachea are cleared. The patient is desired to swallow his saliva, in order to elongate and stretch the windpipe; and the surgeon, seizing the favour- able opportunity, pushes the point of the knife, with its back towards the top of the sternum, into the tube at the lower part of the incision. The instru- ment is carried steadily upwards, so as to divide three or four rings. If the operation has been undertaken for the re- moval of a foreign body, its object is usually accom- plished immediately on division of the rings ; if not, the substance must be dislodged by proper instru- ments, as was previously remarked. The opening is allowed to close after the oozing of blood has en- tirely ceased ; but its edges must be kept asunder till then, lest the blood be drawn into the bronchial tubes, which occurrence, however slowly it take place, is always dangerous. The union and cicatrization of such longitudinal wounds are soon accomplished; they close permanently in a few days, even after having been open for many weeks with a foreign substance interposed between their edges. The same obstacles do not interfere as in transverse wounds : on the con- trary, every circumstance is in favour of rapid union.

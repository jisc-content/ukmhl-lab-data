30 * INJURIES OF THE HEAD. of the operation of trephine. In other words, it is said that simple fractures should be left to nature, unless under very urgent and alarming circumstances, and that compound ones ought almost always to be interfered with. But the facts are otherwise. The greatest danger of compound fractures of the cra- nium does not arise from the admission of air. It is not the wound of the scalp, but the mechanical irritation of the brain and its membranes that proves dangerous. Injuries of the cranium inflicted by sharp bodies, such as divide the scalp and cause compound fractures, are generally attended with splintering of the internal table, and require the trephine. The existence of this sort of fracture of itself, without a single bad symptom, without any present disturb- ance of the sensorial functions, is a sufficient war- rant for the application of the trephine, so as to per- mit the removal of the detached portions of the inner table: and this should be done before inflammatory symptoms have shown themselves. .The brittleness of the internal layer of the scull is well known. In fractures inflicted with sharp and pointed instru- ments, as a bayonet or pike, the corner of a sharp stone, or the heel of a horse's shoe, the external opening is often very small, it is a mere puncture; in the bone there is a central depression, from which fissures proceed around in a radiated form, and hence the accident has been termed punctured, or starlike fracture. But though the external wound is apparently insignificant, the vitreous table is ex- tensively separated, and, perhaps, broken into in- t

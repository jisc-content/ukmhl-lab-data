Constitutional disturbance always accom- panies the affection, and exists in a greater or less degree according to the extent of the disease. The iris may be primarily affected, but the other textures, both external and more deeply seated, too often be- come involved; and in aggravated cases the whole eyeball suffers. When the most internal parts, as the choroid coat, the retina, and the vitreous humour, are affected, sudden and bright flashes of light dis- turb the patient, whilst vision is rapidly lost, and for ever.

In Rheumatic ophthalmia, the appearances of the diseased eye are similar to those in ophthalmia pro- duced by any other cause. But the affection is accom- panied with, and seems to arise from, rheumatic dia- thesis.

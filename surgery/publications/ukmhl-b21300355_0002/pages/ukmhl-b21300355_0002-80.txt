DISEASES OF THE EYE. 70 narrow bistoury is to be entered into the sac, and carried on into the nasal duct, the knife being pushed downwards, backwards, and a little inwards, in the direction of that passage. The point to be punctu- red can always be readily ascertained by feeling for the firm ligamentwhich attaches the orbicularis palpe- brarum to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, as the upper orifice of the ductus ad narem is situate immediately below this tendon ; by introdu- cing the knife below the ligament, and within the sharp edge of the orbit, and then carrying it forward in the direction already mentioned, the surgeon can- not fail to enter the nasal duct. The knife should be followed by a probe, and ought not to be entirely withdrawn till the probe is fairly lodged in the duct, otherwise the surgeon will experience much diffi- culty in the after proceedings. If the knife be not pushed into the duct, a blunt instrument can scarcely be introduced afterwards. Some force is required, but is not hurtful, provided it be made in the proper direction, so as to remove the obstruction in the duct without injuring the bones and other parts in the neighbourhood. After the operation, some drops of blood should escape from the corresponding nos- tril, showing that all is right in the passage ; or the patient being made to expire forcibly, the nostrils being at the same time compressed with the fingers, air, blood, and mucus are forced through the opening made. Many and various modes have been pursued witli a view of securing a pervious state of the nasal duct.

193 CONGENITAL DEFICIENCIES. so as not to interfere with the operator. The head is thrown back, and held steadily by an assistant. The operator depresses the tongue by the forefinger of the left hand. A long, narrow, sharp-pointed bistoury, is passed through the velum, close to its attachment with the palatine plate, and about a six- teenth part of an inch from the edge of the fissure : It is then carried downwards to the point of the uvula, so as to detach a narrow slip from the whole edge. The same is done on the opposite side of the fissure. After allowing the patient a short rest, the coagula and mucous are cleaned away from the parts, to prepare for union. Long needles, in fixed handles, and armed, are passed through the pared edges on each side. On one side the ligature is thin, the op- posite thick and strong ; the former is attached to the loop of the latter, and withdrawn, leaving the strong ligature passed through both apertures ; and by this the margins are gradually approximated, and retained by a firm knot. A second point of suture, and a third, if necessary, is applied in the same way. Or a single short curved needle may be used. It is introduced by means of a portaiguille, with a long handle, and passed through, first from the outside of one edge, and then from the inside of the other. A ligature, either of thread or of pewter wire, qan thus be conveyed at once ; if the latter is employed, it is secured by twisting, and the ends cut off by pliers; the needle is attached to the wire by a female screw in its end.

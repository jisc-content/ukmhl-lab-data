In hospital practice, the infected should be se- parated from the healthy; and promiscuous use of towels and sponges must not be allowed.

After the discharge is esta- blished, the surface of the eye must be kept free of matter, by frequent injection of a bland, tepid fluid; and stimulating collyria should be applied three or four times a-day.

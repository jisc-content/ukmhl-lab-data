267 STRICTURE OF GULLET. swallowing- of soap lees, a fluid highly acrid, occasion- ing a severe degree of inflammation, and even de- stroying a portion of the parietes. Deglutition is difficult and painful; an exquisite degree of pain is occasioned by pressure on the sides of the neck, and the circulation is more or less excited. Redness and swelling of a portion of the mucous membrane can be observed on looking into the mouth. The changes which occur in the membrane, are similar to those produced in the windpipe by in- flammation. Resolution will generally be effected by the appli- cation of leeches to the neck, the exhibition of pur- gatives and diaphoretics, and strict observance of the antiphlogistic regimen. If the inflammation does not soon subside, it some- times happens that constriction of the passage occurs, either from thickening or oedematous swelling of a portion of the mucous membrane, or from effusion of lymph, and adhesion of the opposed surfaces. The common seat of stricture is that portion of the canal which is naturally the narrowest, the lower part of the pharynx and commencement of the oesophagus, immediately behind the cricoid cartilage: occasion- ally it takes place in other parts of the canal. In general, the contraction is of small extent, and unac- companied with much thickening around. The tube immediately above the constricted point is more or less dilated, and often to so enormous a size as almost to resemble a first stomach. In the majority of cases, the parietes of this pouch are attenuated ; but occa-

WOUNDS OF NECK. 235 the diseased mass. Attention to the last recommen- dation is important, in order to save bleeding. For when the trunks of the arteries are divided at the commencement of the dissection, they are easily secu- red temporarily by the fingers of an assistant; the operation is proceeded in and accomplished with scarcely any further haemorrhage, and in many in- stances no other vessels require ligature ; whereas if an opposite course be pursued, the same vessels will be divided three or four different times ; the haemorrhage will be greater, and the operation de- layed. By cutting also in the direction of the ves- sels and nerves, fewer arteries are divided, and nerves are less apt to be injured, than if the incisions were made across. Wounds inflicted with the view of effecting sui- cide are generally on the fore and upper part of the neck, and their severity depends on the resolu- tion of the individual. Some penetrate the integu- ments merely, and are consequently of slight extent; there is little bleeding, and the edges are easily brought together by inclining the head forwards, and introducing a few points of suture. Others divide the muscles, and branches of the lingual or of the superior thyroid arteries ; such are gaping, more ex- tensive than the former, and accompanied with smart haemorrhage. Some penetrate the mouth, separating the os hyoides, tongue, and epiglottis from the thy- roid cartilage. Occasionally the wound is lower, through the thyroid, or betwixt that cartilage and the cricoid; and sometimes through these into the

FOREIGN BODIES IN GULLET. 275 Coins may be removed by the forceps, or by the hook, if lodged at the narrow part of the passage behind the cricoid cartilage ; if lower, they generally defy attempts at extraction, and slip into the sto- mach gradually. Halfpennies, halfcrowns, &c. pass readily along the alimentary canal, and are voided in a short time. Tendinous or cartilaginous portions of hard meat, when within reach of the finger, can be laid hold of by the curved forceps, and pulled up. Smaller and soft portions, if impeded in the passage, as when it has been narrowed by previous disease, are dislodged and pushed down by the cautious use of a small probang, or oesophagus bougie. In the introduction of any instrument, attention should always be paid to the steps advised when treating of stricture of the gullet. CEsophagotomy is an operation that may, under some peculiar circumstances, be required. When a foreign body is of such a nature that, when once lodged in the gullet, it cannot be removed either up- wards or downwards, without serious laesion of the parts, and when breathing is impeded by its projec- tion, incision of the oesophagus may be warrantable. The operation is easily accomplished. An incision of about three inches is made in the superior trian- gular space of the neck, on the left side,â€”the gullet usually inclining to the left of the mesial line. It is commenced opposite to the os hyoides, and carried downwards parallel with the trachea ; and the use of the knife is continued till by cautious dissection the wound is- brought to the level of the common

DISEASES OE THE EVE. 149 ed at an early period ; its cut surface is unsound, and from this springs a fungus which grows rapidly. But under many circumstances the surgeon is not only justified in removing the orbital contents, but called upon to do so. The operation, though cruel and painful, need not be tedious. The commissure of the eyelids is divided with the point of a bistoury, and the fore part of the ball laid hold of firmly and deeply with a vulsellumâ€”that is, forceps provided with a double hook at each extremity of the blades. A straight bistoury is then entered at the margin ot the orbit, pushed down to the base, as near as possi- ble to the entrance of the optic nerve, and carried round the tumour rapidly, the blade being made to move more quickly than the point. The nerve is cut across, and after the removal of the morbid mass, the cavity is sponged out and examined. The lachry- mal gland, and other soft parts, particularly if alter- ed in texture, are raised with a hook, and removed by means of curved scissors. In young subjects, and in adults when the disease is far advanced, the parietes of the orbit are thin, softened, and atte- nuated by pressure ; the knife should therefore be used cautiously, and it is perhaps safer to finish excision with a narrow, curved, and probe-pointed bistoury, after having penetrated to the bottom of the orbit with a sharp-pointed knife; all other curious and crooked knives are of no use. Bleeding is restrained by charpie pressed, firmly and quickly, into the cavity, and supported by compresses and bandage ; but before introducing the dossils, all

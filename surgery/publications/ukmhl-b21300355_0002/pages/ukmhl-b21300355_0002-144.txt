134 DISEASES OF THE EYE. must be opened sufficiently for the escape of the lens. The eyelids are gently raised, a fine curved needle is introduced through the incision, and by it a crucial wound is made in the capsule. The lens is then either entangled in the point of the needle, and withdrawn ; or very gentle pressure is made on the globe, so as to force out the lens; and should it not readily pass through the wound of the cornea, it can be removed from the anterior chamber by a small scoop. After removal, the eye is allowed to rest; then careful examination is made, and if any opaque substance remain it is extracted by the needle or scoop. If the capsule is opaque, it must be taken away along with the lens. Before closing the eyelids the cor- neal flap should be carefully adjusted, and any mat- ter lodged between the divided surfaces removed : loose eyelashes are to be taken away, inverted ones extracted, and the margin of the lower lid should be so placed as not to disturb the flap. In transfixion, the point of the knife should not be brought out too low, nor too much towards the centre of the cornea; and care should be taken to avoid entanglement of the iris. When the iris falls for- wards so as to come under the edge of the knife, and be in danger of division should transfixion be pro- ceeded in, pressure may be made on the cornea, so that the remaining aqueous humour mny repress the iris from its untoward situation ; or the knife may be withdrawn and the operation delayed till the eye has become quiet, and the inflammation, if any, sub- sided ; or the incision may be completed with a blunt-

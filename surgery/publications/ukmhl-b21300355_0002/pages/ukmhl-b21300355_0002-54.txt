DISEASES OF THE SCALF. 1.1 the neck, axillae, or groins. The general health is materially impaired, especially in those cases which have been of long continuance, and in which the lymphatic system has ultimately become affected : in such, the patient, if very young, not unfrequent- ly sinks under the disease, after a long and linger- ing illness ; the mesenteric glands having become enlarged, and the process of nutrition being conse- quently interrupted, and the whole system having become enervated from the long continued local irri- tation. The disease has been divided into various kinds, into the larvalis, furfurans, lupinosa, scutulata, de- calvans, and favosa. The P. Larvalis is peculiar to infancy, and the part affected is generally the upper portion of the face. Numerous pustules appear on a reddened base, give way, and discharge a viscid fluid, which concretes into thin crusts. Fresh pus- tules appear, the discharge increases, the crusts be- come thicker, and in some instances envelope almost the whole countenance. When the crusts separate, the exposed surface appears inflamed and furrowed, and generally desquamates. -Thus the disease usual- ly terminates; but it not unfrequently commences afresh, and the crusts are renewed. From its occur- ring at an early age, it is apt to be followed by serious consequences, when neglected or of an obsti- nate nature, for the system is then ill fitted for with- standing much irritation. The P. Furfurans is generally met with in adults, more especially in females, and is confined to the

DISEASES OF THE EYE. 105 the cause of the suppression must be avoided. If a gonorrhoea have been suddenly arrested by the em- ployment of stimulating injections, these must be in- stantly discontinued; and some have even gone so far, in such cases, as to introduce bougies impreg- nated with gonorrheal matter, in order to procure a renewal of the discharge. In cases of suppression of purulent discharge from the ears, or the surrounding parts, followed by external ophthalmia, a blister or sinapism should be applied in the neighbourhood of the part from which the discharge formerly issued. When the menstrual evacuation has been arrested, leeches and fomentations should be applied to the pudenda* or around the anus, and emenagogues admi- nistered internally ; the patient should be placed in a quiet and well ventilated apartment, and kept free from any emotions of the mind, more especially anger; children ought to be kept out of the way, all noise and other sources of irritation avoided, and the patient's wishes immediately complied with, never thwarted. If the incited action in the eye do not subside, as it often will not, on removal of the exciting cause, recourse must immediately be had to very active means for its subjugation ; for in no other organ does inflammatory action proceed more rapidly to an unfavourable termination. By timely use of an- tiphlogistic means, these consequences of external ophthalmia, which we have already treated of, may be avoided; and with respect to most of them, it is much better to prevent their occurrence, than combat them after they have been allowed to take place.

DISEASES OF WINDPIPE. 257 paralysis of the muscles of the larynx, in consequence of effusion at the base of the brain, from long con- tinued irritation, as from an irritating cause seated in the mouth, and in old people from a general decay of the animal powers. In the last case, it is general- ly a symptom of approaching dissolution, as is the dysphagia which often attends it. Severe dyspnoea is sometimes caused by external violence. A fine healthy child, aged eight, in run- ning across the street, fell, and struck the larynx with great force upon a large stone. She was taken up quite lifeless, and some time elapsed before respi- ration was at all established. A gentleman finding her face livid, opened the temporal artery, and ap- plied leeches to the throat, with some relief. I saw her about three hours after the accident. The breath- ing, inspiration more particularly, was exceedingly difficult; and this appeared to proceed not only from the injury to the larynx, probably occasioning loss of power in the muscles, but from the collection of some fluid in the trachea and its ramifications. The child was evidently in such a state that, unless active measures were resorted to, and that speedily, a fatal termination would soon take place. Tracheotomy was performed ; a quantity of coagulated blood and bloody mucus was evacuated from the opening; and when the discharge and coughing had ceased, a tube was introduced. In a short time the tube was with- drawn, the aperture closed ; and no unfavourable symptom recurred. PART II. R

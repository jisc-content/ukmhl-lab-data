BRONCHOCELE. 286 has been strongly recommended ; and many patients are said to have been thus cured. I have tried it in one case only ; it certainly had the effect of dimi- nishing the swelling ; but for some time great trouble was experienced from bleeding, whenever the cord was drawn, and the patient afterwards became much weakened by the profuse discharge. The proposal to tie the thyroid arteries, for the cure of bronchocele, has been put in practice, but without a favourable result. Extirpation of such growths has been repeated ly attempted, but the patients, almost without excep- tion, have perished from haemorrhage, under the hands of the knivesmen. The immense supply of blood afforded to the gland in the healthy state, must be kept in mind, as also the enlargement of the ves- sels proportional to the increase of the part. Not arteries alone, but enormous veins, are to be encoun- tered. The tumour is in the vicinity of important organs, and of the trunks of large vessels and nerves, and probably has become attached to them. In short, the operation is attended with such risks, with so absolute a certainty almost of fatal result, as not to be warranted under any circumstances, far less for removal of deformity only. Enlargement of the isthmus alone gives rise to more severe symptoms apparently, and may war- rant an attempt at removal; but this can scarcely be accomplished altogether by incision. Such is my impression, and under this impression I proceeded cautiously in a case of this nature with which I had

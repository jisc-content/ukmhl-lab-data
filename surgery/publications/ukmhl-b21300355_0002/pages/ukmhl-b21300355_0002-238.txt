228 OSTEOSARCOMA OF JAW. and the bone twisted out. Separation of the remain- ing attachments is completed by a few rapid strokes of the knife, and the whole mass removed. Haemorr- hage is then to be permanently arrested, but instead of immediately tying every open mouth which pre- sents itself, it is better to expose the common trunk of the internal maxillary and temporal arteries—which is easily effected, as it emerges from under the digastric muscle—and to pass a ligature beneath it, by means of an aneurism needle. This is more quickly done than the applying of ligatures to the many branches of this trunk which have been divided. The other vessels—the facial, branches of the lingual, &c.—are then tied, the cavity is filled with charpie, and the in- cisions of the soft parts are carefully closed. In these, union by the first intention usually takes place nearly throughout the whole extent; suppuration occurs from the deep wound,the charpie isdislodgedgradatim. and removed, granulations spring up, and, after some time, the cavity is obliterated. The cheek must ne- cessarily fall inward very considerably, but the defor- mity is not to be compared to that caused by the tumour. During granulation, the patient is made comfortable by the frequent use of tepid gargles, lodgement of pus in the mouth being thereby dimi- nished. Articulation and mastication are not so perfect as when the jaw was entire and sound; but the patient gradually becomes accustomed to the want, and these functions improve. Partial para- lysis of the side of the face necessarily follows, for there is no possibility of accomplishing disarticula-

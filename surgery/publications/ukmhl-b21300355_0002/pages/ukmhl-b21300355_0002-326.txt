316 ONYCHIA instead of having lost substance, it is found of an unusually spongy and open texture, and with recent osseous matter superadded.

The general health is often impaired in consequence ; frequently the disease occurs in those of broken up constitution, along with sores and erup- tions on other parts of the surface, ulcerations of the mucous membranes, and other indications of cachexia.

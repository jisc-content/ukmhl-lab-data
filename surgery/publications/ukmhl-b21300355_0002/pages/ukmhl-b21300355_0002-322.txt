PARONYCHIA. 312 neither is exfoliation of the greater part of the distal phalanx always attended with much deformity or shortening, a nucleus being left from which bone may be reproduced. But destruction of the whole flexor or extensor tendons of one of the middle or proximal phalanges, or destruction of one of the articulations connecting them, is not only attended with great suffering, but followed by total uselessness of the part. The wounds may, after a tedious process, heal up, but the finger remains deformed and immovable, in a contracted or extended position, as may be. The disease may be occasioned by bruises or punc- tures, the instrument with which the puncture is inflicted being impregnated, or not, with some pu- trid animal matter. Violent inflammatory action almost uniformly follows opening of the articulations, and also lacerated wounds over the joints. Com- pound fractures and dislocations of the phalanges, are certainly followed by a severe form of inflamma- tion. But the disease is met with in all degrees of in- tensity, occurring without any assignable cause. It prevails in spring and autumn ; and is common in hard-working people, in butchers, cooks, &c. In superficial whitlow, the bowels must be attend- ed to, and blood may be abstracted locally, either by punctures or by the application of leeches along the side of the finger, hot fomentation being assiduously and regularly employed afterwards. Or the nitrate of silver may be rubbed lightly over the discoloured parts ; frequently the inflammation may be arrested, and resolution speedily effected by this simple appli- cation, laxative or purgative medicines being at the

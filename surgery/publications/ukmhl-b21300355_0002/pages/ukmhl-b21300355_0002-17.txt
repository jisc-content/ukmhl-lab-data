7 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. time by this means, but upon the circulation beco- ming again active, fresh haemorrhage must and does take place ; the parts around are separated and en- gorged more and more, the blood escapes in alarm- ing quantities, and the patient is saved only by the occurrence of syncope. To search for, and make a clean dissection of the wounded part of the vessel in such cases, is impossible. A long and deep incision must be made through the swollen and diseased parts in the course of the arterial branch, and a liga- ture passed under it, on each side of the ulcerated point, by means of the common curved suture-needle, or of one in a fixed handle. The ligatures should be at a considerable distance from each other, in order that they may surround healthy parts of the vessel; after they have been firmly tied, all risk of further haemorrhage is gone. Of course the ligatures should enclose as little as possible of the parts surrounding the artery. A poultice is perhaps the best applica- tion for a few days, and under its soothing influence the effects of the continued compression, which had been previously employed, soon subside. The after applications must be varied according to the appear- ances which the part presents. Laceration of a large or small Blood Vessel is a frequent consequence of Bruise of the Scalp.â€” Blood is effused, and the surrounding parts are there- by separated to a greater or less extent; and thus a tumour is formed, either rapidly or slowly, ac- cording to the size of the injured vessel, or the aper-

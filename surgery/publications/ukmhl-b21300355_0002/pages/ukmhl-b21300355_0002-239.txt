229 OSTEOSARCOMA OF JAW. tioii of the jaw, without dividing many branches of the portio dura. Supposing that the portion of the jaw between the angle and symphysis had been removed on account of osteosarcoma, and that the ramus subsequently became affected, it is no easy matter to effect disarti- culation, as I have experienced.â€”The patient was a female, aged thirty, of delicate constitution, and sub- ject to toothach from infancy. I removed an osteo- sarcomatous tumour, extending from the angle to the canine tooth, on the right side. Division was made wide of the existing disease, and the sawn surfaces appeared quite healthy ; but about five months after- wards, symptoms of return occurred in the ramus, and ten months after the first operation disarticula- tion was indispensable. The operation was accom- plished with very considerable difficulty, on account of there being no lever to overcome the action of the temporal muscle. After separating the attachments as much as possible, an attempt was made to force down the coronoid process, from under the zygoma, by pushing the lower end of the bone backwards, in order to divide the insertion of the temporal muscle ; but this proved ineffectual. The capsular ligament of the joint was then divided, and the bone with dif- ficulty turned over from behind, forwards. It was then detached underneath the coronoid process, pulled down from under the zygoma, and the temporal muscle at length divided at its insertion. In none of these operations is there a necessity for preliminary exposure and ligature of either the caro-

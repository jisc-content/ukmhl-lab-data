156 l'OLYPUS OF THE NOSE. of air, and when the forceps can be passed along the floor of the cavity, and are expanded and shut without meeting any obstruction, examination is to be made with the finger. In those who have long laboured under the disease, the fissure between the cavities is so much expanded as to admit the little finger easily, and by it the situation of the remaining tumours is ascertained, and instruments guided to them. After the operation the nostrils are stuffed gently with lint to prevent the access of cold air ; and if the haemorrhage be profuse, long pieces of lint pushed well back will generally be sufficient to arrest it; if not, the posterior cavity must be plugged from behind. It is prudent to prepare for the stuffing posteriorly in bad cases in which violent haemorrhage may be expected. Instruments with springs, &c. have been contrived for the purpose, but are useless, and cannot always be had. A loop of thin flexible wire, or of thick catgut, is passed along the floor of the nostril, and on reach- ing the throat is caught by the finger, or by a hook or forceps, and brought into the mouth. A piece of strong thread is then attached to the wire or catgut, and the latter is withdrawn, one extremity of the thread hanging from the nostril, the other from the mouth. To the middle of the thread a piece of lint rolled up to the size of the point of the thumb is affixed, and this is pulled back into the mouth, and directed into the posterior nares with the fingers ; and by the pressure of these, and by pulling at tlie thread, the dossil is firmly wedged into the aperture.

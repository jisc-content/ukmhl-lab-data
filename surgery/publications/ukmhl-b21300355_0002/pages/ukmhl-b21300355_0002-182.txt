The operation should not be per- formed in very cold weather, and even in summer the patient should be enjoined not to leave his chamber. The lint may be removed in three or four days, and then, too, some of the stitches may perhaps be dis- pensed with. The flap will be found adherent, but loose, and raised by every expiration ; very soon granulations rise from the inner surface, the part derives support from below, and becoming firm, pre- serves its form well. It will be necessary during the cure to keep the nostrils of their proper size and shape, by means of well fitted tubes. Nothing has as yet been said of the columna. In the Indian operation it is provided for by a slip pur- posely brought down from the forehead, and attached to the point which the root of the original columna occupied. Their flap is of this shape. In the greater number of foreheads, an encroachment must be made on the hairy scalp, in order to obtain this part of the flap ; and after bringing it down and ingrafting it into the lip, there is a risk of its not adhe- ring, as happened in a case on which I operated some years ago. Besides, during the healing of the internal surface, it will be difficult to prevent it from shortening, and turning inwards upon itself, and thus pulling down the apex of the nose. In the case to which I alluded, a colnmna was made, after consolida-

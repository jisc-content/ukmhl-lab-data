212 TUMOURS UNDER THE TONGUE. smooth or roughened by nodules; in all, the calcareous matter is friable, and disposed in concentric layers. They are of the same nature as the earthy deposits, called tartar, which form on those teeth opposite to the extremities of the salivary ducts. The foreign body produces uneasiness in the mouth, swelling, and indistinctness of speech : occasionally painful swelling of the salivary gland and surrounding parts takes place. Concretions also form, though very rarely, in the extremity of the parotid duct, and are attended with like inconvenience ; of this I have seen only two cases. The foreign body is easily removed; an incision is made through the membrane of the mouth, and the concretion dislodged by forceps, a scoop, or the fingers. The saliva regains its course, and irritation subside. Tumours, unconnected with the salivary ducts, occasionally form in the loose cellular tissue under the tongue. They may be either sarcomatous or encysted; the former are rare. I have removed several solid tumours, principally adipose, from this situation. They were loosely connected, and taken away without almost any dissection; indeed they were lifted out with the fingers, after division of the membrane of the mouth and of the cellular cyst which surrounded them. One was as large as an orange, and of a flattened form. The tongue had been displaced by the swelling, and articulation, deglutition, and breathing impeded. The patient, an old lady, had a good recovery. The case had been

STRICTURE OF GULLET. 269 The prominent symptom of stricture of the oeso- phagus is difficult deglutition. Some patients can swallow only liquids ; and when an attempt is made to get over any solid suhstance, this is stopped at the contraction, and completely obstructs the passage. In such cases, patients will frequently apply for relief, in order that the portion of food may be pushed through the narrowed passage ; with the accomplish- ment of this many are quite satisfied, and are unwill- ing to submit to farther treatment, obstruction to solid matter being the only inconvenience experienced. But when contraction is great, and the involved por- tion of the canal almost obliterated, little food of any kind can pass into the stomach, the patient becomes feeble and emaciated, and ultimately dies from inani- tion. The subjects of this affection are generally far advanced in years, and in them it often occurs with- out any evident cause. If pharyngitis have subsided, either spontaneously or after antiphlogistic treatment, and symptoms of stricture supervene, the existence or non-existence of this latter disease must be ascertained by gentle and cautious introduction of a gum-elastic bougie or ivory- ball probe. If stricture exist, the descent of the in- strument will be resisted at the contracted point, and most frequently at the lower part of the pharynx; this, in the adult, will be at a distance of about nine inches from the incisor teeth. When the seat of the stricture is ascertained, a bougie is to be introduced, sufficiently small to pass through it; and when this has been pushed beyond, the disease, if unattended

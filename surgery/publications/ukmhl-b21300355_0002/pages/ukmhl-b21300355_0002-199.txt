No further dressing is required, for rea- sons already assigned. The forceps of different kinds for holding the edge during its removal are worse than useless ; and paring with scissors is to be repro- bated, as an effectual means of preventing immediate union. By the plan above recommended, bruising is avoided, and union takes place rapidly. Fissures, more or less extensive, of the hard pa- late, generally attend double harelip. The position and size of the intermediate portion of the lip, and of the superior maxillary bone, are various ; and the operator, in forming his plan of procedure, must be guided by the state of the parts. If the fissures are not very wide—if .the intermediate portion of bone, that adhering to the septum narium, is not promi- nent—and if the soft parts covering this are free and long, the operative procedure is simple.

Thereby the intervening flap is united first to one side, and then to the other.

Besides, great, though gradual, change of structure has in all pro- bability taken place. In several such cases, I have attempted to restore the natural dimensions of the passage, by the occasional introduction of bougies, gradually increased in size ; but in none have I com- pletely succeeded, except in the case of attempted suicide which has been already detailed shortly.

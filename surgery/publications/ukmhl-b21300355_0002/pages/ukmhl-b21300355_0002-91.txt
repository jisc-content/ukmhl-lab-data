DISEASES OF THE EYE. 81 Entropion, or inversion, may consist either in turning inwards of the cilia alone, without change of position in the eyelid, or in inversion of the lid itself; both kinds are sufficiently common. The disease generally takes place during inflammation and swell- ing of the conjunctival lining of the lid. During violent inflammation of the lid, the conjuntiva and integuments are much swollen, and bulge out exter- nally; by the projection the margin is forced mechani- cally towards the ball, and entropion takes place. But in this state of matters, should the lid be by any chance everted, and not replaced, then the bulging is from the conjunctival surface, and prevents the margin from regaining its former site, and perma- nent eversion or ectropion occurs. In fact, inver- sion and eversion, like phymosis and paraphimosis, exist from the same parts being put in different re- lation to each other. More permanent entropion is caused by the contraction which follows removal of tumours from the under surface of the lids, or de- struction of large portions of the conjunctiva. The disease is most frequently met with in the upper lid. Great irritation is caused by friction of the hairs and edge of the lid on the sensible surface of the eyeball. Inflammation is frequently kindled, and kept up by the continued irritation; it is accompanied by its usual distressing symptoms when seated in that organ, and too often followed by a greater or less number of its untoward consequences. But all these evil effects may occur, without any change in the position of the edge of the lid, from irregular growth of the part n. f

INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 4 cases, as by a handkerchief, split cloths, or a roller applied in various forms. Wwinds of the Temporal Artery are either the result of accident, or made intentionally for the purpose of abstracting blood ; and it may be here proper to make a few remarks regarding this latter circumstance. When it is wished to take away blood from the head, no one thinks of opening the trunk of the temporal artery; its anterior branch is generally chosen. By some the vessel is first exposed by means of a scalpel, and then opened with a lancet, but preliminary incisions are alto- gether unnecessary. The vessel ought not to be cut entirely through, and the incision should extend obliquely across its course ; and care is to be taken that the external aperture shall be larger than that in the cellular tissue involving the artery, as thus the blood escapes freely, and no risk is incurred of its becoming infiltrated into the surrounding parts. When the branch is of the ordinary size, a sufficient quantity of blood is readily obtained from it; if, from its small size, or a faulty form of incision, blood does not flow freely and quickly, a cupping- glass may be applied, and its lower edge slightly raised. This latter precaution is absolutely neces- sary, for if it is neglected, little or no blood can escape, the artery being firmly compressed against the cranium by the edge of the exhausted glass. No other mode of cupping ought to be practised on the temples, for the cupping by scarification is both

LIGATURE OF SUBCLAVIAN. 301 but in general the common one is sufficient. During the dissection it must be borne in mind that the pleura is not far from the edge of the knife. Ligature of the Subclavian Artery is required for the cure of axillary aneurism. That portion of the vessel within the scalenus is unfavourable for opera- tion, in consequence of many branches being given off in an exceedingly short space. Besides, important veins and nerves are in the immediate vicinity. And though these were avoided, and the vessel reached and tied, still there would be no likelihood of a favourable result; obliteration of the vessel would not be expect- ed to take place at the deligated point, one or more collateral branches arising close to the ligature. On the outside of the scalenus there is no such objection. But the vessel is deep, even in the healthy state, and much more so when aneurism has appeared in the axilla, and attained but a small size. When the tumour is large, the shoulder is much elevated, and firmly fixed in its exalted level, greatly increasing the depth of the vessel. The shoulder is to be depressed as much as possible, and the head thrown to the opposite side. An inci- sion is made along the upper margin of the clavicle, and a second perpendicular to the first. These must be proportioned to the size of the patient, and the supposed depth of the vessel. It is better to err in making the external incisions too large than too small; neither the pain nor the duration of the cure is much increased thereby. But by an opposite course,

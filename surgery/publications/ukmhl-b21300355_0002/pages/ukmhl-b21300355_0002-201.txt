191 CONGENITAL DEFICIENCIES. When the hard palate is deficient, the patient is subjected to great inconvenience from food escaping into the cavities of the nose, and, in later life, horrid wretchedness of articulation occurs. It can readily be understood, that surgery is of very little avail here. Recourse must be had to mechanical contri- vance. A plate of metal (gold or platina), or a piece of ivory, or of sea-horse bone, may be fitted to the opening, and retained either by accurate adaptation, having sponge or caoutchouc attached to the upper surface, or by wires, elastic or not, resting on the neighbouring teeth. It may be made of a piece with artificial teeth if any are required. The sponge is ob- jectionable, as retaining the discharge, and thereby imparting an unpleasant odour to the expired air. But it is no easy matter, and often altogether impracticable, to retain such apparatus when the soft palate is also deficient. The time at which such contrivance is to be adapted may admit of some dispute. If done early in life, the natural tendency of the parts to ap- proximate may be interfered with and subverted; if dispensed with till a later period, the patient gets into a habit of snuffling and speaking so indistinctly that the closing of the aperture is productive of little or no improvement. Perhaps the period of com- mencing the child's education should be delayed till he be seven, eight, nine, or even ten years of age, and then the artificial palate may be applied advan- tageously in every respect. Fissure of the soft palate is usually accompanied with separation of the bones from which it is sus-

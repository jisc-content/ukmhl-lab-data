ENLARGEMENT OF TONGUE. 209 diately beneath the investing membrane. There was occasional bleeding from an ulcerated fissure near the centre of the dorsum, and also from the lateral parts of the protruded portion; in the latter situation, several cicatrices were visible. Saliva flowed in a continuous stream from the apex of the tumour. The lower jaw much separated from the upper, was elon- gated and unusually narrow ; the teeth, particularly those in front, were placed at a distance from each other, were covered with tartar, and projected almost horizontally from the sockets. A depression was felt at the symphysis menti, as if the two portions of the jaw were asunder, and the intervening space occu- pied by ligamentous or cartilaginous matter. The enlargement was congenital, and the organ swelled rapidly every three months to a much larger size, and subsided gradually. The bleeding was most fre- quent and profuse when the swelling was greatest, and then too he suffered much pain in the part. Articulation was very indistinct, and could be under- stood only by those who were accustomed to be near him. He swallowed, and even masticated pretty freely. From the periodical enlargement and dimi- nution, from the repeated haemorrhages, and from erectile tissue being visible on many parts of the sur- face, I considered the structure of the tumour to be in part similar to that of aneurism by anastomosis, and to be throughout extremely vascular. I there- fore did not attempt removal by incision, but inter- cepted its vascular supply by tying both lingual arteries. The tumour was not affected immediately part II. o

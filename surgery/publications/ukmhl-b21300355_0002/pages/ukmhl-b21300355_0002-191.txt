181 ABSCESS OF THE ANTRUM. part, an opening may be made from the extremities of the fangs having projected into the cavity ; it is in a good situation, but cannot be made of sufficient size ; an aperture of but small extent may be suffi- cient for the draining of an abscess in soft parts, but here the divided texture is unyielding, and the per- foration must be free. Bad teeth are taken away with the view of abstracting a source of irritation which may give rise to, keep up, or induce a return of collection in the antrum ; but extraction of sound teeth, to obtain an exit for the matter, is not war- rantable. Even when they are extracted for a diffe- rent reason, and discharge of matter follows, the sur- geon must not be contented, but must make another and more efficient opening. The membrane of the mouth is to be divided on the forepart of the maxil- lary bone, immediately above the first small grinder, and a large perforator then pushed into the antral cavity ; little force is required, for the parietes are soft and partially absorbed. The perforation should be of a size sufficient to admit the little finger; thereby a free and dependent exit is allowed for the concrete as well as the fluid matter. If the discharge is very foetid, and long of drying up, and if there is an appearance of disease in the osseous parietes, in- jections into the cavity may be required, though sel- dom. In general the discharge gradually diminishes, the membrane of the antrum resumes its healthy condition and functions, and the aperture in its parietes is shut by a fine ligamentous substance.

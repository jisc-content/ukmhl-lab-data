INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 27 less extent. Again, if a person falls from a height, he perhaps alights on some part of his trunk, as the buttocks, and this coming to a state of rest, whilst the head is still in projectile motion, the spinal co- lumn is driven towards the cavity of the cranium, and the same effects are thereby produced as in the preceding instance. Or the patient alights on his head, and the base of the cranium is then impinged upon by the weight of the whole trunk, as well as by the force of the projecting power, and in this case also the base is frequently broken up. Concussion has resulted from falls when the person has alighted on his nates or feet; but the symptoms attendant on fracture of the base are more generally those of compression of the brain. In this accident the bones are seldom displaced to any great extent; the dura mater is generally lacerated, its blood-vessels, and frequently its sinuses, are wounded, and blood is con- sequently effused at the base of the brain, which is the most important part of that organ. The upper part of the brain may bear pressure to a consider- able degree without bad consequences ensuing, but compression at the origins of the nerves is always highly dangerous and generally fatal. Bleeding from the nose, mouth, and ears has been considered, when attended with other circumstances and symptoms evincing a receipt of violent injury and consequent cerebral disturbance, as decisive of fracture at the base having occurred. But we find that such bleed- ing happens in slight injuries unattended with any circumstances or consequences to induce a belief that

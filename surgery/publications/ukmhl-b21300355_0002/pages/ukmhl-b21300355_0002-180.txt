RHENOPJiASTIC OPERATIONS. 170 deficient parts were then made raw, and the new substance was affixed by suture ; the original at- tachment was preserved entire, and the patient kept in a constrained position—the arm and head being approximated and bound together by apparatus— for many days, till union occurred. Then the flap was separated entirely, and the new nose moulded into its proper form, by subsequent paring and com- pression. The Rhinoplastic operation, introduced from India —where from time immemorial it has beenpractised by one of the castes—has superseded the preceding, and is variously modified. It is less difficult in execution, not so liable to failure, and more easily undergone by the patient. The same preparation of the flap is not required, though it is said that the Indian operators are in the habit of previously pummelling, with the heel of their slipper, the integument to be used for the new nose, so as to excite the circulation and produce thickening ; from the similarity of texture in the integument of the face, its application to a new situ- ation is not much observed. The apex and alse can be readily repaired by a flap of proper shape and dimensions from the fore- head. The cicatrized edges where the nose for- merly rested, must, in the first place, be dissected off pretty deeply, so as to be prepared for the at- tachment of the new appendage. The size of the lost organ, and the dimensions necessary for its re- placement, are then to be taken into consideration. It is recommended to make a mould in wax of the

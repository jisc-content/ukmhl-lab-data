36 INJUltlKS OF THE HEAD. portions of its substance may be either severely inju- red, or entirely separated. Loss of substance, even to a considerable extent, in the upper part of the he- mispheres, may occur, without bad symptoms or con- sequences ensuing. The exposed surface of the brain granulates, and is healed as other parts of soft struc- ture. Generally, however, untoward symptoms re- sult sooner or later in such cases. Haemorrhage occurs from the injured part, and a clot protrudes from the external wound. Or the cerebral substance in the neighbourhood of the wound softens, and be- comes converted into a semi-fluid mass, often mixed with pus ; and a fungous growth, connected with the disorganized matter, gradually protrudes through the aperture in the cranium, and is repressed with diffi- culty. If removed by knife or ligature, it is rapidly reproduced. Pressure is the only means left by which to attempt its retardation ; and it, too, is ineffectual: for if not very moderate, the effects of compression extend from the fungus to the whole of the brain, and an impairment of the sensorial functions in a greater or less degree necessarily results. The formation of such a growth is generally attended with shivering, sickness, and fever, by a weak, rapid, and irregular pulse ; the strength declines, convulsions and delirium supervene, and coma terminates the symptoms. Perforation of the Cranium is not often resorted to since the treatment of injuries of the head has become better understood. In former times, the ope- ration of trepan was performed frequently, and many

121 DISEASES OF THE EYE. during twilight vision improves, as then the pupil becomes dilated, and admits of transmission of light through a portion of the transparent vitreous humour, as well as through the semi-opaque margins of the chrystalline lens : for a similar reason, it is also more distinct after the application of belladonna or hyos- cyamus either to the eye or to its neighbourhood. In the ordinary state of parts, a clear, black ring is often visible around the opacity, either from the margins of the lens being unaffected, or from the posterior surface of the pupillary portion of the iris being pushed forwards by enlargement of the lens. Patients, having become aware of the great improvement of vision caused by dilatation of the pupil, are often con- tented to use narcotic remedies externally, such as bel- ladonna or hyoscyamus, so long as they retain their dilating influence—and, strange to say, they do not soon lose it—instead of submitting to any operation. As cataract advances, even luminous bodies cannot be accurately distinguished, though the situation from which the light proceeds is perceived ; thus the patient in a clear light may have an indistinct per- ception of a candle or window, and in some cases even of the bars of the window. The motions of the iris are not affected, unless, in rare cases, when the cataract is large and compresses the iris ; or when the functions of the third pair of nerves have been in any way impaired; or when the iris has been the seat of acute inflammation. Cataract may be confounded with other diseases

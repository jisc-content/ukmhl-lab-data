216 INFLAMMATION AND ABSCESS OF THE GUMS. dom resist the action long, but from their low degree of vitality soon become necrosed ; and by the pre- sence of the dead portions of bone, a fresh accession is given to the disease. Severe pain is experienced on touching the teeth whose alveoli are affected ; they project and become loose ; purulent matter is secreted, and oozes out between the loosened teeth and diseased gums. Abscesses form, and point in different situations ; the gums are tumid and spongy; through the openings in them the bone can be felt bare, and the purulent matter is situated within or around the alveoli, and under the mucous membrane and cellular tissue which invest them. When the inflammation has been either intense from the first, or of long duration, it not unfre- quently happens that abscesses form within the sub- stance of the jawbone, and occasionally to a consider- able extentâ€”a portion of the bone having become inflamed, and the action terminating in suppuration and partial caries. This is more apt to occur in the inferior than in the superior maxillary bone; and, if allowed to proceed, the osseous cyst contain- ing the purulent matter gradually enlarges, its pa- rietes become attenuated, and the affection is termed spina ventosa. Purulent collections in this situation also seem, in many instances, to arise from, or at least to be preceded by, the formation of a cyst around the decayed root of a tooth. Such cysts are generally of small size, and pyriforin shape ; exter- nally they are smooth, membranous, and of rather a delicate texture ; internally, they are lined by lymph of soft consistence, and contain purulent matter.

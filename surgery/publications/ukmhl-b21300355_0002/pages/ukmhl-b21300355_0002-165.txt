155 POLYPUS OF THE NOSE. sive, a small curved blunt-pointed bistoury, or probe- scissors may be employed for their separation ; some- times the tumours can be pushed off by the finger, or by a probe with a blunt and forked extremity ; then they either are blown out by the patient, or fall into the posterior cavity, thence into the pharynx, and are coughed up or swallowed. In cases such as are usually met with, forceps and a small vulsellum are the best instruments. The forceps should be about half the size of those generally used or sold by cutlers as polypus forceps. The patient is seated facing a good light, and the body of the prominent tumour is laid hold of by the vulsellum ; the forceps are then introduced, with the blades expanded, and carried backwards so as to reach its neck, which is firmly grasped by the instrument, and gently twist- ed, so as to separate its connexions with the mem- brane. No force, no jerking or pulling is allowable. It may happen even with the gentlest and most care- ful management, that a small fragment of bone comes away along with the tumour; but this generally can or should be avoided : the cure is not rendered more certain by such an occurrence, as has been supposed. One tumour being thus detached, the same process is repeated with the others, till the cavity is cleared so far as haemorrhage or the patient's fortitude will admit. Both nostrils, if, as is usually the case, both are stuffed, may be emptied at the first sitting, so as to enable the patient to blow through them. When the tumours filling the passage to the throat have been removed, so as to allow the ready egress and ingress

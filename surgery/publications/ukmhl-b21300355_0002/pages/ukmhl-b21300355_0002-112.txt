DISEASES OF THE EYE. 102 The cornea is thickened, prominent, and opaque; and in most cases vision is either much impaired or entirely lost. The prominence varies in different cases, being sometimes very little elevated beyond the natural state of the part, while in other instances it protrudes from between the eyelids. After having attained a certain size it often becomes stationary; but very frequently it continues to enlarge gradu- ally. When the prominence is large, much incon- venience arises from the eyelids not being allowed to close; and the eye, being thereby deprived of its natural covering, is extremely liable to become in- flamed from external irritation. When one eye is affected with staphyloma, the other sooner or later becomes similarly diseased. Dropsy of the anterior chamber, or Hydr-ophthal- mia, occasionally takes place in persons of weak con- stitutions. The aqueous humour is either secreted in greater abundance than it usually is, or absorption is diminished. The cornea gradually accomodates itself to the increase of the fluid behind, and becomes wider and more prominent, but retains its transparency; in looking at the eye, the anterior chamber is seen evi- dently enlarged, and occasionally the aqueous humour is of a turbid appearance. There is little or no pain in the eyeball, but the patient complains of an annoy- ing sense of fulness and tension in the part. In con- sequence of the vitreous humour also accumulating, the whole organ is ultimately enlarged considerably, and its motions are thereby much impeded. At first, vision of near objects is impaired, whilst the patient

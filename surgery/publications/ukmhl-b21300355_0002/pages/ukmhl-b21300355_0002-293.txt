283 AFFECTIONS OF EAR. tal deficiency, or by pressure of neighbouring swell- ings, or of morbid growths, producing temporary or permanent obstruction. None but the first cause could possibly admit of the use of the probe, and even then it can scarcely be required. By removal of the cause of such turgescence at the end of the tube, or in the neighbouring parts,—which can often be detected, being local,—by counter-irritation, &c. a cure is much more likely to be effected than by the intro- duction of probes. Not that the operation is exceed- ingly difficult, for, after practice on the dead body, a probe can readily be passed into the eustachian tube from the nostril. The instrument is fixed in a handle, with its point slightly bent, and on the handle there should be a mark to show the direction of the point; the distance of the termination of the tube from the nasal orifice ought also to be marked. The instru- ment is passed along the floor of the nostril, and then its point is directed upwards and outwards, whilst the handle is pressed towards the septum narium. Puncture of the tympanum has been recommended as a remedy for deafness arising, or supposed to arise, from obstruction of the eustachian tube ; but I be- lieve it has not succeeded in above one out of twenty cases. The puncture is apt to close very soon, and though the hearing may be improved for a short time, the advantage gained soon disappears. The means of keeping the puncture open are not easily applicable ; perhaps the most effectual is to touch the edges occasionally with pencil-pointed lunar stone. The puncture is generally made with a short-pointed

ACCIDENTS AT BEND OF ARM. 305 proceedings are more simple. The incisions are made in the direction of the bleeding point; this is reached, and each extremity of the vessel tied. The lower third of the artery is less involved with the vein and nerves, and can be reached without divi- sion of muscular fibres. The arm is abducted and elevated as much as possible. The axilla is thus ex- posed. A free incision is made in the course of the vessel, which, by cautious dissection, is brought into view; it can then be dealt with as may be required. Spontaneous aneurism is of rare occurrence lower in the brachial artery than its axillary portion. However, it is sometimes met with at the bend of the arm. But the aneurismal tumour in this situa- tion is more frequently the consequence of wound of the vessel, inflicted whilst opening a superimposed vein. The mode of proceeding in venesection, the precautions to be employed, and the evils that some- times follow this little operation, will be treated of by and by. Wounding of the artery is not so com- mon an accident now as formerly. Venesection is not so universally and unnecessarily resorted to, and is performed by better instructed practitioners. Puncture of the brachial artery, at the bend of the arm, is not uniformly followed by extravasation of blood, or by the formation of aneurism. That it is wounded, is known by the impetuous and saltatory flow of florid blood, accompanied with a whizzing noise. In such circumstances, the thumb is placed firmly over the wound ; the fingers separately, the hand, and the forearm are supported by uniform PART II. u

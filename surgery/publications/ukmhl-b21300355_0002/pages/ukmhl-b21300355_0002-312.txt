LIGATURE OF SUBCLAVIAN. 302 both the difficulties and the dangers of the operation are rendered far greater. The external jugular vein must be avoided if possible by the knife; it should be detached slightly, and pulled inwards. .The supra- scapular artery, running in a line with the clavicle, ought also to be saved; it acts a principal part in performing the anastomosing circulation after liga- ture of the trunk, and although the arm would receive a sufficiency of blood from other branches, it is well to keep this entireâ€”-not to mention the trouble which wound of it would occasion the operator, by constant- ly filling his incisions with blood, and the delay caused by the application of ligature to the bleeding extremi- ties. Its division can easily be guarded against, and should be avoided. The subclavian vein is not in the way ; it is lower down, under the clavicle, than where the surgeon requires to introduce his instruments. The fascia and cellular tissue is divided carefully, until the cervical plexus of nerves appears, and then the artery is to be looked for on the same level with the plexus, and towards its sternal margin. But in cutting for this or any other vessel, it must be recol- lected that pulsation is a very uncertain guide. It is communicated to the neighbouring parts, and often is scarcely to be felt at all, or is at least very indis- tinct. In any situation pulsation is very perceptible before division of the integuments, and other super- imposed parts; but after resistance has been re- moved by exposure of the vessel, it ceases almost entirely. Feeling is the principal guide, and, to ex- perienced fingers, the feel of nerves is different from

LIGATURE OF CAROTID. 299 rash, there is little risk of the vein or par vagum being injured ; to include them along with the artery- would argue no small possession of most deplorable ignorance.

It is then divided, and one half retained, whilst the other is withdrawn along with the needle. The vessel must not be raised up from its situation, or detached from its cellular and vascular connexions, more than is merely sufficient for transmission of the needle. A single knot is cast upon the remaining half of the ligature, passed down, and tied firmly on the vessel, by the forefingers of the operator. This is secured by the finger of an assistant, whilst the ends are again passed through, so as to complete the Reef-knot, and run down tight as before, the assist- ant slowly withdrawing his finger to make way for the ligature. A third knot may be made to ensure security, but is seldom, if ever, necessary. As already observed, every thing must be done with deliberation and caution, and the operation may be thus safely concluded in a very few minutes. One end of the ligature may be cut away close to the knot, or both brought out of the wound. The edges of the wound are put together, after all oozing has ceased, by one or two stitches, and the intermediate application of isinglass plaster; bandaging is unnecessary, and might be hurtful. The patient is placed in bed, with the head elevated considerably, so as to relax the neck. The wound will probably heal by the first intention,

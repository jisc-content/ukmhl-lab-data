254 DISEASES OF WINDPIPE. quently by hectic fever. From extension of the ulcer- ation, the vocal chords, the ventricles of the larynx, and the mucous folds forming the riina glottidis, are more or less injured, and frequently altogether obli- terated ; partial or complete aphonia is the conse- quence. From the reasons which have been already stated, inspiration is performed with difficulty, and accom- panied with a wheezing and rattling sound, resem- bling the passage of air through a narrow aperture lined with viscid fluid. Deglutition is difficult; and, from the inactive state of the muscles which naturally close the glottis during swallowing, and from the greater or less destruction of the epiglottis, a portion of the fluid taken into the mouth escapes into the windpipe, produces violent coughing, and is ejected by the mouth or nostrils. As the disease advances, the lungs become affected, the patient is incapacitated for ordinary exertion by the dyspnoea which ensues, he grows weak and languid, and seems, in fact, to labour under phthisis pulmonalis. Not unfrequently the two diseases are combined; but, in the majority of cases, the affection of the lungs supervenes on that of the larynx. When the ulceration extends deeply, portions of the cartilages sometimes become diseased ; the soft parts surrounding them are destroyed, they be- come necrosed, and are expectorated along with a quantity of highly foetid purulent fluid. In some instances, the expectorated portions are osseous, of loose texture, irregular margins, and dark colour, and

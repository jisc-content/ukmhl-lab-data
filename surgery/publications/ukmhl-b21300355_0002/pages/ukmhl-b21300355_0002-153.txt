143 DISEASES OF THE EYE. forehead are in a perpendicular direction, their mar- gins are easily preserved in apposition, having little tendency to retract, and there is no risk of the rela- tive situation of the eyelids being altered. If there be considerable loss of substance in the lower part of the forehead, from the nature of the wound, when inflicted, or from its having become the seat of un- healthy suppuration, on cicatrization of the part the eyelid will be drawn upwards, and perhaps more or less everted. There is reason to believe that a degree of blindness, and even complete amaurosis, has been caused by wound of the eyebrow, the superciliary nerve having been contused, wounded, or otherwise injured ; or the functions of the eyeball may be dis- turbed by concussion from injury. Paralysis, also, of the levator palpebral superioris, or of several of the muscles belonging to the eyeball, may follow injury of the forehead and neighbouring parts, from either laceration or concussion of the nerves. Wounds of the eyelids, particularly when neglected, may cause much change of relative situation in the parts, and thereby produce both inconvenience and deformity. In wounds, such as those above mentioned, it is of great importance to bring the raw edges into contact, and retain them so; and in most cases, one or more points of interrupted suture are necessary. Adhesive plaster may be at the same time applied, but of itself is insufficient to effect permanent coaptation. Wounds of the eyeball, however slight, require much attention, being inflicted on an important and highly sensible organ, and there being always a risk of de-

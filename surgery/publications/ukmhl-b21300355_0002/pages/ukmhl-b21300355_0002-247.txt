237 WOUNDS OF NECK. Some patients seem to be going on most favourably towards a cure, but within two days after the injury, are suddenly seized with difficult breathing, and die in a few minutes. On the examination of such, blood is sometimes found in the ramifications of the bron- chial tubes, and the lungs contain little or no air; or the bronchial tubes and ramifications are loaded with adherent mucus; in either case the patients die from -asphyxia. In others, nothing remarkable is observed; perhaps passage of the air is prevented by inspissated mucus lodging in the windpipe around the wound, and closing the aperture, or by faulty adaptation of the divided surfaces. Likewise, during motion of the head, or attempts to swallow, either the upper or lower part of the windpipe may change its relative position ; the continuity of the tube will be thereby destroyed, either partially or wholly, and suffocation ensue. When the wound is large and transverse, as the majority of such wounds are, there is difficulty in freeing the air passage from mucus. This result be- comes evident, when we consider how coughing is effected in the healthy state of partsâ€”that the upper part of the windpipe is contracted by its own muscles, and the air driven through, by sudden action of the muscles of the chest, in a forcible and small stream, so as to carry the mucus along with it. This pro- cess cannot be accomplished when the muscles em- ployed in contracting the orifice of the larynx are in- jured, or when an opening is formed below the glot- tis, through which the patient breathes, either wholly or in part.

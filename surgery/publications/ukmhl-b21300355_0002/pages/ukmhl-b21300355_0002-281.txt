Bougies armed with caustic in their points have been recommended, but are unnecessary, the simple bougie being sufficient to remove the disease, if skilfully employed ; besides, their use is not unattended with danger, ulceration being frequently produced. In very bad cases, in which the stricture is long in yield- ing to the means already mentioned, and the nutri- ment which the patient is able to swallow is neces- sarily small,—when the canal is altogether oblitera- ted either at one point or to a considerable extent, and when there is consequently little hope of success from any treatment—the strength of the patient may be supported, and life prolonged for some time by the use of nutritive enemata.

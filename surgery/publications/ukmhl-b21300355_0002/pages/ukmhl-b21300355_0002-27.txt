If the circulation becomes unduly excited, abstrac- tion of blood from the system, in sufficient quantities and at proper intervals, is absolutely necessary ; and the depletion must be regulated by the symptoms and circumstances of each case. The action will in gene- ral be more speedily and effectually moderated by one copious bleeding at the commencement, than by re- peated bleedings to a less extent. An easy and. open state of the bowels is of much importance in the ex- cited stage. Mercurial preparations are sometimes of use, being found to possess, in some degree, the power of preventing lymphatic or other effusions on the cerebral membranes. In cases where insensibility continues after the ar- terial excitement has been subdued, counter irritation on the head or the back of the neck is often useful, as the application of blisters, or the rubbing in of antimonial ointment; these being supposed to act by causing an unusual influx of blood to the surface, pro- ducing a change in that fluid by the copious purulent, serous, and lymphatic secretions from the irritated part, and thereby diminishing the distended and en- gorged state of the internal vessels, which might pro- duce considerable compression of the brain. If, at a late period in the case, the powers of life begin to flag, stimulants must be again had recourse PART II, B

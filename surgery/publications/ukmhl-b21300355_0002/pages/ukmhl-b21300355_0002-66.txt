56 DISEASES OF THE SCALP. the scalp, and when it is still limited to the superfi- cial parts, it may be removed by the knife; the in- cisions being made at a considerable distance from the margins of the ulcer, so that those parts which may be supposed to have assumed a disposition to malignant action, may be taken away along with the ulcer.

The actual cautery cannot be applied with safety to the cranium. Even where the integu- ments only are removed, and that to a small extent and in a proper form, it is vain to think of approxi- mating the parts and procuring union by adhesion; the wound must granulate. There is no difficulty in suppressing haemorrhage; either ligature or tempc~ rary pressure may be employed according to circum- stances. Mild dressings are to be applied, and proper support afforded. The parts should be kept clean, and for that purpose the surrounding scalp must be shaved repeatedly.

The latter are easily removed, being seldom of large size, and their at- tachments being loose, unless when they have been irritated by accident or maltreatment. When sar-

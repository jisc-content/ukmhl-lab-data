GANGLIA. 319 often attains considerable size. The fluid is colour- less and glairy, mixed with small cartilaginous bodies of a flattened form, and the size of mustard seeds, or split peas. The swelling sometimes extends under the annular ligament, and under the fascia of the forearm. Motion of the parts is seriously re- tarded. Accumulation of the fluid is not prevented by any means. Puncture has been practised successfully in several instances, in others a good deal of inflamma- tory action followed. On the escape of the fluid, the motions of the parts are regained.

Some- times they occur, small, on the sides of the fingers. At first they are attended with pain, afterwards with inconvenience only. The swelling is usually globu- lar ; but when large, as on the back of the wrist, the form is rendered irregular by the pressure of the tendons.

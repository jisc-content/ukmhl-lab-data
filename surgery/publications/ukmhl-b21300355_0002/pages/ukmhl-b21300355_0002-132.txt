DISEASES OF THE EYE. 122 of the eye, as with amaurosis. But in amaurosis, opacity, when it exists, is deep, concave, greenish, or of a metallic appearance ; whereas, in cataract, it is of a more or less white colour, convex, and situate immediately behind the pupil. Cataract may be lenticular, the lens being opaque whilst its capsule remains transparent. In such a case, the disease is slow in its progress, and the opacity uniformly commences in the centre of the lens, and gradually extends to the circumference. The degree of opacity varies in different cases, from cloudy dimness to complete whiteness. In general the predominant hue is white or greyish, but not unfrequently the opacity is of several colours, and occasionally of a mottled appearance. The consist- ence also of lenticular cataract varies, being some- times fluid, occasionally extremely dense and almost osseous, but most frequently of caseous consistence. When fluid, the cataract is of larger size than the healthy lens ; when caseous, the part usually retains its former dimensions ; and when dense, the lens is often considerably diminished in size. The motions of the pupil are seldom, if ever, affected. Cataract may be capsular, the capsule being opaque, whilst the lens either remains free of disease, or has been removed by natural or artificial processes. The opacity in this case does not always commence in the centre, but frequently begins at the margin, and is of a spotted or mottled appearance, and in general not uniformly opaque.

74 DISEASES OF THE EYE. should be introduced every evening ; this causes little or no inconvenience to the patient, and ensures the permeability of the canal. Such is the method which will obtain a permanent cure, and which, in my opinion, is preferable to the use of tubes. If these are to be employed, they should, as already mentioned, be of equal calibre throughout, and not gradually diminishing towards their lower extremity ; the external opening must not be allowed to close for a considerable time after the introduction of the instrument; and the tube must be kept pervious for some time by a style introduced through it. But by these means, which are essential for the success of the practice, the main advantage of the use of a tube, viz. little irritation being produced at first, and the parts being allowed to close soon over it, are com- pletely done away with. The practice of perforating the os unguis never can be required ; it is cruel, unnecessary, and unsurgical. Sometimes the lachrymal passages are entirely de- stroyed. In such cases, it has been found that no in- convenience arises from obliteration, as the lachrymal gland ceases, in a great measure to secrete fluid, and the conjunctival secretion, after having performed its office, evaporates from the surface. In truth, the lachrymal gland always enjoys long periods of repose, and is only called into active exercise of its functions occasionally, as the eye in its ordinary condition is sufficiently lubricated by secretion from its conjunc- tival covering.

264 TRACHEOTOME'. keeping of the passage clear, the inner one being occasionally withdrawn, cleaned, and replaced. But this is not necessary. The frequent introduction of a feather, or probe, is sufficient for some hours after the operation, and in a very short time the patient finds that he breathes freely, though the tube is re- moved for a few minutes, in order to be cleaned. At first, a funnel-shaped tube is used, to compress the edges of the wound and prevent oozing, as already mentioned ; afterwards, one of uniform calibre is more easily coughed through. The patient should be kept in an atmosphere of warm and equal tempera- ture, and it is also prudent to place some cloth of very loose texture over the tube, that the temperature of the respired air may resemble as much as possible that passing through the whole track of the windpipe ; thus bronchitis may be averted. In some cases, the necessity for continuing the tube speedily goes off, the larynx, in consequence of rest, having recovered its healthy state and action. After eight or ten days, on taking out the tube, and closing the aperture inthe trachea, the patient breathes and speaks well, and continues to do so. In other instances, the difficult breathing recurs soon after withdrawal of the tube, the morbid state of the laryngeal mucous membrane having not been wholly removed. In such circumstances, the tube must be replaced and continued, but a smaller one suffices, less mucus is secreted, and a considerable quantity of air passes through the larynx ; in short, the patient requires merely a small tube to obviate the

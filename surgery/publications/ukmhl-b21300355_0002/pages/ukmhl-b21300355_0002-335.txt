VENESECTION. 325 and the instrument prevented from transfixing the vein. The branch chosen should also be fixed ; one which rolls under the finger is pierced with difficulty. The vessel is fixed by the thumb of one hand placed immediately abofee; the point to be punctured, whilst the lancet is held loosely betwixt the thumb and fore- finger of the other ; and the surgeon should by prac- tice acquire the use of either hand for this and other minor operations, being thereby saved much trouble and awkwardness. The right hand is used for the left arm of the patient, the left for the righl. The lancet should be in very good order, not too spear- pointed, firm and with a keen edge. The blade, pla- ced at right angles with the handle, and held lightly, as above mentioned, is entered perpendicularly to the vessel. The puncture is made deep enough to pene- trate the vein, and then the edge is carried forward more than the point, that the opening in the inte- guments may be more free than that in the vein. The most convenient line of incision is obliquely across. The pressure of the thumb is relaxed when- ever a utensil is conveniently placed for the reception of the blood; and the arm is kept in the same posi- tion as during incision, that the openings in the integument and vein may correspond. Unless this be attended to, the skin will overlap the puncture in the vessel, and thus the stream will be completely obstructed, or at least the blood will not come away so smartly as at first. The blood may also cease to flow quickly from over tightness of the ligature, and from threatening of syncope; in the former case the

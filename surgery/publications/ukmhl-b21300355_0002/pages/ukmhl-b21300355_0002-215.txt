205 ULCERS OF THE TONGUE. In many cases the induration precedes ulceration, in others follows it. Sooner or later the absorbents are affected, becoming swollen, painful, and hard; and, as in malignant affections of other parts, the disposition and action is not limited to those in the immediate neighbourhood of the primary disease. The tongue is subject to simple induration, which is totally uncon- nected with malignant disposition, and subsides on improvement of the digestive organs; occasionally repeated leeching of the part accelerates the cure. Enough has already been said about removing the local irritating cause, when such can be discover- ed ; and the maxim, though most important, need not be formally repeated in regard to affections of the tongue. The simple ulcer heals under the usual applications to sores on mucous surfaces, whilst the general health is at the same time attended to. For malignant, nothing but removal of the part can avail. But this is not always either advisable or practicable : the disease may have involved the organ too extensively, and the lymphatics may have too widely participated in the action. When the disea- sed part is small, and nothing contraindicates surgi- cal interference, it may be removed by the bistoury ; usually the bleeding is very slight, but if trouble- some it is easily arrested by the cautery. When the disease is extensive, ligatures are to be employed. During the process a vulsellum is useful for grasping the morbid part, and securing the organ. The liga- tures should be strong, and are introduced by needles in fixed handles. They may either be passed at once,

154 POLYPUS OF THE NOSE. consistence, attended with extensive change in the structure of the membrane, and softening of the bones and cartilages, grow very rapidly, fill the cavities, and expand them. They show themselves on the face, through the nostrils—protrude through the floor of the orbit—get into the mouth behind the palate, through the tuberous processes of the superior maxillary bone—or project through the alveolar processes. The discharge from them is profuse and foetid, and in some cases blood flows in no small quantity. Such growths usually commence in one or other of the sinuses connected with the cavity of the nose—sometimes, though rarely, in the frontal sinus. When seated in the antrum maxillare, pain is experienced in the cheek for a short time, before swelling occurs. Soon the part enlarges, its cover- ings are thickened, the bony cavity expands, and the patient's sufferings are excruciating. The teeth loosen, and sanious matter is discharged from their roots. The tumour extends into the nostril, and soon runs the course already mentioned. Malignant disease sometimes, though rarely, commences in the anterior cavity of the nostril. No satisfactory cause can be assigned for the ap- pearance of either the benign or malignant form of polypus. The nostrils can be readily cleared of benign polypi, but seldom completely by one operation : in several cases, wherein only one or two tumours obstructed the cavities, I have had no occasion to repeat my in- terference.

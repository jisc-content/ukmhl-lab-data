95 DISEASES OF THE EYE. either lymph or pus is effused. Sometimes matter collects between the laminae, distends them, and, causing ulceration, discharges itself either into the anterior chamber or externally. Inflammation of the cornea arises frequently from lodgement of a foreign body in it: and ulcers of it are often produced by a similar cause. If the extraneous matter is not re- moved soon after its insertion, nature commences her endeavours to detach it, and the process employed is ulceration. Sometimes, however, a sac is formed around the foreign body as in other parts, and no ulcer is produced. Ulceration of the cornea also takes place in or- der to afford an exit to matter formed between its layers deeply or superficially. Deep abscess of the cornea is by no means a rare consequence of violent inflammatory action in the part. A minute opaque spot is at first seen ; this extends, assumes a yel- low colour, and does not change its situation on the head being moved. The internal lamellae may ulcer- ate in consequence of the pressure, but this seldom happens ; the matter is discharged externally. Sup- puration in this situation is attended with much pain. Abscess of the surface of the cornea is of more frequent occurrence than one more deeply seated ; from its external covering yielding readily to the pressure of the accumulating matter, it generally assumes a pustular form. The fluid in such cases is sometimes absorbed, and no vestige of disease remains in the part; but more frequently the apex of the

DISEASES OF THE EYE. 80 the outer layer of the cornea is beautifully demon- strated. Great inconvenience is caused by the state of ever- sion ; the surface of the eyeball is subject to inflam- mation, in consequence of being insufficiently protect- ed ; the change of its investing membrane is a serious evil; and in some cases the cornea becomes extensively ulcerated, unusually vascular, and opaque. When the conjunctiva only is in fault, the defor- mity is slight, and the state of matters is readily ameliorated by excision of the relaxed portion. This is done by sharp curved scissors ; as the wound gra- dually contracts, the eyelid is drawn inwards, and on cicatrization taking place, the parts have become restored to their healthy condition. Care, however, should be taken that too much of the swollen con- junctiva is not removed, otherwise the subsequent contraction may cause inversion of the lid. Com- bined with the above practice, relaxation of the lid itself will in many cases be remedied, by removal of a portion of it in the form of the letter V, by means of a sharp-pointed bistoury; the edges of the inci- sions are afterwards put together by a point of inter- rupted suture. When eversion arises from a cicatrix of the integuments, the part in fault may be divided ; but a temporary benefit only can be procured. For during the healing of the wound, the parts again con- tract, and though a portion of the conjunctiva is at the same time removed, the contraction internally will hardly counteract that which is going on exter- na lly.

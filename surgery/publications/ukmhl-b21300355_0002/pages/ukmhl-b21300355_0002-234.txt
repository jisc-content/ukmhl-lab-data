224 OSTEOSARCOMA OF THE JAW. the gums is deeply indented by the teeth of the upper jaw ; it separates the jaws to a greater or less extent, prevents closure of the lips, induces salivation, and impedes the taking of nourishment. The tumour is one of those which are apt to be reproduced, and if unmolested, gradually undermines the system, and ultimately destroys the patient miserably. At one time every instance of it was regarded as hopeless ; but of late a great many tumours, in various stages of advancement, have been removed successfully by British, Irish, and foreign surgeons. In some in- stances, the portion of the jaw containing the morbid growth has been sawn out; in others, one half of the bone, or more, has been removed by disarticula- tion, after being divided beyond the diseased part. The operation is severe, and to a spectator shocking, but can be undertaken with safety, and in most cases with almost a certainty of favourable termination. In no other way can the disease be eradicated. Par- tial excisions, applications of the cautery, &c. only hasten malignant advancement. To expose the tumour and admit of the bone be- ing readily divided, incision of the soft parts requires to be extensive. And previously to determining on the plan of operation, the extent of the disease must be ascertained accurately. If, for example, the tu- mour is included between the lateral incisor tooth and last molar on the same sideâ€”these teeth must be extracted to permit division at these points. A semilunar incision may then be made along the base of the jaw, the horns of the incision pointing upwards ft

266 PHARYNGITIS. than was formerly imagined ; yet it must be acknow- ledged that little benefit can be expected to follow such, or any treatment, in many cases of contraction of the canal, from long-continued disease. The introduction of tubes into the larynx, has been supposed likely to supersede bronchotomy in some cases ; and it is said that their presence does not pro- duce so much irritation as has been stated. But the practice must, in all cases, be most troublesome to the surgeon, and painful to the patient; and, in my opinion, continuance of it is in the great majority of cases impracticable. Besides, it is difficult, and not unattended with danger. Bronchotomy is quite safe, and not likely to be followed by such suffering to the patient, or by any other unpleasant consequence, to which the other method is liable. Pharyngitis.â€”Inflammation of the pharynx is of rare occurrence. The inflammation may extend from neighbouring parts, or be produced by the direct ap- plication of an irritating or stimulating cause, as the lodgement of foreign bodies, of pins, fish-bones, seeds, portions of hard food ; or by the application of acrid fluids to the membrane, acids, hot water, &c. In one instance which I met with, it occurred in a very violent form, in consequence of a large and sharp portion of an earthen Ware plate paving been swal- lowed by the patient whilst taking his porridge, and becoming firmly impacted in the lower part of the pharynx. I have seen a considerable number of in- stances in which the disease was produced by the

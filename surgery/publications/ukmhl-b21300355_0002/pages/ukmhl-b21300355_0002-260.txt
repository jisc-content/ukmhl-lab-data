DISEASES OF WINDPIPE. 250 of the windpipe, which, in children, is so rapid in its progress, and so prone to terminate in effusion of lymph, is not often met with in persons of an ad- vanced age. Inflammatory affections of the larynx and trachea are, however, by no means unfrequent in adults ; but are of a very different character, as to symptoms, progress, and termination, from that affec- tion which is strictly denominated croup. Pain is felt in the region of the windpipe, and is aggravated by pressure on the forepart of the neck, by speaking, and by deglutition ; expectoration is increased, and ultimately assumes a muco-purulent character. The voice is altered in tone and in strength, and occasion- ally there is complete aphonia. Frequently these symptoms, after having continued for a short time, gradually subside ; if not, the mucous membrane, particularly in the upper part of the larynx, becomes thickened and considerably softened in texture, with effusion of serous fluid in the subjacent cellular tis- sue, and apparently in the substance of the membrane itself. In consequence of such effusion, the difficulty of breathing is much increased. Occasionally lymph is effused on the surface of the membrane ; but this is comparatively of rare occurrence, and when it does take place, is generally confined to the upper part of the larynx. The effusion of serum is often abundant, causing protrusion of the mucous membrane, and narrowing of the canal; and when it is limited to the upper part of the larynx, as frequently happens, the disease

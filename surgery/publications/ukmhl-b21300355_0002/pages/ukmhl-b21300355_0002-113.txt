Exophthalmia, or protrusion of the eye, attends the preceding disease, and is also a consequence of various other morbid actions in the globe and its neighbourhood. Treatment of External Ophthalmia and its Con- sequences.â€”The exciting cause, if such exist and can be discovered, ought in the first place to be removed.

In examining the inner surfaces of the palpebral, it is necessary, to produce complete eversion, to bring the parts completely into view ; and the most convenient method of accomplishing this is to lay hold of the cilise between the finger and thumb, and reflect the lid over a silver probe placed along its base. This is the more necessary, as small particles of foreign matter lodge more frequently on the palpebral con- junctiva than on any other part.

INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 25 ed brain from extravasation. We possess no means of preventing the effusion, and though we did, the mischief has generally taken place before the patient can receive assistance. Again, the site of the extra- vasation can seldom be ascertained ; and, should that objection to the propriety of surgical interference not exist, still the coagulated blood cannot be eva- cuated even after extensive removal of the bone. If the coagulum is small, it may be gradually and wholly absorbed, or the brain may become accustom- ed to the pressure of what remains. It is the sur- geon's duty to take means for averting inflammatory action, and to subdue or moderate it when it has been excited. The symptoms arising from displaced bone may be relieved by surgical operation; but we must premise some observations on fracture, before speaking of the treatment necessary in such cases. At an early period of life the bones are soft and elastic ; they yield readily under external violence, and it requires a great and direct force to produce fracture of them. Late in life, when the diploe dis- appears, the external and internal tables come in contact; the bone is brittle, and solution of conti- nuity in it is easily effected. And it is wisely so arranged, for thus in the recklessness of childhood and youth, severe blows on the cranium, which are- then of so frequent occurrence, are seldom attended or followed with danger ; whilst the aged are taught by experience to avoid the unfortunate consequences so apt to result from even a slight blow on the then

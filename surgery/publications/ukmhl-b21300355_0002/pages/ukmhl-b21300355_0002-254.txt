The callous edges of the wound were removed by incision, and the opening closed by suture. The tube was removed on the tenth day thereafter, and the patient breathed well. Soon, however, respira- tion became difficult, and tracheotomy (below the isthmus of the thyroid) was performed. A silver tube was introduced, and retained for five days, when it was replaced by a smaller one. After twenty days, the tube was removed altogether, and in a short time afterwards the wound closed completely. The patient continued to breathe with ease through the larynx, and slowly recovered her voice. When agi- tated, or after sudden and violent exertion, her in- spirations are a little longer than natural, but in other respects the cure is complete. Laryngitis, cynanche trachealis, most frequently occurs in children, and in them it is termed croup; but it also, though rarely, attacks adults. The voice is brazen, hoarse, and croaking ; the cough is bark- ing, and the countenance suffused. Inspiration is long, painful, effected with much difficulty, and at- tended with a wheezing or rattling noise. Expira- tion, on the contrary, is easy.

PARONYCHIA. 310 solidation of the parts immediately around, having been accomplished by the effusion and organization of lymph. When this method fails—and when the case is more advanced, with pain, swelling, and abscess— weakening of the circulation in the part is found to be effectual. The main artery is to be obstructed at a distance from the wounded part. It is needless to tie the radial, or the ulnar, or both ; for still blood will be poured in by the interosseous and its anas- tomoses. The humeral must be secured in the mid- dle of the arm, as has been practised in many instances, and with uniform success. Thus the bleeding is ar- rested until the wounded vessel recovers, and becomes permanently closed by salutary effusion ; then the inflammatory action, and its consequences, in the surrounding parts, must be treated on the general principles of surgery. Paronychia, or Whitlow, designates inflammatory action and its consequences, in the structures compo- sing the fingers. The mere surface may be the seat of the inflammation, or the cellular tissue, or the fibrous structure betwixt that and the sheath of the tendons ; or the firm and true sheath of the tendons, and the synovial surface ; or the investing membrane of the bone, the bone itself, and the articulating sur- faces and apparatus. The inflammatory action may commence in any of these structures, but, if uncon- trolled, ultimately involves the greater number, or all. The deeper seated the action, the more violent are the symptoms, and the danger to the member greater. In the cutis vera of the fingers, there is a

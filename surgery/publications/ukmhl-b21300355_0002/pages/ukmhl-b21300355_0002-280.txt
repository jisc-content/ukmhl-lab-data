270 STllICTUltE OF GULLET. with malignant disposition or action, is completely in the power of the surgeon. After sufficient time has been allowed for the irritation following the first in- troduction to subside, a larger bougie is to be passed, and retained as long as its presence can be endured. This practice must be continued, till, by gradual increase of the bougie, the canal is dilated so as to admit readily an instrument sufficient to distend the gullet in its healthy state. Thus the passage will be gently and gradually dilated, till it regain its original calibre. The process is partly mechanical, but also greatly dependent on vital action ; by the presence of the bougie the parts are stimulated, the fluid, which may be effused beneath the mucous membrane or into its substance, is absorbed, and the new solid matter is also gradually removed by increased action of the absorbents. But if the bougie be rudely and forcibly introduced, or too long retained, the absorbent action from being salutary becomes morbid, and ulceration is established, which may proceed to destroy the parietes of the canal, so producing an additional and equally formidable disease ; or if the ulcerative action subside, the parts will cicatrise and consequently con- tract, so giving rise to a new stricture, and narrow- ing the canal to an equal or greater extent than for- merly. Before introducing the bougie, the head must be thrown as far back as possible, and brought to a horizontal position, that the natural curve of the upper part of the canal may be lessened, and the passage of the instrument thus facilitated. It is of consequence also to keep the point of the bougie

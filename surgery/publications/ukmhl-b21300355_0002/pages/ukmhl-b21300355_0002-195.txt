185 FORMATION OF NEW LIP. made to bring the parts together after excision; great deformity, and almost total closure of the mouth, would be the consequence. The diseased parts must be freely removed (for this is the primary and essen- tial part of the operation, all other considerations yielding to it,) and the deformity will prove much slighter than might be supposed ; granulations arise, and considerable reparation of the lost parts thence ensues. Still there is a risk of the sore, at first healthy and active, gradually assuming the nature of that for which the incisions were made. It may be necessary to remove the whole lip, or the greater part of it. Hence arises much inconve- nience to the patient; he is much reduced by the profuse secretion and loss of saliva; the surround- ing parts are excoriated and irritable ; his clothes are wetted ; his speech is very indistinct; his teeth become thickly coated with tartar; and he is in short kept in a state of constant annoyance. The part may be supplied from under the chin ; but this repa- rative operation should not be performed at the same time with removal of the original and carcinomatous lip. By making two operations, with a considerable time intervening, the chance of success is greater, and indeed the labour is diminished. After removal of the disease, allow the parts to fill up by granulation and contraction as far as they will, and then form a new lip. I have done so in several instances ; in one case, the parts had perished by external violence, in another, they had been destroyed by some powerful escharotic. A piece of leather, of the size and shape of the under lip, is placed under the chin, and a cor-

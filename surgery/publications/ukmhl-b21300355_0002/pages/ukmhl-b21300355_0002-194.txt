184 ULCEUS OF THE LIPS. sion is preferable, on account of the diseased portion being chiefly in the prolabium, and the parts after- wards coming together very neatly and readily. The lip is stretched by the operator and his assistant laying hold of the prolabium on each side of the por- tion destined to be taken away ; a narrow straight bistoury is passed through the lip, at the angle of the form of incision, and the operator, standing in front of the patient, makes the first incision towards himself, by bringing the knife up to the prolabium. He then takes hold of the part to be removed, and laying the edge of the knife on the prolabium at the other side of the induration, cuts down to the point where the instrument originally entered. The inci- sions must always be made far from the indurated parts. The edges of the wound are retained in ap- position by means of convoluted suture, as formerly described. When the wound is extensive, as when a considerable part of the cheek is involved, approxi- mation may be accomplished by a few points of in- terrupted suture, and afterwards the parts may be more securely and accurately fixed by convoluted sutures placed between the interrupted. When a large portion of the cheek is removed, as for disease which had commenced at the angle of the mouth and extended around, all the parts cannot be brought in- to contact, and some of the deficiency remains to be filled up by granulation. The neighbouring parts stretch, and the deformity that may be the immediate result of the operation, in a great measure disappears after some time. In cases of superficial and malig- nant ulceration of great extent, no attempt can be

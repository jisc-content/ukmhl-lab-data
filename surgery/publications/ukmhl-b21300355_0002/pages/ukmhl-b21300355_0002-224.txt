TUMOURS OF THE GUMS. 214 ous swelling ensued, the mouth was rapidly filled, and the system alarmingly shaken ; after all the dis- ease was not eradicated. Tumours beneath the tongue, however origina- ting, occasionally inflame, and become the seat of unhealthy abscess. A large and painful swelling forms, and projects under the chin. The matter gradually approaches the surface, and perhaps eva- cuates itself imperfectly into the mouth, or the in- teguments give way, and afford an external issue. In such cases, an early incision from the mouth may prevent the internal mischief, and the disfiguration of the countenance which would otherwise ensueâ€” may, in short, limit the suppuration; afterwards a free opening is to be made below the chin, in the mesial line, and in the direction of the muscular fibres. A ready drain is thus obtained for the mat- ter, and the cavity of the abscess gradually contracts. Tumours of the Gums are usually hard, and not inclined to increase rapidly. They are of the same consistence as the parts to which they are attached, and grow either inwardly, outwardly, or both. They surround one or more teeth, which at last become loose, and the alveolar processes soften, and form part of the swelling. These may degenerate, and grow rapidly, or the tumour may be soft (tumor mali moris) from the first. The attention of the patient is directed to the part by the occurrence of discharge from about the teeth, which loosen one after another. A soft tu- mour arises from the sockets after cither extrusion

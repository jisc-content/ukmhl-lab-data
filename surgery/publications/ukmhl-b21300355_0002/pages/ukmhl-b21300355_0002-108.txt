DISEASES OF THE EYE. 98 being protected by mucous membrane and mucous discharge; even the contact of the tears irritates, and keeps up inflammatory action in the membranes. When the ulcerative process ceases, lymph is effused, and a greyish halo forms around the sore; the ash colour of the surface of the sore disappears, and is succeeded by florid granulations, extremely minute, which fill up the cavity : cicatrization follows in due time, with subsidence of all the symptoms and ap- pearances of inflammation. There remains, however, an opaque speck of a pearly hue corresponding to the sore, but occupying rather less space. When the cornea is perforated by ulceration, the sore some- times shows no disposition to heal, becoming a fistu- lous aperture through which the aqueous humour is from time to time discharged : by this condition of parts vision is much impaired, the cornea being al- ways more or less flaccid. The pearly speck which remains after cicatrization of a corneal sore is termed Leacoma, and is per- manent. It is generally of an uniform colour, but occasionally a black speck is perceptible in some part of it. For when an ulcer lays open the anterior chamber, part or the whole of the aqueous humour is evacuated, and the iris falls forward ; and a por- tion of the iris falling into the opening, provided this is not in the centre of the cornea, closes it up, and becomes adherent to that part. If the opening is large, the prolapsus of the iris is considerable; and in some cases, this membrane, being pressed on by the humours, is forced through the opening in

ganglia. 320 the lower ranks ; in them the structure of the limbs is more delicate than in males, and they are often obliged to use great exertions with the upper extre- mities before the growth of the body is completed. Friction is of no use. Continued pressure on the swelling, by coins or small pieces of lead bound down for weeks or months, is very seldom followed by cure. If ,the tumour is placed over a bone, sudden and firm compression should be made with the thumb, so as to rupture the cyst, or with the same view it may be struck sharply by an obtuse body. The con- tents are thus extravasated into the cellular tissue, and are speedily absorbed; the cyst inflames, and becomes obliterated. Sometimes the excitement is insufficient for complete closure of the cyst, and the swelling returns; but this is rare. When the cyst is thick, the tumour of long duration, and the person impatient of pain, it may be punctured by a cataract needle of any kind; one thin and double-edged is probably the most convenient. The instrument is introduced through the skin, at some distance from the swelling, and by moving the point of the needle after penetration, the cyst is divided freely. The needle is withdrawn, and the orifice closed by the finger. The contents are then squeezed into the cellular tissue, and this is followed by the same fa- vourable results as in the preceding method. Re- moval of such tumours by dissection is unnecessary, and also attended with risk. I have removed seve- ral large ones by incision ; but the whole cyst can- not be taken away, and there is great risk of inflam- 5

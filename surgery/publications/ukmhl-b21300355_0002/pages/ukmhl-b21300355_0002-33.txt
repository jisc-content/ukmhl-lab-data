Weakness of the right arm and of the inferior extremity suddenly supervened, and the patient gradually sunk. On examination after death, the cervical portion of the spinal cord was found much softened, with infil- tration of purulent matter into its substance. The deficiency in the cranium was supplied by a firm ligamentous expansion, to which the dura mater and scalp adhered firmly. Of Compression of the Brain.â€”Compression is produced by extravasation within the cranium of blood or other fluid, by the lodgement of a foreign body on the surface of the brain, or in its substance, or by displacement inwards of portions of the cranial bones ; and these causes are usually the effects of external injury. It may either follow the injury instantaneously, or supervene some time thereafter.

101 DISEASES OF THE EYE. affection, however, is rare. I have seen several in- stances of it: in one, both corneas were spotted, and sight was almost destroyed, without much irritability of the organ. The disease yielded to external sti- mulants, and the internal use of the muriate of mer- cury The cornea may sometimes be rendered dim by overdistension, the aqueous humour being unusually copious Occasionally sloughing takes place in the cornea from overaction. It is dangerous to the structure and functions of the organ, according to the extent to which it occurs. Ossification of the cornea is said to take place, but few cases are on record, and these were in very old people. The cornea sometimes becomes conical to a great degree in persons considerably advanced in life. The cone has its apex in the centre of the organ, seems thick and crystalline when viewed laterally, and when looked on from the front has a sparkling ap- pearance. In some cases it is opaque in the centre, and occasionally its surface is irregular. Vision of objects at any distance is very indistinct; those placed within an inch or two of the eye are most distinctly seen, especially if looked on through a small aperture. The disease usually affects both eyes. The patients cannot judge accurately of distance, and see objects multiplied and disfigured. Staphyloma has been already alluded to as an occa- sional consequence of purulent ophthalmia in children.

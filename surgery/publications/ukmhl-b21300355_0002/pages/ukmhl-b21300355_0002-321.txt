311 PARONYCHIA. plentiful distribution of nerves of sensation ; and, consequently, in superficial whitlow, the pain is often severe, with throbbing, and an occasional feeling of itching. The part is swelled and red, and the red- ness is diffused. After short continuance, the swell- ing increases at some points, often about the root of the nail, from effused fluid betwixt the cuticle and rete mucosurn; the fluid is sometimes serous, gene- rally sero-purulent. In the deeper-seated inflamma- tion, the pain, throbbing, heat, and swelling, are all greater. The pain is most intense and almost into- lerable, allowing the patient little or no rest; and the throbbing extends to the vessels of the hand and fore- arm. A considerable degree of fever attends. The action either involves one phalanx, or extends over the whole fingers, and ultimately attacks the hand. The palm is hard, pained, and swelled ; and, in ad- vanced cases, swelling takes place above the annular ligament. Often the surface of the back of the hand is also inflamed, and the cellular tissue loaded with serum. The disease, if not actively and properly treated, terminates in a very short time; in two or three days suppuration takes place, with sloughing of the cellular tissue, of the sheaths of the tendons, and of the tendons themselves. Either ulceration or necrosis—often both in combination—occurs in the phalanges; or the apparatus of one or more of the articulations is destroyed. Abscesses also form in the palm, on the back of the hand and finger, and sometimes under the fascia of the forearm. The separation of portions of one of the tendons is not always followed by loss of motion in the finger;

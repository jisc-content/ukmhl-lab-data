It is seldom that the puncta are obstructed, and consequently the swelling does not attain any great size, the sac being relieved by some of its contents always flowing upwards, after a cer- tain degree of distension. As the inflammation far- ther subsides, the mucous secretion diminishes, and the accumulation and swelling are less : in fact, the patient may at this period prevent a tumour from forming in the corner of his eye, by from time to time pressing gently on the sac, and forcing the lachrymal secretion upwards, as it begins to accu- mulate. This state of matters may continue for a long period, without causing much inconvenience, and getting neither better nor worse ; the patient is merely obliged to apply his finger and handkerchief more frequently to his eye than would otherwise be required. In almost all cases, the obstruction of the nasal duct is complete, or nearly so, and consequently the fluid cannot pass downwards into the nose, though it may occasionally appear to do so, on ac- count of the discharge from the schneiderian mem- brane being increased at the same time with that of the lachrymal sac. The ductus ad narem, though wide in the skeleton, is naturally of very limited di- mensions, and is in consequence readily made imper- meable to mucous fluid, by even slight thickening of its lining membrane. It has been already observed that the above-men-

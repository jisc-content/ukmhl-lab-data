DISEASES OF THE EYE. 99 the form of a small bag. This change of position is termed Hernia of the Iris, and the dark sacculated portion of the iris which projects from the surface of the cornea is called Myocephalon, from its resemblance to the head of a fly. The myocephalon may remain for a considerable time, or may sphacelate and drop away. The pupil is thus rendered irregular, is per- haps nearly obliterated, or is drawn down behind the opaque part, and thereby rendered totally useless to the patient. The impairment of vision caused by Leucoma depends on the size and situation of the speck. The disease is irremediable, though the thin cloudy opacity, which frequently surrounds the leu- coma, may be dissipated. The operation of artificial pupil is sometimes required in order to afford a de- gree of vision in this affection of the cornea,â€”as well as in the speck of a similar appearance occasioned by effusion and organization of lymph betwixt the deep lamellae of the cornea, and which is termed Albugo. Albugo occurs during the intensity of inflamma- tory attacks. It also is surrounded occasionally by thinner opacity, but not depressed and unequal on the surface as leucoma sometimes is. Large and tortuous vessels are generally seen passing into albu- gines, but meshes of dilated vessels are seldom present. When the affection is recent, it sometimes disappears under proper treatment, especially in young subjects ; but the albugo is by no means so readily removed as the Nebula, or thin cloudy opacity which is the fre- quent consequence of obstinate chronic dilatation of the conjunctival vessels. Nebula is superficial, and

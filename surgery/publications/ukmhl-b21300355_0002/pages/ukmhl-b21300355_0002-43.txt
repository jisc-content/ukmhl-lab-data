33 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. The vessels were unusually numerous and highly en- gorged, and lymph and pus were effused in consider- able quantity, the arachnoid was opaque, and the cere- bral substance was somewhat softened. Had the operation been performed at an earlier period, there is every probability that the inflammation, which proved fatal, would have been averted, as in the fol- lowing instance:—A quarryman received a blow from a sharp stone of considerable size, which rolled down a precipitous bank, and struck him on the vertex. He lay insensible for half an hour, but recovered, and followed his occupation during the rest of the day. In the evening he came for advice. There was a small wound in the scalp, and the subjacent bone was fractured in the same manner as in the former instance, but he felt no uneasy symptoms whatever. The consequences likely to result from such an injury, and the necessity for trephining, were represented to him; he agreed, and the operation was performed on the spot. Many sharp fragments of the inner table were extracted ; he proceeded home, never had a bad symptom afterwards, and consequently required no treatment save dressing of the wound. The operation, if undertaken early, will, in all probability, succeed in averting future evil, more especially if the dura mater be not wounded. As a proof of the unfavourable nature of this latter cir- cumstance, I give the following case :—A young man, aged 18, received a kick on the forehead from a horse, September 9th. He remained perfectly sensible, and did not fall to the ground. Shortly after, he was PART II. c

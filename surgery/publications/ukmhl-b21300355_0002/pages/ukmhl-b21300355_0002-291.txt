AFFECTIONS OF EAli. 281 times slightly lobulated and warty-looking ; it ad- heres by a narrow neck to the parietes of the tube near the margin of the membrana tympani, is attend- ed with slight discharge, and with deafness to a greater or less extent. Extraction is the only means of cure. The body of the tumour is depressed and pulled outwards by the flat end of a probe slightly bent; delicate forceps are introduced gently, and passed up to the neck of the polypus, which is then firmly grasped ; by com- bining slight twisting with gentle extractive force, it is readily removed. Or a flat scoop, with a sharp round edge, is passed along till obstructed, and by slight rotatory motion of the edge, the neck of the tumour is divided. After a day or two, a mild escha- rotic may be applied with the view of preventing reproduction ; a bit of charpie sprinkled with the oxidum hydrargyri rubrum may be pushed up to where the tumour was attached, and the application may be repeated several times, one or two days inter- vening. Even after this the tumour sometimes re- turns, again rendering extraction necessary. Deafness is attributable to various causes besides those already mentioned. Accumulation of cerumen in the external meatus is the most common. The cerumen is often mixed with wool, and other extra- neous substances, which the patient may have been in the habit of introducing as preservatives from cold, and thus a large and firm plug is formed, com- pletely blocking the meatus. It is removable by the assiduous injection of tepid water, the best solvent of

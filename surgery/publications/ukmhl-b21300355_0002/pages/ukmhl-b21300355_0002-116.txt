The eye is more valuable to a great proportion of people than a limb ; and the surgeon is very culpa- ble if not master of this part of his profession, and able to undertake the management of every disease and accident to which the eye is liable. " In all cases of inflammation the general treatment is the same ; but each variety requires peculiar attention during the cure depending on the structure and function of the tissue affected." In the first stage of external ophthalmia, active antiphlogistic measures must be put in force. In full habits, and cases of intense action, general bleeding must be employed, even to deliquium, from the veins of the arm or of the neck, or from the temporal artery,â€”and repeated, if necessary, according to circumstances. Blood is sometimes abstracted by cupping from the temples or the nape of the neck; but it is a painful and uncertain mode of emptying the vessels. Local bloodletting, in many cases, suf- fices to moderate the action ; in all it is most bene- ficial and important, after the employment of general depletion. The application of leeches to the inner canthus, is the most effectual method of abstracting blood locally, as at that point the venous return is made from the eye ; if placed on the temples they can produce very little benefit; if on the outer sur- face of the eyelids, ecchymosis follows, on account of the extreme looseness of the cellular tissue in that situation. Or the angular vein, at the inner canthus, may be opened with a lancet, and a considerable quantity of blood thereby abstracted from the seat of

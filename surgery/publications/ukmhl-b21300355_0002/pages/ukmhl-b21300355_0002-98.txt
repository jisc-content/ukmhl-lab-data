Not unfrequently conjunctivitis is a secondary affection, accompanying eruptile diseases, as measles or smallpox. In considering the disease, it is necessary to keep in mind the loose connexion of the membrane with the subjacent parts, as well as its own texture and functions. In conjunctival inflammation, the patient first feels a degree of pain and stiffness in moving the organ; and has always a feeling as if a foreign body were present, whether such is the case or not. There is also a degree of itching with a sensation of fulness in the part, and this is followed by redness of the membrane, becoming more and more intense. If the disease gain ground, the colour changes to a darkish- brown or bluish hue. To the redness succeeds heat, with profuse and hot lachrymation. Then swelling supervenes, often to a great extent: the vessels, both veins and arteries, are much gorged, and effusion of serum or blood takes place into the loose cellular tis- sue which connects the conjunctiva to the sclerotic. In some cases, the effusion in this situation is very considerable; lymph as well as blood is deposited, and a bulging forwards of the conjunctiva is produced : the stretched membrane becomes thickened, of a raw granulated appearance, and a bright scarlet hue, and

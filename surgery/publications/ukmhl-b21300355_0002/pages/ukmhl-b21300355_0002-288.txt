AFFECTIONS OF EAR. 278 suspicion of hydrocephalus being established. The symptoms are all much relieved on the occurrence of copious purulent discharge. Suppuration in the organ of hearing often follows eruptive diseases ; and both ears, or one, may con- tinue to discharge for a long time. There is always more or less derangement of the functions of the parts. When the disease is external, perhaps hear- ing may not be much affected ; but when, as often happens, the ossicnla, nervous expansions, membrane, parietes, are all destroyed or injured, hearing is lost, or at least very obtuse. Purulent discharge often continues for the rest of the patient's life, at one time scanty, at another profuse, and preceded or accom- panied by inflammatory symptoms. Openings form over the mastoid process, communicating with the cells; and these are often connected with abscess be- twixt the dura mater and pars petrosa of the tempo- ral bone. Abscesses, too, of the middle lobe of the cerebrum, or in the cerebellum, are sometimes eva- cuated through the meatus auditorius. In all cases, but in the last more particularly, the patient suffers extremely on the discharge being suppressed, and is again relieved on its recurrence. At length, fever and delirium may supervene, terminating in coma and death ; I have dissected many who have perished in this manner. Or, after long continued discharge from the meatus, perhaps with paralysis of one side of the face, a soft tumour of the dura mater will be found lying over tlie pars petrosa, having caused extensive absorption of the bone, and exposed the semicircular canals, cochlea, tympanum, &c. filled

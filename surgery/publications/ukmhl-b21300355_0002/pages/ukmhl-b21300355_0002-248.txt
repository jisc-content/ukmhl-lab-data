WOUNDS OF NECK. 238 In other cases, death is more slow. The patient is seized with dyspnoea, great anxiety, and occasional spasmodic action of the muscles of respiration, which symptoms gradually become more urgent and alarm- ing. They are attributable to awkward position of the parts, to swelling around the wound, inflamma- tory or oedematous and rapid or slow, or to bronchi- tis. To the latter affection patients breathing through artificial openings in the larynx or trachea are pecu- liarly subject, probably from the inspired air not being heated, as in natural respiration, before it enters the bronchial tubes. The bleeding is to be arrested as speedily as pos- sible by ligature, and the patient placed in bed with the head and shoulders raised. The edges of the wound are brought together by attention to the position of the head; but, provided the patient breathes easily with the wound open, closure should not be attempted till after eight, ten, or twelve hoursâ€”that is, not until all oozing of blood has ceased ; the time depends on the extent to which the air-tube has been divided. There is little chance of immediate union taking place ; and the wound not being approximated when recent and bleeding, does not diminish the chance, but on the contrary aug- ments it. Adhesion is prevented by the insinuation of air and mucus betwixt the edges, by frequent motion of the edges on each other, by the slightest change in the position of the head, either rotatory or nodding, by the action of the muscles of the os hyoitles, and by attempting to swallow food or saliva.

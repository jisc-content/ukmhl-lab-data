135 DISEASES OF THE EYE. pointed narrow knife, or with probe-pointed scissors. Division of the capsule by the point of the knife during transfixion has been practised ; but it is an unsafe, though dexterous, measure. In opening the capsule care should be taken not to separate its at- tachments, otherwise it will become opaque, and there- by passage of light to the bottom of the eye will be again obstructed. Neither should much pressure be used for extrusion of the lens; for in the case of a large and firm cataract, the iris may be lacerated, and the humours escape. When any of the vitreous humour has escaped in consequence of its cells ha- ving been broken down, and its tenacity diminished, the eye soon fills again, but good vision is hardly to be exjjected. After the operation, applications to the eye should be very light; a rag dipped in cold water, and renew- ed occasionally, is sufficient. All stimulants of the organ, as light, should be avoided, and antiphlogistic treatment adopted. Should violent pain supervene, bleeding, both local and general, and other means for subduing inflammatory action, must be had recourse to. The eyelids should not be raised or exposed for at least three days, unless in extraordinary circum- stances. Belladonna is of use when gradual contrac- tion of the pupil occurs. In very favourable cases., vision is completely restored in the eye ; in others, the functions of the two eyes do not correspond, and vision is confused ; the patient requires to wear a con- vex glass before the one which has been operated on. The operation of making an artificial pupil is far

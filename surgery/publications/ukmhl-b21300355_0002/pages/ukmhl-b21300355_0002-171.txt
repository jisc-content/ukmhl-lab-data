161 DISEASE OF THE ANTRUM. lence of the haemorrhage is moderated by pressure on the carotids. After removal of the bone, the deep vessels, branches of the internal maxillary, are secured either by ligature, or by firm pressure with charpie or dossils of lint. The facial flap is replaced, brought together over the charpie by which the cavity is filled, and united by interrupted or convoluted suture. Cures by such proceedings, in such cases, are report- ed ; the patients do not always die immediately after the operation; but there is reason to complain of want of candour as regards the ultimate result. The disease, it is said, has been arrested by liga- ture of the common carotid; the allegation is not borne out by facts, nor is it easy to discover on what principle the practice was adopted. Such a result is not to be expected a 'priori, nor to be believed with- out farther trial; and these trials are not likely to be made. The antrum is liable to become the seat of other tumours beside the preceding. It may be occupied by osteosarcoma, commencing either there, or in the alveoli and extending upwards. The tumour feels hard, as if bony, is evidently circumscribed, and pre- sents the usual characters of osteosarcoma in other situations. It has not that disposition to involve neigh- bouring parts, hard as well as soft, but may remain long without extending farther than the superior max- illary bone, and occupying only a part of it. In such a case, excision of the maxillary bone is warrant- able, and ought certainly to be performed ; for when PART II. l

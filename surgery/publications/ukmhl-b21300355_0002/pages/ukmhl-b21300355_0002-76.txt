66 DISEASES OF THE EYE. give way by sloughing. A small ragged opening, often indirect, is formed, and the contents of the sac are not thereby all discharged; the thinner fluid only escaping, whilst the more viscid remains, and clogs the aperture. The swelling is not much di- minished ; the margins of the aperture thicken and become indurated, the purulent contents of the sac are gradually discharged, and tears afterwards flow through the opening. The parts are now in that condition to which the term Fistula lachrijmulis is with propriety applied. The swelling of the canal may gradually subside, and the tears resume their wonted course, and the opening may then contract, and the parts cicatrize ; but frequently the fistula remains open for a long period, gradually diminishing in diameter, and only a small passage, almost imper- ceptible, ultimately remaining, through which a few globules of lachrymal fluid are occasionally dischar- ged. Sometimes the fistula closes entirely without the obstruction of the nasal duct having been remo- ved, and the lachrymal sac remains in consequence distended ; then the tears or mucous, either clear or turbid, can generally be squeezed through the puncta. It frequently happens that the meibomian glands are the seat of morbid action, along with the lach- rymal passages; their secretion is changed, beco- ming in some cases thick and caseous, in others puriform. By some, affection of the meibomian glands has been considered as the cause of inflam- mation and abscess of the lachrymal sac. This opi- nion, however, cannot be agreed to, for the diseases

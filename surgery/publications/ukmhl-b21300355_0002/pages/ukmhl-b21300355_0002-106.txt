DISEASES OF THE EYE. 96 pustule gives way, and an ulcer is the consequence. A similar result takes place if an artificial opening is made for evacuation of the matter; and it may be considered as a good rule in practice not to interfere with collections in the cornea, as there is a probable chance of the matter being absorbed and the cornea regaining its transparency, while it is certain that breach of its surface in such cases, though made by the most delicate instrument, will give rise to ulcera- tion. Pustular Ophthalmia is at some seasons frequently met with : small pustules, sometimes numerous, form on the conjunctiva, whilst that membrane is turgid and its vessels dilated; the sclerotic conjunctiva around the cornea is their most common situation, but some- times almost the whole conjunctival surface appears studded with them. When the cornea is affected, the pustules frequently give way, and produce ulcer- ation ; and when the pustules are numerous and surrounded by much vascularity, the part becomes opaque as well as ulcerated. In weak constitutions ulcers of the cornea occur from slight causes,â€”ex- posure to strong light, intemperance, inverted or irregular ciliae, a granulated state of the lining of the lids, or from momentary irritation of the part by extraneous matter. The ulcer appears at first cir- cular, but during its progress it often becomes of an irregular form ; its surface is depressed and ragged, and can readily be seen by directing the patient to fix the eye, and then looking at the part from one side.

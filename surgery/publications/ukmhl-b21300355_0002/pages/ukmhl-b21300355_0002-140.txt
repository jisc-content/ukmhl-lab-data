130 DISEASES OF THE EYE. needle is then removed, its point should be carefully disentangled. The lens is said frequently to regain its usual situation, a considerable time after the operation; but in many such cases, the opacity in the pupil is not occasioned by the lens, but by the capsule having become opaque. It is said to have arisen, when very solid, twenty or thirty years after depres- sion ; and that in many cases no absorption of it oc- curs. When the vitreous humour has become disor- ganized, the lens often floats about, rising and falling with the motions of the head. In reclination, the point of the needle is placed on the upper and anterior surface of the lens, and by raising the handle and pushing the point slightly forward towards the inner part of the eye, the lens is removed from the axis of vision, placed inferior to it, and has the relative situation of its surfaces changed—its anterior surface becoming the upper ; and the posterior the under—the superior, posterior; and the inferior, anterior. Solid cataracts only can be depressed. When a cataract is fluid, it is sufficient to puncture, or lacerate slightly, the capsule ; as then the opaque contents will be diffused through the aqueous humour, and soon removed by the absorbents. Should the cap- sule become opaque, after the removal of its contents, the needle must be at a future period introduced; the capsule is to be lacerated and reduced to minute shreds, so that it may escape into the anterior cham- ber, and be absorbed. In the soft or caseous cata- ract, displacement is not easily effected ; and the

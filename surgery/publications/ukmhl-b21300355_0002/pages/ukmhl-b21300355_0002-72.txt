If it be discovered that the lachrymal sac is opened into, the same treat- ment is necessary as if it remained entire ; the matter is to be allowed free exit, and granulation encouraged; and, in most cases, the aperture in the sac is soon re- paired, and the parts heal as quickly and soundly as if the disease had been confined to the external cel- lular tissue. Light dressing during the cure, pre- ferable in all cases, is more especially necessary in this situation. Of Inflammation of the Lachrymal Sac.â€”When the lachrymal sac becomes inflamed, it enlarges considerably; the swelling is small, hard, circum- scribed, deeply seated, and extremely painful, more especially on pressure. At first the integuments are of their natural appearance, the increased action being confined to the sac, but they are soon involved, and often to a considerable extent; they become red and swollen, and as the surrounding parts are affected, the swelling increases. In some cases, the eyelids, the caruncle, and the conjunctival covering of the eye, participate in the inflammatory action. The in- flammation is in most instances caused, or at least preceded, by some obstruction in the nasal duct, in consequence of which, the tears are interrupted in their natural course downwards, and either accu-

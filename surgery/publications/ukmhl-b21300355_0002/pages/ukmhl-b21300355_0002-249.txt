Plasters and bandages are inapplicable, and un- warrantable from the interruption thereby caused to breathing and circulation : they likewise prevent the escape of mucus and air.

Many stitches also cannot be used without bad effects. The corners of an extensive wound may be kept together by points of suture ; and one may be placed at the middle, through the integuments only, to prevent overlapping or inversion of the edges. The head is placed in a comfortable position, inclined forwards, and secured by a bandage passed round the head, with its ends brought down and fixed to a band round the chest.

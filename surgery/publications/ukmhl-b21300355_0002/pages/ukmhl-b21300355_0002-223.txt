TUMOURS UNDER THE TONGUE. 213 by some mistaken for ranula; and I mention this circumstance, lest others may reckon more on the situation of a swelling, than on its feel and other external characters. Encysted tumours below the tongue are common. The cysts are generally thin and adherent, the con- tents albuminous and glairy. They attain a large size, and prove very inconvenient. Occasionally the cysts are thick and more loosely attached ; such usually contain atheromatous matter. I removed one uncommonly large, from the inner surface of which numerous hairs were growing. Encysted tumours here can seldom be removed by dissection ; the depth of their situation, their firm connexion, the awkward ituation in which the patient is necessarily placed, and the risk of haemor- rhage, forbid the surgeon from attempting regular extirpation. A more simple and equally effectual procedure is as follows :â€”The membrane of the mouth and the cyst are divided by the point of a bistoury; and if the tumour be large, and the dis- tention great, an oval portion of the parietes may be cut out. The contents are thus evacuated. The bleeding is allowed to cease, and, the cavity having been wiped out clean, a stick of caustic potass is applied to the surface, so as to annihilate the cyst effectually. This I believe to be the only radical and safe mode of removal; after any other, the tumour is certain to be reproduced. It has been recommended to pass a seton, so as to excite inflam- matory action, and lead to obliteration of the cyst. I have made trial of this practice, but most danger-

306 ACCIDENTS AT BEND OF ARM. bandaging; and a graduated compress, supplying the place of the thumb, is firmly applied, and must be re- tained for many days. Thus extravasation is effectu- ally prevented. But the measures must be adopted instantly, before any blood has escaped into the cel- lular tissue, and the apparatus must be well applied and retained. When pressure is required on any point, it is absolutely necessary to give support to the lower part of the limb, as was formerly insisted on ; and the proceeding is, if possible, more necessary in this case, the requisite pressure being very great. If ordinary compression only, sufficient to prevent the flow of blood through the opening in the integu- ments, is applied, blood is extravasated into the cel- lular tissue, breaking it up, and causing condensa- tion beyond; fluid blood accumulates in the space thus formed ; the surrounding cellular tissue is more and more condensed, at length constituting a firm sac, confining the fluid, and communicating with the opening in the artery; in fact, a pulsating and gra- dually increasing aneurism is established. Or, blood is effused betwixt the vein and the ar- tery, opposite the wounded points ; and a sac is formed, into which blood is propelled from the ar- tery, and which also communicates with the opening in the vein. This state of parts is denominated varicose aneurism ; it is very rare. Or, no extravasation takes place, and the artery and vein unite by lymph effused around the open- ings, the wounds remaining unclosed, and forming a permanent communication between the vessels. Thus, a portion of the arterial contents is constantly being

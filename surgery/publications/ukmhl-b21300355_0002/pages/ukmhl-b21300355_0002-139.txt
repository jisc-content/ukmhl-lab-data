DISEASES OF THE EYE. 129 wise, and not longer than from an inch to an inch and a quarter. Belladonna should be used in all cases, previously to determining upon operation, in order to ascertain the state of the humours, the size of the cataract, and whether adhesion of the iris to the. capsule of the lens exist or not. Dilatation so pro- duced is allowed to disappear almost entirely before the operation is proceeded in. It is sometimes ne- cessary to steady the eye by means of a speculum, and the wire one of Pellier is the best. By push- ing the needle, held like a writing pen, gently for- wards, and towards the inner canthus, in a direc- tion almost parallel with the iris, its point is seen in the posterior chamber, opposite the pupil. The in- strument is then fixed in the opaque lens, and the cataract is depressed obliquely downwards; the needle is disentangled by a gentle twisting motion, and then withdrawn in the same direction as it was entered. Before depressing, it is necessary to lacerate the cap- sule of the lens, and this is accomplished by giving the needle a rotatory motion, and moving its point in different directions ; the anterior portion of the vitre- ous humour is at the same time disturbed. Lacera- tion of the capsule may be too great, and allow the lens to escape entire into the anterior chamber; in- flammatory action is in consequence excited, and sub- sides only when an opening has been made in the cornea, and the offending body extracted. If the cata- ract rise to its original situation on withdrawing the needle, it should be again depressed, and kept down by the instrument for a short time ; and when the PART II. I

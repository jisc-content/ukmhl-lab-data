Punctured and lacerated wounds, more espe- cially those penetrating all the layers of covering, are frequently followed by violent and extensive in- flammation of all the tissues, with severe constitu- tional disturbance, and with delirium and other symptoms denoting functional derangement of the brain. The swelling is often extensive, involving the whole scalp, and the integuments of the face, and completely shutting the eyelids. In some cases resolution may be accomplished, but the most fre- quent termination is extensive infiltration of puru- lent matter into the cellular, or even into the more deep structures, with sloughing of the tendinous expansion. Collections of matter frequently form in the loose cellular tissue of the eyelids, whether the surrounding parts are affected with superficial or deeply-seated inflammation. As to treatment, after the infliction of an injury, the scalp ought to be shaved, and the wound cleansed of coagula and foreign substances. If a large flap of integument is detached, it should be replaced, and retained as nearly as possible in its natural situation; and if, for this latter purpose, slips of adhesive plas- ter and methodical compression prove insufficient, it will be necessary to employ a very few points of in- terrupted suture : these, however, must be removed at an early period, that is when either adhesion or suppuration has commenced, and ought, if possible, to be altogether dispensed with, being apt in this

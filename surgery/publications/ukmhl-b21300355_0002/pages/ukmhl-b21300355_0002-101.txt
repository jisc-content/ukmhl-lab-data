91 DISEASES OF THE EYE. humours are discharged; and the eye sinks with immediate relief to the patient from the more urgent symptoms, but at the same time with irreparable loss of vision. In other instances the effects are less injurious to the structure of the organ, but equally so to the sense of vision: the cornea becomes dull, and ultimately opaque, or iilcerates, or partially sloughs ; the swollen conjunctival surface of the lids is covered with granulations, and secretes a copious puriform discharge, with or without eversion, accord- ing to the degree of swelling. At first the lids are more or less inverted on account of oedematous swell- ing of the cellular tissue ; in the latter stages, they are everted by thickening and turgescence of the conjunctiva. This membrane is at first villous and of a dusky-brown colour, relaxed, and its vessels enlarged and loaded ; afterwards it becomes hard, almost warty, and ulcerated, and continues to dis- charge puriform fluid. The latter state of the lining of the lid produces disease of the cornea, opacity of a greenish colour, or an ulcer with intolerance of light, and other symptoms of disorganization proceeding in that tissue. The disease is supposed to be conta- gious, and was the scourge of the British army for many years after the campaign in Egypt. In that country it seems to be caused by exposure to cold and damp during the night, and the intense rays of light during the day, more especially when these causes act on eyes which have not been accustomed to such vicis- situdes. After its invasion, it is communicable to others by contact of the morbid secretion; and in individuals who have once been affected, the disease

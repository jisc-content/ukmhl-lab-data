DISEASE OF THE ANTRUM. 1()0 etes of the cavity containing, and from which the tumour has grown, must without doubt afford a bet- ter chance, and is, in every point of view, to be pre- ferred to the old operation of what was called tre- phining the antrum. I have seen the operation per- formed for this soft and malignant growth ; portions of the bone and tumour crumbled under the fingers of the operator—the operation was harsh, painful, and apalling—the case hopeless. Execution of the manual part is not attended with serious difficulty, and it can seldom be necessary to tie arteries pre- viously. To expose the bone, the cheek is divided from the angle of the mouth to the origin of the masseter, and a second incision made from the inner canthus to the edge of the upper lip near the mesial line, detaching the alas of the nose from the maxil- lary bone. The flap of the cheek thus formed is dissected up, and the nasal process of the maxillary bone and the body of the os malae are divided with a saw, or with strong cutting pliers. An incision having been made through the covering of the hard palate, near the mesial line, a small convex-edged saw is applied to the bone ; and the alveolar process is cut through by the pliers, after extraction of the middle and lateral incisors. The bone is then pulled downwards and forwards, and its remaining adhesions separated by means of the knife or pliers. This last part must be accomplished rapidly, so as to reach the vessels, and arrest the haemorrhage. During the progress of the operation, cut branches of the facial and temporal are commanded by ligature or pressure, and the vio-

DISEASES OF THE EYE. 89 the cornea appears sunk in the midst of the swelling, and almost hid by it; this state of matters is termed Inflammatory Chemosis, and only occurs when the excitement is very intense. Blood is frequently effused beneath the conjunctiva in small quantity, in consequence of a bruise or other injury of the eye,—from violent exertion, as during coughing,—or from a less degree of inflammatory action than in the preceding case ; but the swelling thereby occasioned is comparatively trifling, and the effusion is in general speedily absorbed. To this affection the term Ecchymosis is attached. In inflammation of the external parts of the eye, the redness begins from the margins of the organ, and gradually diffuses itself towards the cornea; such is not the case in inflammation more deeply seated. There is intolerance of light in a slight degree, and the patient is inclined to keep the eyelids shut. At first the discharge from the conjunctiva and meibomian glands is increased and changed, and flows occasionally over the cheek, producing a scalding sensation ; when the eyelids are at rest, as during the night, they become glued together by the viscid fluid from the meibomian follicles. But if the inflammation increases in intensity, the discharge is arrested. Even in external inflammation there is more or less constitutional disturbance, proportioned to the violence of the action and the irritability of the system. In most instances the patient complains of headach. The above symptoms subside along with the in- flammation ; but, if this has been at all severe or

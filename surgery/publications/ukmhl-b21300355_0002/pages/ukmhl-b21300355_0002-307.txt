LIGATURE OF CAROTID. 297 deligation must in a great measure depend on the size of the tumour. The artery is most convenient- ly reached where it is crossed by the omohyoideus ; and when deligation at this point is both practicable and eligible, the vessel is exposed at the upper edge of the muscle. But circumstances may require the ligature to be placed much lower. The patient is placed, either sitting or lying, with the head thrown back, and turned slightly to the side opposite the tumour. An incision is made in the upper triangular space of the neck, and in the course of the vessel, midway betwixt the sterno-mas- toid muscle and the muscles covering the forepart of the larynx. Its extent depends on the thickness of the neckâ€”on the muscular developement and quan- tity of fatty matter, whether the neck be long or short. From two to three inches will in general afford sufficient space. The first sweep of the scal- pel penetrates the skin, platysma myoides, and cel- lular tissue. The cervical fascia is then divided carefully, with the hand unsupported. During the incision, the parts should be a little relaxed by atten- tion to the position of the head. The sheath of the vessels is exposed by cautious division of the cellular tissue which occupies the space betwixt it and the cervical fascia. Thin copper spatulae, bent to suit the purpose, are used to keep the edges of the wound apart. In general there is very little bleeding ; but that the operator may be sure of what he cuts, it is necessary frequently to clear the cavity with a bit of soft sponge. Each step of the operation should be

TltACHEOTOMY. 261 circumstances laryngotomy is much more suitable. In tracheotomy, the incision of the tracheal rings can be extended with much less injury than can division of the laryngeal cartilages, when the large- ness of the foreign body, its being firmly fixed, or other circumstances, require that the wound be of considerable size. The risk or danger in the one operation is not much greater than in the other. Di- vision of the crico-thyroid membrane and skin is effected by one incision ; there is nothing important in the way of the knife. Tracheotomy, on the con- trary, requires to be proceeded in more carefully, particularly in children, in whom the neck is short, and the trachea deep. Obstacles may also be pre- sented by the thyroid and other veins being distended, and the soft parts are perhaps tumid and infiltrated with serum. The patient should be seated with the trunk erect, and by throwing back the head, space in the neck is gain- ed. In an adult female on whom I lately operated, this advantage could not be obtained on account of indu- ration in the belly of the sterno-mastoid muscle, with contraction. The incision of the integument is com- menced in the mesial line over the cricoid cartilage, and carried downwards, an inch in the adult, but proportionally shorter in children. The cellular tis- sue is divided by a few touches with the point of the instrument (a small scalpel or bistoury) ; the finger is then introduced to separate the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, and to feel for any stray vessels which may be in the way; for the thyroid arteries

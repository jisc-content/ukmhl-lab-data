14 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. Remarkable effects sometimes result from com- motion of the brain ; the patient may suffer loss of vision or of hearing, either partial or complete ; or partial paralysis may occur, as of the muscles sup- plied by the portio dura. In many cases such affec- tions may be supposed to arise from compression of nerves, or other lsesion subsequent to and caused by the effects of concussion, and probably connected with fracture of the base of the cranium. Again, it oc- casionally happens that the senses are rendered more acute than previously, and of this I shall mention an example which came under my own observation. An old nurse sustained fracture of the vertex, with slight depression of the broken part, in consequence of - some rubbish having fallen on her from a consider- able height. Stupor, along with the other symp- toms of concussion, was the immediate effect of the injury, but disappeared in two or three days. Her hearing, which previously to the accident had been long so obtuse as to render it necessary for her to discontinue her employment, became so intensely acute, that the most trifling noise became a source of pain. She gave immediate orders for the clock to be stopped, the ticking of which annoyed her great- ly. Her hearing gradually became of the natural intensity, and continued perfect. In this case there can be little doubt that restoration of a sense which had long remained dormant arose entirely from cere- bral commotion, for no discharge of blood or other fluid occurred from the ears, by which cerumen ac- cumulated in these organs might have been displaced.

57 DISEASES OF THE SCALP. comatous growths do occur, they are to be excised, with those precautions which were formerly men- tioned when treating of tumours generally. Vascular growths not unfrequently form in the scalp, and attain considerable size ; in general they are either congenital, or the degenerations of naevi materni. They may be so extensive as to for- bid surgical interference ; or they may be so indo- lent, may partake so much of the nature of simple varix, as not to warrant it. If active and small, they can be readily removed by the knife, the incisions be- ing made rapidly, and wide of the diseased structure. If the tumour be prominent and extensive, the em- ployment of ligature is a more safe and equally effec- tual practice. One or two ligatures may suffice to encircle the swelling; or, as in other parts of the body, it may be necessary to pass a great many double ones beneath the part, to separate their extremities, and to tie them to each other around the base of the tumour, the last being drawn so as to tighten all the others. Little benefit can be expected from tying, either at once or at different periods, the larger arte- rial trunks whose ramifications supply the diseased structure, the inosculation amongst the vessels around the tumour being so extremely free. But, in cases where the disease cannot be otherwise combated with any hope of success, ligature of the common carotid, on the affected side, may be tried as a last resource. The practice has proved successful in some cases of this disease, involving parts of the head and face to

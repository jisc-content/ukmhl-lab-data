DISEASES OE THE EYE. 133 is danger of the humours escaping. The best knife is Beer's, well made. The light must be good, the pa- tient's head completely steadied, the eye well fixed by the fingers of the assistant, and the other one covered by a bandage. No speculum should be employed, and the pupil should not be dilated by belladonna. The surgeon, supporting his elbow on his knee, or resting his fingers on the cheek of the patient, holds the knife like a writing pen,—in the right hand, if the left eye is to be operated on, in the left, if the opposite—and ascertains the steadiness of the organ by touching the cornea gently with the side of the knife. The cornea is punctured about a line from its margin, and near the outer extremity of its transverse diameter, the point of the knife being directed towards the centre of the eye, lest it should enter between the laminae. The knife is then passed through the anterior cham- ber, with its side parallel to the iris, and its point is brought out at that part of the cornea exactly op- posite to where it entered: transfixion is thus com- pleted, and by pushing the knife steadily forward without any sawing motion, a semicircular section is effected. As soon as transfixion is accomplished, the operator has complete command of the eye, and all pressure should be taken off—there is no further need for pressure by the assistant, he should now merely keep the eyelid raised. Should the edge of the knife not come easily through the cornea, its passage may be assisted by pressure with the finger-nail. After the pupil has been allowed to dilate by covering the eye for a few seconds with the hand, the capsule

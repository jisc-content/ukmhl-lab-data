STRICTURE OF GULLET. 268 sionally they are much thickened, and the seat of a purulent collection, which subsequently opens into the general cavity. In cases of long standing, ulcer- ation often occurs, usually limited to the neighbour- hood of the stricture. When the parts immediately below the stricture are ulcerated, the circumstance is often attributed to the retching which generally at- tends the disease; but it appears to be the result of morbid action, seated in the parts themselves, similar to the ulcerative process in the larynx following in- flammatory affection. But ulceration occurs as fre- quently above the stricture as below it; and, besides the natural cause to which it is referable, is often produced, or at least aggravated by injudicious or un- skilful attempts to remove the constriction. Though the ulcers seldom enlarge to any great extent, yet in some rare cases, a portion of the parietes of the canal is perforated, and a communication thus established with the trachea, or with the cellular substance amongst the muscles of the neck. Or the ulcers, from either long continuance, or inherent disposi- tion, may assume a malignant action, extend rapid- ly in both width and depth, throw out fungous and unhealthy granulations, form sinuous false passages, and produce a most horrible and intractable dis- ease. But strictures are often of temporary dura- tion, and appear to depend on spasmodic contraction of the circular muscular fibres of the tube. And dysphagia may also arise from an opposite condition of the fibresâ€”from paralysis, in consequence of cere- bral affection, a fatal symptom in any disease.

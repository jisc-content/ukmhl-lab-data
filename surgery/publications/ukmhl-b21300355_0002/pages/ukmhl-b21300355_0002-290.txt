280 AFFECTIONS OF EAR. 'eign Bodies are frequently lodged by children in the meatus auditorius externusâ€”peas, beads, shells, shot, pins, &c. By awkward attempts at removal they are pushed deep into the cavity; and the mem- brane of the tympanum is sometimes broken, as indi- cated by effusion of blood, and swelling of the parts. Violent inflammatory symptoms may be caused by such substances, and will be seriously aggravated by unsuccessful attempts at extraction. Sometimes they are allowed to remain for days or weeks; in such circumstances seeds swell, separate, and begin to throw out a germ, thus fixing themselves more firmly in the passage. They are easily removed at first, by a small silver scoop, of convenient size and form ; and even at a later period, a determined, though not forcible, attempt with the instrument will be followed with success. The scoop is gently and gradually in- sinuated betwixt the membrane and foreignbody; and on its handle being then raised the body is extruded. It is seldom that any excitement follows extraction by this method : but if large and powerful instru- ments be introduced, and force applied, the parts may sustain severe injury, and troublesome consequences ensue: indeed such proceedings have proved fatal. Foreign bodies are also occasionally impacted in the nostrils : the procedure above described is to be adopted. Sometimes they are discharged by the pos- terior nares during attempts at extraction. Polypus of the meatus auditorius externus, is generally of pretty firm consistence, pyriform, some-

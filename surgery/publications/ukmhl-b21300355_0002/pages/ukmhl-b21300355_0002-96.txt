86 DISEASES OF THE EYE. and is irritated by sudden exposure to a degree of light to which it has not been previously accustomed. Different directions of the sun's rays, and different kinds of light, seem to exert different influences on the organ. The rays are most hurtful when they do not fall in a perpendicular direction on the eye, but slopingly or horizontally. Strong light from the moon, and light reflected from scarlet, are also par- ticularly injurious. Undue exertion of the eye weakens it, and renders it prone to become inflamed. The eyes of children are often violently inflamed, in consequence of imprudent exposure to light before they have been gradually accustomed to its stimulus. Again, inflammation is caused by imprudent exposure to cold, of the eye directly, or by exposure of other parts causing suppression of their discharges, whe- ther natural or not. Inflammation of the conjunctiva often follows suppression, however occasioned, of the menstrual or haemorrhoidal discharges, as also suppresion of discharges from the urethra, from the schneiderian membrane., or from behind the ears. Ir- ritations in the neighbouring parts, as in the mouth during dentition, may also excite the disease. Imme- diate irritations, however, are the most frequent cause, as the lodgment of extraneous bodies on the surface of the organâ€”particles of sand, dust, snuff, pepper, or gunpowder, minute insects, loose or in- verted eyelashes. By the presence of such sub- stances, the eye is often kept in a very irritated state for a long period. Violent conjunctival in- flammation is sometimes produced by contact of go-

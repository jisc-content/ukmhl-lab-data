OSTEOSAltCOMA OF JAW. 2&7 bra?, so as to close the air passage, and cause suffo- cation. Disarticulation of one side of the jaw is not unfre- quently necessary; it is absolutely required when the tumour encroaches upon and involves the angle and ramus. It is a more severe operation than excision of part of the bone, and attended with greater risk ; yet it may be advised and undertaken with a very fair and probable chance of ultimate success. The inci- sion of the cheek is made to incline more upwards than those recommended for partial excision, and is extended to over the articulation of the jaw ; from this point, another is made in the direction of the ramus, and prolonged an inch or more beyond the angle. A third incision is made perpendicular to the first, or to the lower lip, over that part of the bone in front which is to be divided. The flap is turned down, and the muscles and membrane of the mouth separated from the bone opposite to the last incision ; after which, the finger is passed through to complete the detachment. The bone is then divided at that point by the saw and pliers, the tooth in the line of the track having been extracted previously to the commencement of the operation. The cut end of the jaw is laid hold by the left hand, and depressed, and the bistoury carried backwards along the internal surface, to effect detachment as far as the angle. The bone is still more depressed, and the temporal muscle cut from the coronoid process. The mass is thus loosened, and forced downwards and backwards on the neck ; the forepart of the capsule is then cut,

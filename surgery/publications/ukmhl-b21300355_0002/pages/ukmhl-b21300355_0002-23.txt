INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 13 and alights on the feet or buttocks; and in such a case also its effects may be in a similar way commu- nicated to the brain, and may produce equally violent effects, without there ever being any appreciable lassion of the cerebral matter. The circulation may be merely disturbed, or lace- ration of the brain may occur with slight extravasa- tion of blood into its substance. In many fatal cases no change in the state, either of the vessels or of the cerebral substance, is perceptible on minute examina- tion ; and again, many patients are supposed to labour under concussion only, in whom fracture of the base of the cranium, or extravasation of blood on ' the surface, or into the substance of the brain, are dis- covered after death. It is always difficult to distin- guish between the effects of mere concussion and those of compression of the brain by extravasated fluid ; for, in the greater number of cases, the symp- toms of both affections are blended together. In both there is insensibility from the first; but if an interval of sensibility occur, diagnosis is rendered more easy and certain, it being a fact well verified by experience, that the state of stupor which precedes the return of correct intellectual function is the effect of concussion, and that there is every reason to believe that the in- sensibility into which the patient subsequently sinks, is caused by compression of the brain; if compression existed from the first, the stupor might not be of longer duration than if it were the effect of concus- sion, but its stillness would not be interrupted by any restoration of mental exercise, however short.

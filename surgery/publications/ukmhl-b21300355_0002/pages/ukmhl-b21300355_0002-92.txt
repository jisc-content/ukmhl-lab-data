DISEASES OF THE EYE. 82 cilia. Sometimes only one or two hairs are at fault; in other instances, the half of the eyelash grows in- wards ; and sometimes there is a double row of cilia; one set being in the usual position, while the other projects against the eyeball. If proper means are not taken to remedy the evil, and moderate the irri- tation which it produces, the cornea becomes thick- ened and changed in structure ; and vision, at first impaired and indistinct, may be entirely lost. The symptoms may be for a time palliated by plucking out the faulty hairs, abstracting blood from the loaded vessels, and subsequently using ointments or collyria,â€”the best of which, perhaps, is the solu- tion of nitrate of silver. In some cases it may be necessary to employ counter irritation, as blistering the nape of the neck ; and in all, the general health must be strictly attended to. Other means may be required, and will be mentioned when treating of chronic ophthalmia. The permanent cure of the disease is effected, either by removal or by destruction of the roots of the cilia. The whole edge of the eyelid, or the offending part of it, is removed with a sharp narrow bistoury, the operator steadying the parts by laying hold of the cilia with the fingers of his left hand. It is necessary to remove the mere edge only, the cilia and their roots, and not the whole of the tarsal cartilage, as lias been proposed. Or the hairs may be extracted by good forceps, such as are used for secu- ring arteries, and a heated needle passed into the canals which contained them, so as to destroy the secreting part, and prevent their regeneration.

282 AFFECTIONS OF EAR. cerumen. The whole may not be brought away at the first sitting; but the injection must be repeated again and again, till the membrane of the tympanum is free. A powerful syringe is required. But it is perhaps unnecessary to enlarge farther on this subject, for such is the division of labour in these days, that a distinct profession is founded on the operation of squirting water into the external ear ; 'tis true that other operations are talked of by these Aurists, as they style themselves, but the advantage to be derived from any of them is often very doubtful. They talk of deafness as arising from a deficient secretion of ceru- men, from dryness or from eruptions in the meatus ; and heating stimulant applications are poured inâ€” oils, ointments, mercurial salts, acetic acid, garlic, &c. all combined. They even go so far as to recommend mercurials to correct the state of the general health, to improve or rectify the chylopoietic viscera, the assistant chylopoietic, and the whole of the digestive organs, upon derangement of w hich, say they, many cases of deafness depend. The fools who apply to such charlatans certainly deserve to have their pock- ets well drained, but ought scarcely to be poisoned. It has been proposed to pass probes into the eus- tachian tubes, to re-establish their continuity if obli- terated, or dilate them if partially closed. No doubt deafness often depends on obstruction of this outlet from the tympanum, the requisite reverberation being perhaps thereby impeded. It may be closed by swell- ing of the lining membrane, by destruction of its extremity from ulceration, by the cicatrization of ulcers in the immediate neighbourhood, by congeni-

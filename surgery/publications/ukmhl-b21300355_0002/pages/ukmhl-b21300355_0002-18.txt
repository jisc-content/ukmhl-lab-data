The swelling is in gene- ral large, soft in the centre, and hard towards its cir- cumference ; the blood in the latter situation being coagulated, and firmly impacted in the condensed cel- lular tissue; whilst in the centre it is fluid, or at least partially so, and occupies a free cavity.

By press- ing the finger or thumb firmly on the centre of the tumour, the blood is displaced, and the bone felt distinctly. In slight cases of this affection, no treat- ment is required, as the tumour is of no import- ance, and soon disappears, by the effused blood being absorbed. When, however, the swelling is accom- panied with unpleasant symptoms, cold applications are to be made to the part, and low diet, with occa- sional purgatives, enjoined. If inflammatory symp- toms occur, local abstraction of blood may be neces- sary, followed by hot fomentations to the part. When the pain has ceased, and the swelling is not speedily removed, absorption is promoted by stimulating ap- plications, such as fomentation with a solution of the muriate of ammonia in a decoction of the anthemis nobilis, in the proportions of 5fs. to lbii., or with a solution of common salt.

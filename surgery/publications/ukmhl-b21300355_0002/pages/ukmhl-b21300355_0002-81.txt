71 DISEASES OF THE EYE. Instruments of different kinds have been introduced through the puncta, through the opening in the sac, and through the termination of the duct under the spongy bone, and have been retained for a longer or shorter period, according to the fancy, or theory, or plan of the surgeon. The first of the methods of introduction is abandoned, as already stated. By the ancients the passages in fault were got rid of altogether, being either cauterized or destroyed by escharotics. The passing of probes into the duct from its lower aperture is useful in removing trifling obstructions caused by concretion of deteriorated mucus, or slight thickening of the lining membrane, and in chronic dilatation of the sac with probable contraction of the duct. But at the same time, it is an operation requi- ring much dexterity, and which ought not to be at- tempted till after much practice on the dead body. The first introduction of the instrument is always the most difficult, from obstruction by a valvular pro- jection of the membrane at the lower orifice, the use of which in the healthy state of the parts must be apparent. Destruction of it renders after introduction of instruments much more easy. Following the probe with catgut bougies properly curved, has been prac- tised in some instances with considerable success. But the preferable practice is making an opening into the sac, and then introducing instruments from the upper orifice of the duct; more especially in cases where the swelling and pain are considerable. The instruments employed for dilatation of the pas-

DISEASES OF THE EYE. 63 mulate in, and distend the sac, or flow over on the cheek, the puncta lachryrnalia remaining open. After increased vascular action has been produced, the lachrymal secretion is increased to a greater or less degree, and much inconvenience is caused to the patient by the profuse discharge following an unna- tural course. When inflammation is intense, lymph is effused into the passages, producing obstruction sometimes complete. The mucous lining of the na- sal duct becomes swollen, from the vascular excite- ment, either throughout its whole extent, or at one point only; and in either case the flow of the tears must be interrupted, either partially or wholly, ac- cording to the degree of swelling. The vitiated se- cretion of the part may also contribute towards nar- rowing the canal, by lodging and concreting there. But a more complete and permanent obstruction is formed by effusion of lymph, under or on the mucous lining, as happens in other canals of similar con- struction : And in this case also, the stricture may be partial or complete, according to the quantity of effused matter, and the extent of surface affected. As the inflammation abates,mucous fluid is copious- ly effused from the surface of the sac, and the swelling increases, though the pain is less. The collected fluid may be partially evacuated through the puncta, either spontaneously, or in consequence of the patient in- stinctively pressing with his finger on the swollen part; or the puncta may be obstructed by the same causes as the nasal duct, and then the discharge of the fluid is prevented in both directions; it consequently

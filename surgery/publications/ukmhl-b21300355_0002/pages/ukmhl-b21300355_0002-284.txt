FOREIGN BODIES IN GUI-LET. 274 times be taken out, by making pressure on both ends, and so forcing the point through the integu- ment. Small pointed bodies, needles, pins, fish bones, &c. often get entangled in the root of the tongue or in the folds of the palate ; on opening the mouth they can be seen, and are easily brought away. If lodged in the pharynx, they can be reached by the finger. The patient is seated with the head thrown back, and the jaws extended ; the finger is introduced with determination, regardless of attempts to vomit, and swiftly passed into all the sinuosities by the side of the epiglottis, into the pouches betwixt the os hy- oides and cornua of the thyroid cartilage, and no part is left unsearched. The substance, when felt, may be extracted without withdrawing the finger by entangling it in the point of the nail; or curved for- ceps may be introduced, and applied conveniently to the body by the guidance of the finger. Great care and caution is required in dislodging the foreign body, when both ends, as is often the case, have pene- trated the parietes ; if it be rudely grasped and pull- ed, the parts are lacerated ; or it breaks, and the sur- geon, after bringing out the portion held in the for- ceps, may find great difficulty in detecting and dis- entangling the other. I have often found it very troublesome to remove delicate needles entire. When they are beyond the reach of the finger, it is of no use to attempt their removal ; the patient suffers great pain during the endeavour, and there is no chance of successful issue ; besides, the surgeon is apt to bring discredit on himself.

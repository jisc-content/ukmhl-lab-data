210 DIVISION OF THE FRCENUM LINGUA. on the application of the ligatures, but soon began to diminish gradually. Every thing was proceeding favourably ; but, on the seventh day, the tongue was attacked with inflammatory swelling, which advanced unsubdued, notwithstanding the most active treat- ment. Sloughing commenced at the apex, and ap- peared extending backwards: I then isolated the protruded portion of the organ by ligature, and thus removed it in three or four days. At that time he complained of no pain, and felt very comfortable. But his system became much disordered soon after; abscesses formed rapidly over both wrists and on the hands, unhealthy infiltration of the cellular tissue took place at the root of the tongue, and amongst the deep muscles at the upper part of the neck, the parts became gangrenous, and he died. Dissection showed that the greater part of the tumour was of the erectile tissue. Division of the Frcenum Lingua; is sometimes, though rarely, required. Division can be necessary only when the frcenum is so short as to confine the point of the tongue, prevent free motion of the organ, and thereby cause indistinctness of articulation. In- fants are often supposed by anxious mothers to have their tongues unduly confined, when no such malfor- mation exists ; in such circumstances, it is almost needless to observe that the part ought not to be interfered with. And even when there is confine- ment, division should not be had recourse to, unless the child is prevented from taking nourishment.

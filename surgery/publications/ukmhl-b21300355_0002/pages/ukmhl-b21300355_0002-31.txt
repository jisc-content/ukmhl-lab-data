INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 21 the bone and dura mater, are not of very frequent occurrence, when symptoms are well watched and treatment properly conducted. But they certainly may and do occur, and usually at a considerable period after the accident : many such cases are re- lated by the older authors. Their attendant symp- toms are materially different from those of extrava- sated blood ; in the latter case, all the symptoms of compression ensue immediately after the effusion has occurred, and that is generally very shortly after the receipt of injury. But matter is seldom, if ever, formed till after a considerable period has elapsed ; and is not attended with symptoms of compression suddenly supervening, but is preceded by restlessness or febrile excitement; and in the later stages only of the affection do the symptoms of cerebral com- pression manifest themselves. By the external in- jury, those blood-vessels by which the dura mater is attached to the scull, and by which it communicates with the pericranium and more external parts, are lacerated, or otherwise materially injured, inflamma- tory action is excited in the connecting medium, unhealthy suppuration ensues, and by the accummu- lation of matter, the membrane is completely sepa- rated from the cranium, and generally participates in the morbid action. It may ultimately slough and give way, and the matter will then be effused inter- nally. A similar process goes on in regard to the bone and its pericranium, a tumour forms externally, and the bone, being deprived of its supply of blood, necessarily dies, either in part, or throughout its

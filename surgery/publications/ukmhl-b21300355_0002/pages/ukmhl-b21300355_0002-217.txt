INFLAMMATION OF THE TONGUE. 207 of a venereal affection, supposed or real, with their faces swollen, and their tongues protruding from their mouths, enormously enlarged. This conse- quence of the exhibition of mercury is more apt to occur in some constitutions than in others, and I have seen it produced in a violent form by the patient's taking only two Plummer's pills.

The patient is unable to speak, deglutition and respira- tion are much impeded, and thirst is excessive. In some instances the inflammation proceeds to sup- puration, but the more general termination is reso- lution. In the more mild cases, a cure will generally be procured by evacuating the bowels freely by means of saline purgatives, and by local abstraction of blood ; the blood may be obtained either from the application of leeches, from opening several of the enlarged superficial veins, or from slight scarifica- tions.

But in more severe cases, the tumour is productive of very great inconvenience to the pa- tient, and is not unattended with danger ; the diffi- culty in breathing may amount almost to suffoca- tion, and in such the treatment must be active. Seve- ral free incisions are to be made longitudinally on the dorsum of the tongue ; from these the effused fluids are evacuated, a considerable quantity of blood escapes, and by consequence the tumour speedily subsides. Superficial incisions are not sufficient, and

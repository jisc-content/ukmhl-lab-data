^4 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. and again having relapsed very quickly into a coma- tose state, in consequence of extravasation of blood. The whole circulation is at first lowered by the shock of the commotion, and the fluid scarcely flows in the cerebral vessels ; but on its restoration, blood is pour- ed out from the lacerated vessels, or from those which have been so injured in their coats as to be unable to withstand the increasing impulse of their contents. As was already observed, the symptoms of compression are often mixed up with those of com- motion, but, when an interval of sensibility has oc- curred, mistake in diagnosis can scarcely occur. Com- pression is attended with slow, stertorous breathing ; a distinct slow pulse ; a relaxed state of the limbs, features, and sphincters ; and dilated pupil. Total insensibility to external impressions attends compres- sion of the brain, whatever the cause of it may be. These symptoms may, and do sometimes, gradually disappear after a time. But they may continue unaba- ted, and the patient may gradually sink under them Or, again, his dissolution may be preceded by excited circulation and furious delirium, the vital powers re- covering from their first depression, only to become roused into violent and destructive action, again to sink to a still lower ebb, and be ultimately annihila- ted. Extravasation is most commonly met with on the lateral parts of the brain ; and the coagulum is perhaps extensive, reaching to the base of the scull, in consequence of rupture of the middle meningeal artery, with or without fracture of the parietal bone. Little or nothing can be done in cases of compress-

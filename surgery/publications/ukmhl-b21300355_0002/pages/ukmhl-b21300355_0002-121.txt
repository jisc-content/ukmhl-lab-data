DISEASES OE THE EYE. Ill they may be touched with caustic, night and morning. When situate on the cornea, they must be left to na- ture. The irritability of Ulcers on the cornea is dimi- nished by the application of nitrate of silver, in solu- tion or substance. If in solution, the application is used in the same way as the collyria, in the propor- tion of three grains of the nitrate to the ounce of distilled water; if in substance, a portion, finely pointed, is gently applied to the sore, which may be afterwards besmeared with a little oil or simple oint- ment, in order to confine the action of the nitrate to the ulcerated part. It is not necessary, but on the contrary hurtful, to rub the nitrate freely on the sore; a very slight application is sufficient to coagulate the secretions on the part, and form a covering for protection of the surface. In two or three days after- wards, when the temporary covering has become de- tached, and when the irritability of the sore has in consequence returned, it will be necessary to repeat the application, but not till then. On each applica- tion, and few are in general required, the sore is found reduced in size considerably. The collyrium nitratis argenti is very useful in many obstinate cases of affections of the eye and eyelids, the strength of the solution having varied, according to circum- stances, from two to ten grains to the ounce. In Albugo and Leucoma, proposals have been made for excising, scraping, or perforating the opaque part; but the cure by such means is worse than the disease, as a raw surface is left larger than the previous opacity, and the cicatrix which must

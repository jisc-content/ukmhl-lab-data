220 SPINA VENTOSA OF THE J AAV. the bony parietes become remarkably thin and deli- cate, particularly at the more prominent parts of the tumour; and at many points bone is deficient, and its place supplied by membraneous expansion. Oc- casionally alteration of structure takes place in the cyst; solid matter is added, either bony or fibro- cartilaginous, and morbid action proceeds in the new deposit. In acute cases* in which the secretion and distension are rapid, severe pain is felt in the part at the first, and usually continues but little ^[abated ; when the swelling is slow and gradual, considerable pain is experienced during the inflammatory stage, but soon diminishes, or ceases entirely. In every instance, the features are deformed, and the functions of the mouth more or less impeded. Osteosarcoma may supervene on spina ventosaâ€” morbid action occurring in the parietes, and morbid deposit ensuing, as in the following instance. The patient was a male, aged 21. Swelling had existed for a considerable time at the posterior part of the lower jaw in the left side. The wisdom tooth and last large grinder had never appeared, and the swell- ing occupied their situation. The bone was expand- ed on each side ; the upper surface of the tumour was soft, its growth had been gradual, and no great pain or uneasiness was experienced. I cut out an oval portion of the cyst where it projected into the mouth, and well-digested matter was evacuated ; a seton was then passed out near the angle of the jaw, and worn for some weeks. The plates of the bone approximated, the cavity contracted, and the dis-

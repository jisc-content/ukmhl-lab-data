255 DISEASES OF WINDPIPE. of an odour intolerably foetid. It sometimes happens that the ulcerations proceed still more deeply, perfo- rating the parietes of the canal, and establishing a communication betwixt the windpipe and gullet; or, if the perforation is anteriorly, the communication is witlj. the cellular tissue on the forepart of the neck, abscess forms which may attain a large size and be productive of much inconvenience and danger. The disease has frequently been produced by mer- cury, when the abuse of that mineral was exceedingly common ; and still its abuse is far from uncommon. The symptoms may be mitigated by counter-irri- tation ; but tracheotomy affords the only hope of per- manent relief; and if performed at an early period, there is every reason to expect that it will prove suc- cessful. It is followed by the beneficial results men- tioned when speaking of the preceding disease, and the nitrate of silver can be applied to the more exter- nal ulcers, along with the internal use of sarsapa- rilla, &c. It may even be practicable to employ topical applications to the ulcers within the cavity of the larynx, as in the following case, which, though unsuc- cessful, shows the advantages to be expected from simi- lar procedure adopted at a more early period. T. C. aged 22, had laboured under the symptoms of phthisis laryngea for five months previous to his application. He was much emaciated, and experienced great diffi- culty in swallowing, on account of the irritation in- duced in the region of the glottis ; he had occasional cough, purulent sputa, and aphonia almost complete.

243 WOUNDS OF NECK. the patient breathes almost entirely by the unnatural opening, and all the respiratory functions are con- ducted imperfectly. But even this state of parts may admit of remedy, as is exemplified by the following case: Elizabeth Oswald, tiged twenty-seven, attempt- ed suicide in 1826, and wounded the larynx through the crico-thyroid ligament. She Was under treatment for several months ; but was at length abandoned with loss of voice, breathing entirely through a silver tube placed in the original wound. On her applying to me, I found the larynx had contracted; an exceedingly minute aperture, not capable of ad- mitting a common probe, extended from the wound towards the glottis, constituting all that remained of the upper part of the natural air passage. Bou- gies, the size of darning-needles, were introduced from the wound into this diminutive canal; and by gradually increasing their bulk, the passage was brought to its natural diameter in less than three months. Part of the trachea below the wound had also contracted considerably, and was dilated by simi- lar means. A long oesophagus tube was introduced by the wound into the mouth, there laid hold of and drawn upwards, and then pushed down into the trachea, so that it extended from the mouth to some inches below the wound of the trachea. Its introduction was followed by a severe fit of coughing, which lasted about half an hour. The tube, nine inches long, and equal in diameter to the largest oesophagus tubes, was retained in the windpipe for fifteen clays,

DISTORTION OF NECK. 294 ated. The swelling increases, with pain, and the chin falls down on the sternum. The patient grows ema- ciated, and perhaps becomes weak in the lower limbs, and even in the upper ; the faeces and urine are im- perfectly retained. Occasionally, abscess forms behind the upper part of the pharynx, increasing the pain and the difficulty of deglutition. On making an exami- nation through the openings by which the abscess has emptied itself spontaneously, the bone is felt bare ; and portions, even large, of the vertebrae, or vertebra, are, after some time, discharged, so as to expose the theca of the spinal cord. Even in such circumstan- ces patients have lingered on, and that so long as to admit of some unprincipled fool advertising a perfect recovery. The termination of caries of the cervical vertebra?, often without any appearance of abscess, is in general fatal and sudden. The head, slipping from its sup- port, falls forwards or to a side, causing immediate and complete paralysis of the whole body ; dissolu- tion soon follows. On examination, the articulating surfaces of the vertebrae are found displaced, and the shreds of ligaments which connected them ruptured. The atlas is separated from the occiput, or the pro- cessus dentatus, escaping from its situation in conse- quence of destruction of its confining ligaments, is found compressing the medulla oblongata. In other instances, the termination may be more slow and gradual; the patient is worn out by long suffering and continued purulent discharge ; change of struc- ture takes place in the theca vertebralis. or in the

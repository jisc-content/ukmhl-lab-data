DISEASES OF THE EYE. 94 purulent. The vessels of the part, both veins and arteries, previously carrying colourless fluid, become much dilated, and are filled with red blood. Writers on ophthalmic surgery, in their rage for refinement, speak of three kinds of this inflammationâ€”inflamma- tion of the external or conjunctival covering, of the middle tunics or cornea propria, and, lastly, of the third coat, the capsule of the aqueous humour : such distinctions, however, are found to effect no good practical end, and it is unnecessary to follow them. One particular layer of the cornea may be first at- tacked, but the whole structure soon becomes invol- ved. The inflammation generally commences in the conjunctival covering. Vision is necessarily much obscured from even slight inflammatory affection of the cornea. Part only of the organ may be affected, but frequently the whole is involved. Sometimes only one or two vessels remain dilated, but still they, j>assing over the centre of the cornea, render vision indistinct. Opacity of the cornea, to a greater or less degree, always attends dilatation of its vessels. In inflammation of the internal and middle tunics of the cornea, most of the enlarged vessels which traverse it are seen to be continuations of those in the sclerotic coat, and are smaller, more numerous, and less appa- rent than those of the conjunctiva. The cornea and the sclerotic immediately surrounding it frequently appear to be almost entirely covered with meshes of their capillaries. At first the whole cornea has a clouded appearance, but as the disease advances, por- tions become distinctly opaque, and at these points

187 CONGENITAL DEFICIENCIES. nant disease in the lip, is attended with danger, and not followed by any benefit. But for this disease I have known most bloody and cruel operations under- taken, even portions of the jaw to which the glan- dular tumours adhered have been cut out. Such proceedings cannot be too strongly reprobated. Congenital Deficieticies of Lips, Palate, &p.â€”Con- genital deficiency of the lip uniformly occurs in the upper one ; it is either simple or complicated. Fre- quently there is only a fissure on one side of the mesial line. This may, though seldom, be combined with division of the soft or of the hard palate; or there may be a fissure on each side of the mesial line, with an intervening flap. The flap may be either of the same length as the rest of the lip, or more or less shortened ; and it may be either free, or attached to part of the alveolar process. In such cases as the latter, the central alveolar processes and teeth often project considerably beyond the arch of the hard palate, greatly increasing the deformity. The defi- ciency of the lip produces a disgusting and horrible deformity of the countenance ; and when there is division of the palate, the voice is indistinct, or al- most unintelligible. The simple fissure of the lip, without deficiency of the palate, is easily remediable by operation. As already mentioned, the fissure is to one side of the mesial line ; and its edges, covered by a continuation of the prolabium, are rounded off at their lower part. The operation is not attended with much loss of blood, nor is it very painful. It can be performed at any

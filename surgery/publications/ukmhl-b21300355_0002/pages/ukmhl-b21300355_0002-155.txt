145 DISEASES OF THE EYE. such as to cause much stretching of the optic nerve, blindness more or less complete remains. Fatal effects may follow wound of the eye, on account of the foreign body, as a sharp-pointed instrument, penetrating the thin parietes of the orbit, splintering the bone, and injuring the brain. Orbital Inflammation.â€”Inflammation seldom at- tacks the parts situated between the orbit and the eyeball; but when it does, the affection is very serious. The action is very acute, and proceeds rapidly to suppuration. The pain is excruciating, extends to the whole head, accompanied with a sen- sation of extreme tension in the orbit, and is much increased by the slightest motion cf the eye: and from the matter accumulating around the ball, and being confined to the unyielding orbit by the dense fibrous expansion which extends from the margin of the orbit to the anterior surface of the eyeball, the globe is pushed forwards, and distends the lids. The palpebral become erysipelatous, and swollen by serous effusion. Violent inflammatory fever occurs ; and, as the disease advances, all the symptoms are aggra- vated, and become almost intolerable. The globe is farther protruded, and the retina is insensible to light. At length the accumulated matter makes its way to the surface, and is discharged, giving great relief to the patient, and permitting the protruded globe to regain its situation. The inflammation seldom extends to the eyeball. In the early stage of this affection, the most deci- PAItT it. K

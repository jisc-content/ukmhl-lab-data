ABSCESS OF THE ANTRUM. 180 decayed teeth, or, the anterior thin parietes being absorbed, comes down by the side of the canine or small molar teeth, and is discharged slowly, so as to annoy the patient by its flavour and fetor, without the abscess being emptied, or a chance of cure afforded. Accumulations of fluid sometimes take place in this cavity, give rise to great enlargement of the sinus, and continue for many months, without pain or much inconvenience, and without any matter escaping. The bony parietes are attenuated, yield to slight pressure, and return to their original level with a crackling noise, such as is produced by parch- ment. The contained fluid is thin, greyish, and con- tains flocculent solid particles. In short, the antrum maxiHare is occasionally the seat of chronic, as well as of acute abscess. Cancerous ulceration sometimes takes place in the cavity ; the matter is not long confined, the parietes soon soften, the teeth drop out, the alveolar processes disappear, and a large opening is formed, which fur- nishes a foetid, sanious discharge. In inflammation of the antrum, carious teeth must be removed, blood abstracted from the neighbourhood of the affected part—leeches being applied tp the gums, the schneiderian membrane, and the integu- ments—and fomentations to the cheek should be fre- quently and assiduously employed. When the cavity has become distended with fluid—mucous, mucopu- rulent, or purulent—such must be evacuated without delay ; and the opening must be of such size, and so situated, that the fluid may escape as soon as secreted.

186 FORMATION OF NEW LIP. responding portion of the integuments is reflected upwards, a thick attachment being left at the sym- physis menti. The callous margins of the space formerly occupied by the original lip are pared ; and the flap, having been twisted round, is adapted to the edges of the wound, and retained by points of interrupted or convoluted suture. To insure adhe- sion, the attachment at the chin should be left thick and fleshy, and the flap should not consist of mere in- tegument, but contain no small share of the subcu- taneous cellular and adipose tissues, in order that circulation may be vigorous in the part. The inte- guments below the chin are naturally loose, and con- sequently the margins of the wound there are readily approximated. The flap soon becomes oedematous, and remains so for some days ; it must be supported by a compress and bandage. After adhesion of its upper part is completed, the mental attachment, which prevented the lower portion from uniting, is to be removed ; a bistoury is introduced beneath the non- adhering point, and carried down so as to divide the attachment, which is then removed by a second stroke of the knife. The lower part of the flap is now laid flat and close to the chin, and supported by a bandage. In the adult, union may be retarded by the edges of the flap twisting inwards, and inter- posing their beard between the opposed surfaces ; When such is the case, the offending margins must be pared away. The advantages of such an operation, when successful, are too evident to require detail. Removal of glands in the neck or beneath the jaw that have become diseased in consequence of malig-

OSTEOSARCOMA OF JAW. 225 and passing over the space which was occupied by the extracted teeth. The flap is dissected up, and the membrane of the cheek divided along the line of in- cision. The bistoury is then carried along the inside of the bone so as to divide the membrane of the mouth and separate the attachments of the muscles. The tongue is pushed aside, and a copper spatula placed under the jaw at the part to be divided, in order that the soft parts may not be injured during the sawing. A small narrow saw, or one commonly known by the name of Hey's, is applied to the bone at the points where the teeth were extracted, and by a few motions of this instrument a notch is made of no great depth ; a pair of strong cutting pliers are placed in the track, and by them division of the bone is accomplished with equal neatness, and much more rapidly than if the use of the saw had been continued. The pliers should be strong in every point, and the handles long, to afford the advantage of a powerful lever. The chain saw has been recommended for performing the section of the bone, but I have not yet seen one to be depended on; it is not only slow, but uncertain, in its operation. The incisions may be made otherwise. The cheek may be divided by passing through it a long narrow bistoury, close to the anterior edge of the masseter muscle, and carrying the instrument forwards and through at the angle of the mouth. From each ex- tremity of this incision another is made downwards, the anterior one inclining forwards, the other back- PART II. p

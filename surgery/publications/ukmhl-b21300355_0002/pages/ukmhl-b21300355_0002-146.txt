136 DISEASES OF THE EYE. from being uniformly successful, and ought not to be had recourse to unless vision is entirely lost, or so much impaired as to be insufficient for the guid- ance of the patient's steps. It is necessary on ac- count of central opacity of the cornea—leucoma with entanglement of the iris—and entire closure of the pupil, or diminution of it with concealment of the remainder by corneal opacity. It may be required after badly performed extraction of a cataract, the iris being entangled in the scar of the incision at a distance from the junction of the cornea with the sclerotic; or on account of closed pupil from inflam- mation, when perhaps the cornea is all clear. The operation is varied according to the size of the an- terior chamber, the presence or not of the chrystal- line lens, the extent of sound cornea, and the condi- tion of the iris. Interference is useless when disease of the retina is suspected, from the extent of the previous disease—from violent inflammation, with or without discharge of part of the contents of the eyeball. Three distinct methods of operation are pursued. I. Simple division of the iris, or corotomia, may be practised when the iris is stretched, as after extrac- tion. It is performed by introducing a small knife, like a needle, through the anterior or posterior cham- ber—the surgeon being in this regulated by the size of the anterior chamber and the presence or not of the lens—pushing its point through the iris, or cut- ting that membrane vertically or horizontally to an extent sufficient for the transmission of light.

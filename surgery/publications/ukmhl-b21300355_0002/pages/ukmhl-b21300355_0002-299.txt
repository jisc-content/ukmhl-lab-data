289 ABSCESS OF NECK. tion. An artificial aperture must be made early; and over all the upper and most exposed parts of the neck, this should be in the direction of the folds, and small. When many and extensive collections have formed, when the integuments have been undermined and attenuated before advice is sought, it is impossible to prevent deformity. The knife and potass are required, for reasons assigned in the preceding part of this work ; and the detached glands, as well as the thin- ned skin, stand in need of their free application. Deep-seated collections may originate in glandular disease, or commence in the cellular tissue ; they oc- casionally follow transverse wounds of the neck. Great infiltration of the cellular tissue supervenes over the trachea and sternum, and also under the fasciae; purulent matter is secreted in the cells, and the parts are extensively separated; sloughing is pre- vented only by free and early incision. The nature and extent of the coverings of an abscess seated deeply in the neck, are to be kept in view—the platysma myoides, the superficial and deep cervical fasciae. Collections under these interfere with the functions of the neighbouring parts, and are attended with great pain, which is somewhat relieved by rest- ing the chin on the sternum, and so relaxing the fas- ciae. The matter makes its way to the top of the sternum, and generally points on the outside of the sterno-mastoid muscles. But before the integuments become thin, the deep parts have been seriously in- jured—cellular tissue sloughed, muscles separated PART II. t

INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 18 to, and may now be pushed pretty freely, there being less risk of inordinate action ensuing, and much reason to fear that life will be prolonged only by the continued use of powerful means for the excitement of the system. Nor ought the surgeon to cease sti- mulating though the vital powers continue to dimi- nish in spite of the treatment, and though the cir- cumstances of the case may be so hopeless as to lead him to suppose that death cannot be further delayed ; for many patients, who would otherwise have neces- sarily perished, have, by the continued use of stimuli, recovered their sensibility, and been ultimately re- stored to health.

The blood may be absorbed, or an unhealthy abscess may form be- tween the bone and membrane, attended with violent, dangerous, and, if neglected, fatal results. The in- ternal mischief is not without external marks of its occurrence. If the scalp is undivided, a puffy tu- mour forms; and, when it has been injured, the wound degenerates, its surface is pale, and the discharge gleety, and the exposed bone appears white and dry.

DISEASES OF THE EYE. 113 the surface has at length become clean, the same treatment is required as to an ulcer of the part. In conical cornea, nothing can be done towards improving the form of the organ. But vision is ren- dered more distinct by the use of a double convex glass, so adapted that the patient looks through a very small aperture. If the surface, however, of the cornea be irregular as well as conical, no great benefit can result from such means. When staphyloma is small, neither impeding the motions of the eye, nor preventing its being protected by the lids, no surgical interference is called for, as the loss or impairment of vision cannot be remedied, and as no other inconvenience than blindness is produced by the change of form in the part. But when the dis- eased cornea projects from between the eyelids, the prominence must be diminished, on account of the deformity which it occasions, and in consequence of the eye being deprived of its natural protection of the lids, and being thereby exposed to constant irri- tation. In such cases, it is necessary to take away a portion of the cornea, that the eye may be so dimi- nished in bulk as to retract within the eyelids ; and the size of the part removed must be proportioned to the degree of protrusion. A cornea-knife is pushed into the prominence, and carried forwards so as to transfix the part, in a direction from the external to the inner canthus ; and by the knife being pushed on, with its cutting edge looking downwards, a flap of the cornea is made. This flap is then laid hold of PART II. H

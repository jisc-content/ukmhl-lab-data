The point of the probe being introduced into the punctum, either superior or in- ferior, must first be carried towards the nose for about 2-10ths of an inch, the instrument being lightly held betwixt the fore and middle fingers of the right hand. It is then directed downwards and back- wards. Care must be taken to prevent entangle- ment in folds of the membrane. Should obstruction be felt, the instrument is withdrawn a little, and then carefully and gently carried in the right direction. The small syringe is managed with one hand, whilst with the forefinger of the other, the punctum not occupied by the pipe is compressed. Neither can much or any benefit be expected to follow attempts to force obstruction in the lachrymal passages, by the weight of a column of mercury. A plan of dilating and rectifying the nasal duct by styles introduced through the puncta has been pro- posed, but scarcely deserves to be mentioned as a means of cure. When suppuration is threatened, with increase of the swelling, inability of the patient to empty the sac by pressure, redness of the integuments, &c, an early opening should be made into the tumour, in order to prevent further and more serious mischief. A small opening into the sac cannot be productive of so much injury as forcible dilatation of the canaliculi, follow- ed by and causing ulceration. The point of a straight

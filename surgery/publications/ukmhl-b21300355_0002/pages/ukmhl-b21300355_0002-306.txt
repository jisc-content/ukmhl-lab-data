296 LIGATURE OF CAROTID. and the edges of the wound are put together with a bit of court plaster, or by means of a compress and bandage lightly applied. Ligature of the common Carotid may be required for the cure of aneurism at the angle of the jaw; or on account of hemorrhage from deep wounds in the same situation, when, from any circumstances, the divided extremities of the vessels cannot be secured. A deep incision at the angle of the jaw, towards the base of the cranium, not only divides important branches of the carotid, but may also wound the vertebral arteries where they project tortuous betwixt the dentata and atlas, or betwixt the latter bone and the occiput. Ligature of the common carotid has been had re- course to to stop bleeding from the mouth, nostrils, and other parts connected with the face—for the cure of large or deep-seated aneurism by anastomosis,— and as a preliminary step to the removal of large and firmly attached morbid growths of the face or neck. This last proceeding, as already remarked, does not in any way enhance the patient's safety, whilst it adds much to his suffering. The carotid has also been tied for the cure of aneurism at the root of the neck, when it was im- possible to place a ligature betwixt the tumour and the heart. My opinion regarding this practice I have given formerly, when treating of aneurism in general. For aneurism at the angle of the jaw, the point of

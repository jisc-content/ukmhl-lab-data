226 OSTEOSARCOMA OF JAAV. wards. By reflection of the flap thus formed, the bone is exposed more easily, rapidly, and perfectly, than by the former mode of incision. In either method, no artery, except the facial, re- quires to be secured by ligature. After division of the bone, the attachments of the tumour, which may not have been separated previously, are cut with the bistoury, the cavity is filled lightly with charpie, and the incisions are carefully and neatly put together, and retained by points of interrupted and twisted suture ; the latter form of suture being adopted at those points where accurate coaptation is most important. The symphysis of the lower jaw has been removed, and its extirpation may again be rendered necessary, either on account of tumour commencing in its inter- nal structure, or from disease of the sockets extending deeply and approaching the base. I removed it in a case of malignant disease, by which, and by the ap- plications used as remedies, great ravages had been made on the under lip ; the gums and alveoli were involved, as also the bone, to a considerable extent, without any apparent affection of the lymphatics. Nothing untoward occurred in the operation, and the case was proceeding favourably ; but after some weeks the patient was seized with violent erysipelas of the face and head, and perished. One objection to the operation is, that the muscular attachments of the tongue to the symphysis, cannot be divided with- out some risk ; the antagonist muscles are unre- strained ; the os hyoides and root of the tongue may be drawn backwards upon the forepart of the verte-

84 DISEASES OF THE EYE. siderable part of the cornea is covered. Pterygium is in general single, but sometimes, though very rarely, there are two or more pterygia on one eye ; and in such cases the patient's vision is seriously affected, in consequence of the apices of the different pterygia uniting and coalescing on the cornea, and investing the greater part of that organ with a thick and dark shade. When several occur, they some- times unite throughout their whole extent, and cover the half or more of the eye ; and to this form of the disease the term Pannus has been attached. When the pterygium is of considerable size, ex- tending over the cornea, the only remedy is excision. The apex of the web is laid hold of and pulled out- wards by forceps or a hook, and the whole diseased part is then carefully dissected off with scissors, the incisions commencing at the apex, and being carried on to the base. The wound gradually contracts, and though an opaque cicatrix must form on the corneal surface, the speck is of much less dimensions than the space formerly occupied by the pterygium. If the web be thin and not exceedingly vascular, it may be suffi- cient to make a semicircular section of it transverse- ly, by means of a hook and scissors, between its base and the margin of the cornea ; its growth is thereby arrested, and there is a probable chance of its begin- ning to diminish, and ultimately disappearing. When it is small, and so situate as to cause no impairment of vision, it is prudent and good practice not to inter- fere with it at all.

146 DISEASES OE THE EYE. dedly antiphlogistic measures are imperiously called for. When fluctuation can be felt, or when the symptoms indicate that suppuration has taken place, whether fluctuation is perceptible or not, an early opening into the affected part should be made through the dense orbital ligament. Thus a free exit is allowed for the matter, the patient is instant- aneously relieved, and the extent of the local mischief is limited. It is unsafe to wait for the spontaneous evacuation of the matter; such a process is neces- sarily tedious ; and before it has been accomplished, the orbital bones may have become diseased ; they may have given way at certain points, and the matter may have escaped within the cranium. The arti- ficial opening should always be free, and deep if necessary. Tumours in the orbit.â€”Sarcomatous tumours occa- sionally form in the cellular tissue of the orbit. They occur at all periods of life, and may, by slow and gradual increase, protrude the eyeball, and disturb its functions ; or their growth is rapid, and accom- panied with great suffering. In some cases, the eye is protruded to a great degree, and by the extension of the optic nerve vision is impaired ; in others, the patient is totally blind at the commencement of the disease. Yet the eye may be displaced to no small extent, without amaurosis following; the optic nerve appears to bear a good deal of extension, without disturbance of its functions. The majority of tumours in this situation are of rapid growth, their structure

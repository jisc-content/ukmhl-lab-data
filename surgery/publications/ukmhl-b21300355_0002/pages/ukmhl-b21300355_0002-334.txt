.'324 VENESECTION. come to a proper conclusion regarding what is the most proper and judicious course to be pursued in any one case. They follow a routine, and bleeding is too generally the commencement of it. But venesection is absolutely required in many cases, and must be the principal dependence of the surgeon for removing or preventing evil consequences. After injuries, when the circulation has been restored, particularly when parts important to life are involved —in the first stage of inflammatory attacks, with violent constitutional disturbance—in inflammatory affection of vital or important organs—in these, bleed- ing is employed to an extent sufficient to control the action. But even in such circumstances, the prac- titioner must be cautious not to push depletion too far, but to stop short at the proper time, so that the life of the patient may not be endangered, nor his health impaired, more by the treatment than by the disease. Venesection is usually practised on either the basi- lic or the cephalic vein, or else on either the median basilic or the median cephalic. The vein is made to rise by obstructing the return of the blood by a liga- ture on the arm, applied not so tight as to prevent the flow in the arterial branches. A vessel removed from the inner side of the tendon of the biceps,—that is not over or near the brachial artery,—is to be pre- ferred. But sometimes none sufficiently large or dis- tinct can be perceived unless in that situation, and then great caution is necessary in making the punc- ture ; the patient's arm must be held very steady,

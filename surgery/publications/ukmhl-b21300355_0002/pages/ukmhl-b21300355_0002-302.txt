DISTORTION OF NECK. 292 the application of the nitrate of silver over the course of suspected nerves, are sometimes followed with benefit, and may be accompanied by the internal administra- tion of antispasmodics, though the efficacy of these is often doubtful. Division of the muscle was a favour- ite operation of old surgeons for the cure of wry neck. One of the heads, or both, may be detached from the sternum and clavicle ; but such procedure is not likely to be followed with much advantage. Distortion of the neck is most frequently produced by some vice in the bones, as curvature, from soften- ing, attended with deformity of the trunk or of the limbs. In such cases, the twist is generally to the right side, the ear approaching the shoulder. No treatment can be effectual, unless the other curva- tures are corrected; for the head is placed so, to pre- serve the equilibrium of the body. The head is to be supported, and its weight removed from the vertebral column, by a curved iron rod attached to the back of stays fastened on the loins, leathern straps passing from the top of the rod under the chin and over the occiput. By the use of such apparatus for a consi- derable time, the vertebral column may regain its perpendicular direction, and all deformity of the neck be consequently removed. In slight cases, this treat- ment is not required ; on giving support to the trunk, and raising the shoulders to an equal level, the mus- cles of the back, perhaps stimulated by powerful and repeated friction, gradually bring the column into its proper form. Then the position of the head to one side is no longer required to balance the body.

208 ENLARGEMENT OF TONGUE. the practitioner should not shrink from cutting tole- rably deep ; for although the wounds may appear ghastly in the engorged and tumid condition of the organ, yet, when the swelling subsides, and the tongue regains its usual bulk, their size is so remark- ably diminished, that they resemble trifling scarifica- tions, and, in some instances, are almost impercepti- ble. Their extent and number must vary according to the size of the tumour, and the urgency of the concomitant symptoms. If such practice should fail in diminishing the swelling, and affording relief to the respiration, it may become necessary either to perform tracheotomy, or to introduce a gum-elastic tube from the nares into the windpipe. If the inflammation terminate in suppuration, the abscess must be treated on the same principles as those occur- ring in other parts of the body. The tongue is also subject to gradual and perma- nent enlargement. A remarkable case of this nature occurred to me lately, and I shall here detail it. The patient was a male, aged 19.

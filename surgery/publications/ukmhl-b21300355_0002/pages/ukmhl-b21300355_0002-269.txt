Occasionally the foreign body becomes so placed in the canal, as to form a complete valve, and then the labours of the patient to dislodge it are most painfully severe; if they fail, he is suffocated. The parts may at length get accustomed to the pre- sence of the foreign body, and all uneasiness subside. But danger, though not immediate, still remains. Foreign bodies have remained for years without causing much inconvenience ; but in such cases they have generally settled in some remote ramification of the bronchia; abscess takes place around, puru- lent expectoration follows, all the symptoms of pul- monary phthisis are established, the patient grows hectic, and dies. The existence of the foreign body, when suspected, is to be ascertained by accurate and attentive exami- nation along the forepart of the neck, and by lis- tening carefully to the sounds which may be present in the trachea; but the urgency and continuance of the symptoms will seldom leave the surgeon to entertain a doubt. If he attentively watch the pa- tient, he can scarcely be mistaken. It has been recommended to examine the oesophagus previously to adopting active measures, a large foreign body impacted in that passage being capable of materially obstructing respiration by compression of the tra- chea, and it is safe and prudent to follow this recom- mendation whenever the least uncertainty exists re- garding the real nature of the case.

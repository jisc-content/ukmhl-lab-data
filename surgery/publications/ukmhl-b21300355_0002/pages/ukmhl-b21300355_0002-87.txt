DISEASES OF THE EYE. tional disturbance. On the whole, encanthis is a rare disease ; however, I have seen, and operated in, seve- ral instances of it. Encysted Tumours of the Eyelids.â€”These occur beneath the conjunctival lining of either the upper or under lid, but most frequently in the for- mer. They form rapidly, but seldom attain any con- siderable size; and may be found to contain, along with glairy fluid, a mixture of pus, or curdy matter. The contents, however, are generally glairy, rarely atheromatous. The cysts are very thin and adherent, and the tumour projects externally, forming a dusky red elevation of the integuments. They cause con- siderable deformity, watering of the eye, and stiff- ness and difficulty in moving the lids. On everting the eyelid, the contents of the tumour are seen shin- ing through the distended conjunctiva, and present a bluish appearance. They are seldom single, may attain a considerable size if not interfered with, and are not remediable but by operation. It is improper to attempt their extirpation from without, as there is a certainty of cutting completely through the eye- lid, the inner covering of the cyst being merely at- tenuated conjunctiva. The lid is to be everted, and an incision made into the prominent and thin cyst with the point of a cataract knife ; the contents can then be readily scooped out with the end of a probe. It is impossible to dissect out the tender cyst entire, and when this is attempted, the cure can seldom be permanent. If, after incision and discharge of the

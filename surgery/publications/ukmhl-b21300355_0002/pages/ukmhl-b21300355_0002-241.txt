Paralysis, more or less extensive, follows division of the nerves and muscles. But paralysis of the face also arises from a variety of other causes ; it often remains after inju- ries of the head, probably in consequence of extrava- sation in the brain; it attends on morbid formations in the substance of the brain, or in its membranes, and follows long continued irritation in the neighbour- hood of the nerves. Paralysis from the last men- tioned causes is not likelv to be recovered from ; that following simple division of nerve, may disappear after a considerable time, the nervous tissue reuni- ting, and resuming its functions. When there is reason to suppose that the nervous function is alone deranged, while the structure remains sound and the continuity undissolved, advantage may follow the application of strychnine to a raw surface over the course of the affected nerves. In Tic Doloureux, division of the nerves of the face, as they pass out of the foramina, is seldom resorted to ; nor ought it to be practised, unless at the urgent request of the patient, and after all other means have failed to afford relief; and even then the operation is scarcely warrantable, since it may be said never to have succeeded. We must trust to milder measures, to the removal of local irritations, to paying strict attention to the digestive organs, to the administra- tion of purgatives, tonics, and anodynes ; and occa-

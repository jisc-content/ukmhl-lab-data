And when the disease has made considerable progress, temporary relief may be obtained from puncturing the cornea at its lower part, so as to discharge the accumulated aqueous humour ; but a cure can scarcely be expected from such a practice, however often the paracentesis may be repeated. In the worst cases the pain is so ex- cruciating, and the system so much disturbed by the local affection, as almost to warrant the destruction of the organ, in order to relieve the patient; but after all, even such severe measures will most probably prove unavailing. In JExophthalmia, the treatment must vary ac- cording to the circumstances which cause the pro- trusion of the eyeball. Of Internal Ophthalmia.â€”Inflammation of the internal parts of the eyeball sometimes supervenes on conjunctival inflammation, and then the dis- tinctive characters of the two affections are not per- ceptible. When inflammatory action attacks the deep parts primarily, the external ciliary vessels ramifying on the sclerotic coat are seen, enlarged, shining through the conjunctiva; and as they ad- vance towards the clearer part of the eye, they form a reticulated zone, of a pink colour, near the margin of the cornea; but between the zone and the cornea a distinct white line is interposed. Then large, arbo- rescent vessels soon appear on the white part of the eye, and from their being more superficial than the

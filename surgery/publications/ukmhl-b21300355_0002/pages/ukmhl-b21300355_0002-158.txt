The whole coats of the eye are seldom involved, part remains sound, but compressed and disfigured by the morbid mass, and the humours are either absorbed or discharged. Circumscribed tumours, exterior to the ball, and surrounded by a cellular cyst, may be removed by careful and cautious dissection, without injury to the important parts.

The tumour is exposed, laid hold of with a hook or small vulsellum, and sepa- rated from its attachments by a knife, the edge of which is directed towards the new growth.â€”A man. aged 26, had laboured under blindness with exoph- thalmos for eighteen months. A tumour could be felt above the eyeball, and I dissected it out, along with the lachrymal gland, to which it adhered. It was of medullosarcomatous structure, and of the size of a plum ; at one point it contained a mass of coagulated blood. After its removal, the eye resumed its place and functions. The patient remains well; but such favourable cases are rare. If the affection be more extensive, it may be neces- sary to remove all the contents of the orbit: but in disease involving all the structures, there is little chance of the patient remaining free ; it almost uni- formly returns, as also when it has commenced in parts of the eyeball. The optic nerve is often aflect-

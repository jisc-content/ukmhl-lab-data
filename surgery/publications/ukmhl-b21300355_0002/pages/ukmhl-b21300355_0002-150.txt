The disease either advances to com- plete blindness, or stops in its destructive progress, leaving the patient with vision impaired to a greater or less degree. When the disease is established, pain in the head and eyes usually either ceases quickly and entirely or gradually abates. Amaurosis is sometimes temporary, occurring at regular intervals; and during its accession it often varies in intensity.

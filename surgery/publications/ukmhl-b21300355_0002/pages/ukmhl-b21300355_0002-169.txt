DISEASE OF THE ANTRUM. 159 hot iron, and by this implement, or by dossils of lint, the haemorrhage is easily arrested. But such operations, considering the result of those which have been practised, are scarcely justifiable. It has been proposed to remove the tumour, along with its investment—to separate and dissect out the superior maxillary bone. It is a very severe operation, and one which puts the patient's life in imminent jeopardy, from profuse haemorrhage or constitutional disturbance. In one case, the surgeon began the operation after having tied the common carotid of the affected side, but, having made the incisions of the cheek and palate, was obliged to desist on account of the violent bleeding ; eight days after, the com- mon trunk of the temporal and internal maxillary was tied on the opposite side, and the incisions re- peated, but the result was the same ; the growth increased, and the patient perished. The disease is very insidious in its progress, and has gained much ground before the patient becomes alarmed and ap- plies for surgical aid. The parietes of the antrum are expanded and softened ; the tumour has project- ed behind through the tuberous process, upwards through the plate of the orbit, or inwards to the nostril; and has contaminated by its presence and contact all the neighbouring parts. Then removal of the maxillary bone, or of all the bones in that side of the face, can be of no service. The disease is seldom if ever seen by the surgeon early enough to admit of any operation being practised with the least chance of ultimate success. At a sufficiently early period, the removal of the bone—of the pari-

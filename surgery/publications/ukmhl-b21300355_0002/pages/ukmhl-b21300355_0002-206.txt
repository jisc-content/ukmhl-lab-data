INFLAMMATION OF FAUCES. 196 ing out suddenly during the painful and laborious efforts at respiration, and escaping into the air pass- ages ; fatal results have thus taken place, and to pre- vent such the abscess should be opened early. When the swelling is large, and attended with alarming symptoms, the matter is most conveniently evacuated by a flat and long trocar and canula. If the abscess be small, and the breathing not affected, there will be no danger in allowing the collection to burst sponta- neously. Suppuration may also occur in the external glandular tumour, or in the surrounding cellular tis- sue. When sloughing to any extent takes place, it is in patients of an extremely debilitated habit of body, or when the affection is attendant on disease of a ma- lignant character. Metastasis may take place to the larynx, to the trachea, or to the lungs, either sponta- neously, or inconsequence of repercussiveapplications. Chronic abscesses are occasionally met with in these parts, or behind the upper part of the pharynx un- connected with disease of the subjacent bones. The matter must be evacuated as soon as its existence is ascertained. No great accumulation should be allow- ed to take place in any situation, far less in the immediate neighbourhood of important parts. Scarification of the tonsils and surrounding mem- brane is seldom required. A lancet concealed in a ca- nula, with a spiral spring to withdraw its point, is used for this purpose, and for opening abscesses ; but dan- gerous and fatal results may ensue, and have actually followed such incisions of these parts.

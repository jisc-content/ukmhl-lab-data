INJURIES OF THE HEAD. scull, only a slight commotion of the brain is induced, the cranial contents are, as it were, slightly jumbled, and a temporary and trifling confusion of its functions follows. When, however, the stroke is more severe, the brain is separated from its cranial attachments, both at the point struck and at the part directly oppo- site,â€”it is thrown upon itself towards its centre ; its substance is thereby condensed, its diameter in the direction of the impulse is diminished, and a vacuity between the brain and cranium is formed at each extremity of that diameter. By post mortem exami- nations, it has been ascertained that condensation of the brain does exist in cases of severe concussion. Such commotion may be sufficient to cause instant extinction of life, or the brain may gradually resume its former condition, or the empty spaces may be occupied by effused blood or serum ; for a vacuum cannot long exist, and extravasation is extremely liable to occur in such cases, the blood-vessels being either compressed, stretched, or otherwise thrown out of their natural relations, along with the other cranial contents. Perhaps the brain does not recover itself gradually, but suddenly ; the impulse, which was at first directed from the circumference towards the centre, now acting from the centre towards the circumference ; and then the propulsions and recoil- ings may be repeated, though gradually lessening in their intensity, until the effect of the original impulse is lost, and all vibration consequently ceases. But concussion may be caused by an impulse received not on the cranium, but on some other part of the body, as when a person falls from a considerable height

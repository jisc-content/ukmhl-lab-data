67 DISEASES OF THE EYE. are not always co-existent; and besides, the affection of the surface of the lachrymal sac and ductus ad narera is as likely to be the consequence of morbid action, extending upwards from the nostrils, as of morbid secretion from the eyelids blocking up and irritating the puncta and the lachrymal passages. Disease of the meibomian glands in the under eyelid often exists along with disease of the lachrymal pas- sages, but the latter is generally the primary affec- tion ; the conjunctival covering of the eyelid is at the same time inflamed, swollen, and often granulated. In some cases of abscess in the lachrymal sac, be- fore the integuments give way, the subjacent bone becomes diseased in consequence of the pressure of the confined matter; portions are necrosed, and after their separation, considerable deformity is pro- duced. The exfoliation is often very tedious, and is attended with discharge of foetid thin fluid from the nostril, and from the ill-conditioned lachrymal fistula. Fistula lachrymalis is often merely one of the symptoms of disease in the bones of the nose, with obstruction of the nasal duct,—as in patients who have suffered from mercury. Treatment.—In the treatment of epiphora or ble- norrhaea—that is, chronic collection of a mucous fluid in the lachrymal sac, with weeping of the eye a primary object of attention is the state of the general health.

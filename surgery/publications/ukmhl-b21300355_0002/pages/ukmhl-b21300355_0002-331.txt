AFFECTIONS OF FINGEKS. 321 rnation ensuing, followed by sloughing of the ten- dons, or by rigidity of the part. From my expe- rience of the unfavourable consequences of incision, I should not again adopt such a proceeding. Setons have been passed through the swellings, but I can- not attest either their efficacy or their safety. Exostoses of the phalanges of the fingers are rarely met with. Sometimes bony enlargement occurs, in- volving many of the phalanges along with several of the metacarpal bones. In such cases, both hands are often similarly diseased, and other parts of the osseous system also affected. When the tumour is limited to one or two fingers of one hand, then, to get rid of the deformity and inconvenience, the pa- tient may desire its removal. The whole of the bone affected should be taken away, lest the disease be re- produced. Spina ventosa, acute or chronic, more frequently the latter, is sometimes met with in the metacarpal bones, or in the phalanges. The same treatment is applicable here, as that already detailed in regard to similar affection of the lower jaw. Amputation above the tumour may sometimes be necessary. The hands of infants are sometimes found de- formed, turned inwards as the feet are more fre- quently. Some of the carpal bones are compressed, from the awkward position of the limb, but become properly developed, if the parts are placed in their proper position as soon as the deformity is observed, and kept so. But the displacement is unmanage- PART II. x

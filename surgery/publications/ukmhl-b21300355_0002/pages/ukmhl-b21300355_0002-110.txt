DISEASES OV THE EYE. 100 consists of mere thickening of the conjunctival cover- ing from lymph having been effused; it impairs vision, but does not destroy it, for the affected part remains semitransparent. In strumous constitutions specks of the cornea are often accompanied with ulceration of the edges of the palpebral, and destruction of the ciliseâ€”the oph- thalmia tarsi. The margins of the eyelids are red and slightly tumid, and discharge an acrid fluid ; the ciliae are matted together; pustules form at their roots ; the bags which secrete them are laid open and destroyed, and they consequently fall out. The affection is often of long duration, and may be in part prolonged by vitiated secretion from the mei- bomian glands. During its progress it excites very considerable irritation in the whole eye, and, as has been already stated, opacities of the cornea not un- frequently accompany it. Veins become enlarged, and varicose on the conjunctiva, as also their minute ramifications on the clear part of the ball; small red- dish lines appear on the cornea, and around them is " diffused a thin, milky, or albuminous humour," which destroys its transparency at that part. Such spots may be solitary or numerous, and darken the cornea either partially or entirely. They are always surrounded with a fasciculus of enlarged veins. In elderly people, a dim, opaque ring, of a greyish colour, sometimes encircles the margins of the cornea, and is called Arcus Senilis. Sometimes the cornea presents a spotted appear- ance ; and this state of the organ is generally attended witli obstinate inflammatory action in the part. The

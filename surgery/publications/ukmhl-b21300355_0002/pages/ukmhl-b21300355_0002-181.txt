But a piece of card or soft leather is more convenient; this having been cut of the proper size and form, is laid down on the fore- head, the part representing the root of the nose rest- ing between the eyebrows. It is held firmly by an assistant, whilst the surgeon traces its dimensions with a knife carried deeply through the integuments. The pattern is then removed, and the flap dissected down, being laid hold of with the finger and thumb, or with a hook. It is then twisted round, the lower part being left undisturbed. This attachment at the root of the nose may be narrow and long, so as to admit of its being twisted, but it is not to be left thin; it must embrace the fibres of the corrugator supercilii, so that its vascular supply may be abundant. The incision on the side to which it is proposed to make the turn may be brought a little lower than the other, so as to facilitate the twisting. After bleeding has ceased, the flap is applied to its new situation, and retained in apposition with the raw edges of the trun- cated organ by a few points of interrupted or convo- luted suture ; a little oiled lint is placed in the nostrils to support the flap, but no other dressing should be applied. To cover the part with pledgets of lint smeared with ointment, and adhesive strap, can an- swer no good purpose, and the subsequent removal of such might endanger the adhesion. The attention must now be directed to the wound of the forehead; the lower part is easily brought together, and re- tained by a stitch ; thereby the whole surface is

DISEASES OF THE EY1(51 • vity remains free of all disease,—and is attended with some obstruction to the passage of the tears in their natural course, on account of the eyelids becoming swollen, from an extension of the inflammation. The morbid action resembles erysipelas in its nature, and usually terminates in unhealthy suppurations ; thin purulent matter lodges in the opened out cellular membrane, a soft boggy tumour is formed, and the superimposed integuments become of a bluish colour, as in the case of other scrofulous collections. Though the affection is at first unconnected with the lachrymal sac, this organ may ultimately be in- volved. It may become the seat of a like unhealthy inflammation, and matter may consequently form within its cavity; or, on account of the pressure from copious deposit in the external parts, the pa- rietes of the sac may ulcerate before outward evacua- tion takes place from the anterior part of the swell- ing. Thus, the cavities of the lachrymal sac, and of the external abscess, will communicate with each other. If, after an external aperture has been made either by nature or by art, any doubt exist as to whether the sac is involved or not, such doubt will soon be removed by dexterous use of the probe. In the treatment of this affection, it will be neces- sary, at the commencement, as in all other local in- flammatory diseases, to attempt the accomplishment of resolution, by attention to the general health, local abstraction of blood, and warm fomentations. When matter has formed, it ought to be evacuated as soon as possible by a small incision, as there will then be

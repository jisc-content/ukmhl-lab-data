DISEASES OF THE SCALP. 58 such an extent, or in such a situation, as to forbid any attempt at removal of the growth. Encysted tumours frequently form in the scalp, and, if undisturbed, become large ; they seldom occur singly. The disease appears in many cases to be hereditary, and it frequently happens that several members of one family are at the same time afflicted with it. The contents of the tumours vary as to consistence, but are generally atheromatous. The cyst is thick, and loosely connected with the sur- rounding cellular tissue; but as the tumour increases, the adhesions often become firm and intimate, more especially towards the skin. When the tumour is of small size, it is unnecessary to adopt any preparatory measures for its removal, not even to shave the scalp. The swelling is transfixed, in the direction of the fibres of the occipito frontalis, by means of a curved sharp-pointed bistoury, and its internal structure is exposed by the knife being carried upwards. The soft contents are evacuated, and the sac is easily ex- tracted by means of common dissecting forceps. The integuments are then laid down and retained in ap- position, no sutures being necessary, and in many cases the wound heals by adhesion ; sometimes a small coaguluin forms between the edges of the wound, and is detached some days afterwards; then slight suppuration ensues. In larger tumours, how- ever, a straight and narrow knife is perhaps the most convenient instrument for accomplishing re- moval. The part is transfixed, and in most cases it is necessary to take away an elliptical portion of

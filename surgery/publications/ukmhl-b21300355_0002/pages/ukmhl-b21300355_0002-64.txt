â–  5 \> DISEASES OF THE SCALP. perforation in the dead bone may be made at dif- ferent points down to the living parts, with the view, of expediting the process. Exfoliations are sometimes retained by surrounding granulations over- lapping their edges and confining them in their situ- ation ; or are fixed by atmospheric pressure, after separation has taken place from the parts underneath by the action of the absorbents, in the same way as a boy's leathern sucker becomes firmly fastened to the stone to which it is applied. In such circum- stances a small screw may be fixed into a perforation carefully made in the bone, and thus the dead part may be lifted out without pain or difficulty, when otherwise it might have lain for many weeks, keep- ing up the discharge. The powdered red precipitate of mercury may be occasionally sprinkled on the parts surrounding the dead portion, in order that the granulations embracing it may be destroyed, and the part more completely detached. The general health must be all along carefully attended to. Sar- saparilla with guiac, sassafras, mezereon, &c. is often useful, more especially if pains in other parts con- tinue to annoy the patient. Under such medicines he in general improves very rapidly in appetite, flesh, and strength. The scalp is sometimes, though rarely, the seat of malignant ulcer. In the early stage the ulceration is not of great extent, and affects only the soft parts ; perhaps it is confined at first to the common integu- ment, but is extremely apt to extend to the deeper layers which invest the cranium, and even to the

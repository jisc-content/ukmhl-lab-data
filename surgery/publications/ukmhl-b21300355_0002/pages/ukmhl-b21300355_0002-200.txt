190 CONGENITAL DEFICIENCIES. If the flap is short and free, without osseous pro- jection, the operation may be concluded at once thus. The edges are pared on both sides, and the parts brought together as in single harelip, the small in- tervening flap not preventing apposition below. One pin is passed at the prolabium, the other traverses the flap. When the bone projects, and the flap is long, the parts may be rendered favourable for the operation at two different times (mentioned above) by gentle and continued pressure; the osseous prominence being reduced, so as to restore the natural position of the soft parts. When, as not unfrequently occurs, there is projec- tion of the bone, and the soft and hard parts seem to be incorporated with the apex of the noseâ€”when, in short, little or no intermediate flap exists, the pro- truding portion of bone may be removed by cutting forceps down to the level of the palatine arch ; and then the soft parts can be brought together by one operation, as for single harelip. In some cases, when the space between the pala- tine plates of the superior maxillary bone is wide, it may be necessary, by mechanical contrivance, fit- ting on metallic apparatus possessing a strong spring, to approximate the bones before attempting to unite the lip. This is required, and the cases must be very rare, only when the soft parts could not be otherwise brought together; when they can be united, the equable and continued pressure of the soft parts will have the effect of gradually approximating the hard.

192 CONGENITAL DEFICIENCIES. pended. The size of the fissure is various, and de- pends very much upon the state of the hard parts. In some cases, the extent of separation is great; in others, the edges are readily approximated by making the patient throw the muscles into action. The latter class admit of operation with a view to permanent union of the edges of the fissure. But it is a proceed- ing which, to insure success, requires not only great steadiness, coolness, and dexterity on the part of the operator, but the utmost courage, submission, and self-denial on the part of the patient. These quali- fications can scarcely be expected in patients under 12 or 14 ; and, by consequence, the operation should not be attempted till after that time of life. Before proceeding to operate, it should first be ascertained that the fissure is not of such extent as to prevent apposition of its edges, without great dragging of the parts ; for, if the separation be wide, temporary apposition may perhaps be effected by ligatures strongly applied, but the apposition will not be complete or accurate throughout the whole fissure, and adhesion will not take place ; the palate will be too much stretched, and will throw off the ligatures by ulceration at the transfixed points of its margins. The patient must be made aware of the nicety of the operation, of the responsibility that rests upon himself, and be exhorted to steadiness and patience. A single exclamation of pain may subvert the whole proceedings. He is seated opposite to a strong light, and made to open the mouth wide ; if necessary, the jaws may be kept separate by a wooden wedge, placed i

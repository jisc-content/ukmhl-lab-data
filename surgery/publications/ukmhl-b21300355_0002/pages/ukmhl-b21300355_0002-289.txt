AFFECTIONS OF EAR. 279 with purulent matter. Abscess of the tympanum it- self discharges long, and large, flabby, soft granula- tions fill up the meatus, different in appearance from tumours which occupy that situation. Ordinary earache—inflammation extending along the meatus externus, and confined to the lining mem- brane—will be relieved by leeching behind the auri- cle, and by assiduous and regular fomentation after- wards. But suppuration is seldom prevented. The abscess may sometimes be opened, with great relief. If deeply seated, the parts are soothed by fomenta- tion and poultice, till spontaneous evacuation of the matter ; this is then to be washed away, from time to time, by the injection of a warm and bland fluid ; the abscess gradually closes, and the discharge slowly dis- appears. In cases of long continued discharge, it is generally impossible to ascertain from what depth the matter comes, and there is always great risk in using means to arrest its flow. The patient must submit to the annoyance. The discharge can be moderated, or altogether suppressed by injections of astringent salts, but the practice is.unsafe, and in most cases unwarrantable. The parts are to be kept clean by fre- quent ablution with tepid water, lime water, or other bland fluids ; and cotton or wool may be worn in the meatus to take up the discharge, and prevent bad effects from cold. Discharge from the external meatus, and about the auricle, is often kept up by irritation in the mouth, in both children and adults ; this should be looked to, and the offending cause removed, if possible.

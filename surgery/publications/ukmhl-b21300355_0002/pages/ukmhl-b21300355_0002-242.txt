WOUNDS OF FACE. l232 sionally benefit has resulted from the external use of the nitrate of silver. Spasmodic action of the muscles of the face, with- out pain, sometimes follow wounds and other injuries of the nerves which supply them ; and sometimes no cause can be assigned for the occurrence. In this affection also I have adopted, with advantage, the application of nitrate of silver to the integuments over the nerves. Division of the parotid duct, or wound of the gland itself, is occasionally followed by the formation of a fistulous aperture, discharging saliva over the cheek. We endeavour to prevent this by accurate union of the recent wound. After the fistula has formed, an opening is to be made from it into the mouth, and kept pervious ; the external aperture is then closed by suture after excision of the smooth edges, or is made to contract by the repeated application of a heated wire ; pressure alone is of little use. All wounds of the face are to be put into the most favourable possible state for healing without suppu- ration, in order to prevent deformity. The twisted suture is best adapted for this purpose ; more accu- rate coaptation being thereby obtained than by the interrupted form. In extensive wounds, the parts may be brought somewhat into their proper position by a few points of interrupted suture ; twisted sutures are then placed in the intervals, and the isinglass plaster is of use in closing those points which may still gape slightly ; in many cases, the greater part of the approximation may be accomplished by isin- glass plaster alone.

309 "WOUNDS OF PALMAR ARCHES. profuse and repeated haemorrhages take place, and are with difficulty controlled. The patient becomes weak and pale. The greater part of the forearm may become involved in the inflammation, termina- ting in infiltration of the cellular tissue, and the for- mation of diffuse abscesses. In the first instance, instead of trusting to pressure, —which almost uniformly disappoints expectation, does not prevent internal bleeding, and leads to a severe form of inflammatory action—it is better at once to enlarge the wound, and tie the wounded vessel above and below the injured point. Thus all bleeding is effectually prevented, and the risk of unfavourable consequences done away with. But such a proceeding is difficult, often almost impossible, and generally fruitless, after inflammatory swelling has commenced. The parts are then full of blood and pus, separated from each other, and changed both in appearance and structure; the vessel is either not visible on account of the infiltration around, or its coats are so diseased as to be incapable of holding a ligature. At any pe- riod, it is unsafe and unwarrantable to dive, pretty much at random, with a sharp needle, amongst ten- dons, nerves, arteries, and veins, with the hope of so including the wounded branch. In some cases of secondary bleeding—if no great inflammatory action has taken place, and no abscesses have formed—the wound may be dilated freely, and compression made on the bleeding point by dossils of lint filling the wound completely, and supported by a bandage. This dressing, retained for some days, often succeeds per- fectly ; permanent obstruction of the vessel, and con-

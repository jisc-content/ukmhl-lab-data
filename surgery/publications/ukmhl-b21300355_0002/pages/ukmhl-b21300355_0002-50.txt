40 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. formerly in use, has been abandoned as cruel and un- necessary. If a wound already exists, but is not sufficiently large, it may be dilated in such a direc- tion as appears most likely to facilitate the after part of the proceedings. The elevation can often be then effected by the judicious application of the lever, its point being carefully placed under the depressed por- tion, and the sound part of the bone being made the fixed point on which the instrument acts. Those depressed portions which are completely detached, must be removed ; but those which adhere, either to the dura mater or to the scalp, ought to be left after having been raised to their former sites, as they will furnish a large contribution towards the filling up of the deficient parietes. Reparation of the scull, when a small portion is removed, or when a single narrow fracture exists, is effected by bone ; but when the opening is large, the deficiency is always repaired by a dense ligament, to which the dura mater and inte- guments adhere. By employing a small saw—repre- sented in both ancient and modern surgical works— so as to widen the fracture, or remove a projecting corner of bone, sufficient room may be obtained for the introduction of the lever. In old subjects, the bones are brittle, and a small corner may be readily removed by plyers, or cutting forceps, so as to allow the depression to be raised. But it may be necessary, in order to elevate portions that are wedged under the sound part of the cranium, to take away a considerable portion of the latter. One or more circular pieces must be removed by the tre- phine, and it may perhaps be necessary to cut out the

Inflammation took place, externally and internally, and the passage of air was obstructed; abscess form- ed, and the matter was evacuated spontaneously; extensive ulceration ensued ; the cartilage and bone became affected, portions of them separated, and a bloody foetid sanies flowed from the nostrils.

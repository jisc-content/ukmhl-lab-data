The voice was considerably impaired, and breathing much impeded, inspiration being difficult and attended with a loud wheezing noise.

There was no pain or uneasiness in the larynx or trachea. The disease was of three years' duration. A seton had been introduced, but effected no diminution, and rendered the tumour more dense and less movable than formerly. I surrounded the lower part of the tumour by two semicircular incisions, and, dissecting cautiously beneath its base, detached it from its more loose connexions, not interfering with the central portion and its connexion to the trachea. During the progress of the dissection, the blood flowed most profusely from both arteries and veins, but was re- strained by securing the former with ligature, and compressing the latter with sponge. An armed needle t was then passed through the centre of the tumour, as close to the trachea as possible, and its remaining attachment enclosed by the separate portions of the ligature firmly applied. Every thing proceeded fa- vourably. The tumour soon came away ; the wound

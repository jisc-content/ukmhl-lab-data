9 INJUKIES OF THE HEAD. other circumstances is incision warrantable, as un- healthy, troublesome, and tedious suppurations are sure to follow. Of Concussion.—Concussion, in a greater or less degree, attends most injuries of the head. The functions of the brain are either disturbed or sus- pended ; there is loss of sensibility, of volition, and frequently of the power of motion. The con- fusion of intellect or stunning may disappear in a short time, or may continue, though diminished in intensity, for many days, and even for weeks ; it is seldom, however, that the functional disorder ex- ceeds in duration two or three days, and in general it disappears before that length of time has elapS£d. The stupor is seldom complete ; the patient can per- haps be roused, though with difficulty, so as to an- swer questions by a hurried monosyllable, or make signs in regard to the seat of pain, or for such things as he may suppose himself to be in need of. At first the circulation is weak ; the pulse is fluttering, often intermitting, and scarcely to be felt in the extremi- ties ; the countenance is pale, and the surface cold ; there is occasional vomiting, a symptom which sel- dom occurs when compression of the brain exists, and the breathing is difficult, though scarcely ever stertorous. The pupils are generally contracted, but not uniformly so ; one pupil may be contracted and the other dilated ; at first, they are insensible to light, neither dilating when in darkness, nor contracting further when the light is suddenly increased; not unfrequently a considerable degree of squinting exists.

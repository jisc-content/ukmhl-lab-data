DISEASES OE THE EYE. tioned condition of the parts may continue for a considerable period ; but in other cases purulent matter soon forms within the distended sac ; or, at least, the contents of that organ are so altered in colour and consistence, as to resemble intimately purulent fluid. The secretion may or may not be pus, probably it is not in some cases ; but as the decision of this point is unimportant practically, the description of it as purulent can scarcely be objected to. In most cases, when the puncta either are or become clear, no suppuration, or deteriora- tion of mucus into fluid like pus, occurs; merely chronic distension of the sac continues, the patient being able to avert incited action, by occasionally squeezing out the contents, and thereby removing tension. There is merely Epiphora ; or, as it is other- wise called, Blenorrhsea, or Stillicidium lachryma- rum. The last term is by some applied to increased lachrymal secretion, without affection of the sac, the tears being secreted more quickly than the puncta can carry them away, and consequently running over on the cheeks and excoriating the surface, and producing an irritable condition of the eye. The simple epi- phora may be of long duration, yet the parts are extremely liable to assume inordinate action, in con- sequence of slight injury, or exposure to cold ; thus suppuration will ensue. When purulent matter forms, fluctuation becomes more distinct, the pain increases, and there is slight headach and fever. The integuments inflame more and more, and, if the case is neglected, ultimately PART ii. e

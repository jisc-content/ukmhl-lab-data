DISEASES OF THE EYE. 114 by means of forceps, and removed either with the knife or with scissors. The aqueous humour imme- diately escapes, and in most cases the chrystalline lens and vitreous humour are also discharged. The eye consequently shrinks, and retracts within the palpebral. The cut margins of the cornea soon assume a reddish appearanceâ€”they form granula- tions, the wound contracts gradually, and ultimate- ly closes ; but the eye is necessarily much shrunk, and totally useless as an organ of vision. Gene- rally suppuration takes place, causing complete dis- organization of the parts ; and the preceding inflam- matory action may be so intense, and attended with so much constitutional disturbance, as to require active measures for its moderation. Deformity may be in a great measure removed by adapting an arti- ficial eye to the shrivelled remains of the natural one. When it is necessary to remove only a small part of the cornea, the aqueous humour alone escapes, and during the cure of the wound the patient not unfre- quently enjoys a tolerable degree of vision ; but after the wound has completely closed, vision is again lost completely. Hydr ophthalmia also is a disease in which little hope can be entertained of materially benefiting the patient. In the slighter cases, in which no very annoying symptoms accompany the affection, vision may be improved by the use of optical instruments; and mercurial preparations may be employed in mo- deration, with the view of promoting absorption of

Though not uncommon in the lower jaw, it is rare in the upper. I have only met with one instance of it in the latter situation. The patient was a female, about twenty-five years of age. The tumour was of four years duration, and its origin was attributed to a severe bruise of the cheek. The teetli had loosen- ed soon after the injury, and the disease commenced in the gums. When she applied, there was a hard prominent swelling in the forepart of the maxillary bone, and a firm tumour involved the gums on the same side, and a part of the hard palate : the disease had made much progress during the previous six months, but was evidently not of so malignant a na- ture as the soft tumours which originate in, or early involve, the cavity of the antrum : at first it had been of the nature of epulis.

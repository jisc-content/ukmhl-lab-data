LIGATURE OF AXILLARY. .'304 ing parts as those for ligature of the axillary artery; and besides, the vessel is tied farther from the dis- eased part. The axillary artery may be tied on account of wounds of it, either immediately upon the infliction of the injury, or some time afterwards. The dissec- tion is difficult, the vein being much in the way, and the vessel surrounded by nerves, and intimately con- nected with them by dense cellular tissue. The artery is more involved at the middle portion of the axilla than at the superior and inferior ; at that point, too, the cephalic vein, as well as the axillary, impedes the operator. To reach the upper portion of the artery, much muscular substance must be divided. An extensive incision, in the course of the vessel, is made through the integuments. The pectoralis major is got through by separation and division of the fibres, the incision in it being made with as little cross-cutting as pos- sible. Part of the pectoralis minor, probably the superior half of the muscle, must also be cut. The parts are then exposed, the vein to the inner side of the artery, and the nerves interlaced. The vessel is carefully isolated at one point, and there secured. It is almost impracticable to reach the middle por- tion of the axillary—supposing the vessel to be divided into three equal portions—without injurious interference with the nerves. If operating with the view of tying the extremities of the vessel wounded at this point, the probability is that the nerves have been divided along with the artery, and then the 1

247 DISEASES OF "WINDPIPE. but more or less detached, particularly at its inferior extremity, by a quantity of vitiated mucus which in- tervenes between it and the mucous surface and is intimately adherent to the latter. The mucous mem- brane is also slightly elevated by effusion into the subjacent cellular tissue. By the formation of false membrane, the symptoms may be so much increased as to cause speedy disso- lution ; but in many cases the patient's strength is not altogether exhausted, and the extraneous sub- stance by its irritation causes frequent and violent attempts to expectorate, by which the lymph is not unfrequently expelled either entire or in irregular portions; the relief thereby afforded, though consider- able, is in general temporary, for lymph is speedily redeposited, and the patient succumbs. It has been al- ready stated that a portion of the false membrane is usually detached from the lining membrane of the canal, and from this the existence of the membrane is in general easily recognised ; for on its being moved by the passage of air in the canal, a peculiar sound is frequentlyaudible,andhas been compared to that made by the movement of the valve or clapper of a pump. When perceived during inspiration, it indicates that the membrane is detached at its superior extremity ; when in expiration, that the separation has occurred inferiorly. A fatal termination may suddenly take place, in consequence of the detached extremity being so displaced by the passage of the air as to form a complete valve, obstructing respiration, and causing death by suffocation.

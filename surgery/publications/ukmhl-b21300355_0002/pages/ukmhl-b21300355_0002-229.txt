219 SPINA VENTOSA OF THE JAW. subsequent irritation has subsided, the cause must be removed ; carious teeth or stumps are not to be taken away during the inflamed state of the parts, but after the pain and inflammation have subsided in consequence of free evacuation of the purulent matter. After these have abated, and not till then, the offending bodies are to be extracted, both in order to procure a more speedy and effectual cure, and with a view to prevent recurrence of the disease. If a portion of the jaw has become^necrosed, the sequestra are to be extracted as soon as they become loose, and openings and counter-openings must be made, according to circumstances, so as to afford a free outlet to the matter. Spina Ventosa of the Jaw often originates, as before mentioned, in a small cyst at the root of a decayed or dead tooth. The disease is usually situ- ated on one side of the lower jaw ; but sometimes oc- curs in the upper, and is at first unconnected with the cavity of the antrum. Inflammation has taken place in the internal structure of the bone; matter is secreted by the medullary vessels, and collects in the cancellated texture. Purulent formation advances, the cancelli are broken down, the external laminae of the jaw are extended, protruded, and attenuated ; and then the internal cavity enlarges, containing pus, perhaps mixed with other fluids, and with disorgan- ized particles of bone. Sometimes the collection pro- ceeds slowly, and the expansion of the bone is gra- dual and uniform ; in other instances, the swelling rapidly attains a large size. As the disease advances,

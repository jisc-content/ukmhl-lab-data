Lace- rated wounds, and such as penetrate into the interior of the eyeball, cannot be expected to heal without morbid action having been excited : inflammation must be anxiously looked for, and actively combated as soon as it appears. When a foreign body lodges in the wound, it must be early removed. But in certain cases it is imprudent to attempt extraction of foreign matter ; as when a small shot, or other minute substance, has lodged in the interior of the eyeball. In such circumstances we can only adopt such mea- sures as prevent and subdue morbid excitement. The organ may remain little disturbed for a short period, but violent inflammatory action soon occurs, and, though subdued for a time, again breaks forth, and, by its successive attacks, may ultimately destroy the eyeball. Frequently all endeavours to avert unto- ward results are unavailing, and the functions of the organ are more or less impaired—the cornea may become opaque, the iris may protrude, the pupil may become irregular, contracted, or obliterated—the crys- talline lens may lose its transparency, amaurosis may occur from injury of the retina, the humours may be evacuated, and the eye sink in its socket.

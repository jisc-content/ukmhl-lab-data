177 LIPOMA OF NOSH. served, that, when the columna has been destroyed, the lip falls clown, is elongated, and becomes tumid, particularly at its middle, so that borrowing a por- tion from it materially ameliorates the condition of the part; and the cicatrix being in the situation of the natural fossa, is scarcely observable. The alee of the nose, deficiencies in the upper, anterior, or lateral parts of the organ, in the fore- head, &c. may be supplied from the neighbouring integument, on the same principle as the preceding repairs. The integuments covering the apex and alse of the nose are sometimes opened out in texture by interstitial deposit, forming a lipomatous tumour, lobulated, discoloured, and intersected by fissures. The sebaceous follicles are enlarged enormously, so as to admit the point of a quill. Turgid veins ramify superficially ; and the surface is of a reddish blue or a purple colour, varying its hue from time to time, according to the state of the health, and the changes in the circulation. The enlargement often attains great magnitude, producing much deformity. Vision is obstructed, and the introduction of food, both solid and liquid, interfered with : the lobes tumble into the wine-glass, spoon, and cup, and sometimes they are so elongated as to require being pulled aside in order to uncover the mouth. Breathing is also im- peded more or less, by encroachment on the nasal orifices. The disease may be often attributable to hard living ; but many, not intemperate, labour under it. PART II, M

INJURIES OF THE HEAD. so serious an injury has taken place : and again, in cases where dissection has shown most extensive fracture of the temporal, sphenoid, and rethmoid bones, no blood had issued from their external open- ings. Fracture of the base of the scull generally proves fatal, but many cases are met with in which there is reason to believe that it has taken place, and yet the patients recover, perhaps with partial para- lysis. Of this I lately met with a good example in the case of a girl seven years of age, whose head had been squeezed between a wall and the back of a cart, and thereby considerably flattened. She lay insensible for several days, with all the symptoms of compression, and with blood flowing in small quan- tity from the nose, mouth, and right ear. An ex- tensive abscess formed over the right temporal bone. She ultimately recovered, but remained affected with paralysis of the right side of the face and amaurosis of the left eye ; sensation in the paralysed parts be- ing quite perfect. Fractures of the upper part of the cranium are generally attended with displacement to a greater or less extent, and with wound of the cranial coverings. The size of the depressed portion, the depth to which it is displaced, and the extent of wound, will depend upon the nature and intensity of the force applied. Fractures, with depression of a considerable portion of one of the flat bones, are sometimes unattended with any alarming symptoms. The effects of the injury soon disappear, and even in cases where the depression has been very considerable, and where,

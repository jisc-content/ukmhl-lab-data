COLLECTIONS IN THEC^E. 318 nodules ; and a large shell is so formed, partially in- vesting the sequestrum. This affection is termed scrofulous nec?'osis. Or the bone does not die, but is exposed and ulcer- ated superficially; or a considerable cavity forms in its interior, apparently from suppurative degenera- tion of the cancellated structure. The secretion from the ulcerated surface is thin, acrid, and often bloody; and new osseous matter is studded around. The surface of the rest of the bone is unusually open in texture, whilst its interior is condensed, and the can- celli are filled with lardy substance. This form is called scrofulous caries. Abscesses in the soft parts form one after another, several of the bones are often affected at the same time, superficial abscesses and affections of the joints and bones often take place in other parts, and the patient grows weaker and weaker. Whilst the surgeon attends to the general health, and employs palliative local applications, nature fre- quently effects a cure. The sequestrum ultimate]} separates,, or the ulceration gives way to more healthy action. New bone fills up the cavity, the redundant osseous deposit gradually diminishes, the openings in the integuments close, and the swelling- subsides. In some rare cases, it may be necessary to take away the offending part, in consequence of the health alarmingly declining. Collections in the thcc<e of the flexor tendons are occasionally met with. Those of the thumb and fore- finger are most frequently affected. The swelling

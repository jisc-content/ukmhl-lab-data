32 INJUltlES OF THE HEAD. the scalp around the wound. He had felt pain in the right ear, and in the forehead whilst stooping, for some days after the accident. No blood had ever escaped from the ear. A fit of shivering occurred on the night following the injury, but never returned. He soon recovered completely. I subjoin a case of an opposite description. A coachman was knocked down, late on a Saturday night, and fell with his head on the corner of a stone at which masons had been recently working. After being carried to his lodgings, he recovered from the stupor produced by the combined causes of liquor and blows; and next morning he went to have his head dressed by an apothecary, who extracted a frag- ment of a stone with difficulty from the wound of the head. The patient then drove a party to church, and probably drank some more whisky during the day. He afterwards felt indisposed, and was seized with sickness and shivering in the afternoon. On Monday he was in a violent fever, and I saw him in the evening. He had been delirious, but was now lying in a state of stupor. There was a hole in the right parietal bone, capable of admitting the point of the little finger, and many loose fragments of bone were felt lying on the dura mater; a trephine was applied, and numerous spiculae removed. Afterwards the circulation became much excited, he was bled copiously, and antimony was exhibited in nauseating doses, but he died early on Wednesday morning. On dissection, there were found marks of violent inflam- matory action on the surface of the hemispheres.

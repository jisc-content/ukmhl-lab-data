TltACHEOTOMY. 263 When the object of the operation is to relieve re- spiration, impeded by disease in the superior part of the canal, a silver tube, of convenient curve, length, and calibre, is introduced into the wound imme- diately on the knife being withdrawn, and secured by tapes attached to the rings at the orifice of the tube, and tied round the neck. Frequently a violent fit of coughing, alarming to the patient, follows the intro- duction, in consequence of some blood having entered the trachea. But on the ejection of some frothy mucus, mixed with blood, the patient becomes quiet and tran- quil, breathes easily, and feels composed and relieved. Theform of the tube—the calibre gradually increasing from below towards the orifice—completely prevents any farther ingress of blood, by the uniform compres- sion which it makes on the edges of the wound. The secretion of mucus in the trachea is increased by the presence of the foreign body, but the patient easily frees himself from its annoyance, being instructed to place his finger on the orifice of the tube, so as to nar- row the aperture, when he wishes to cough and expec- torate. Mucus, however, is apt to adhere to the inner surface of the tube, and thereby obstruct breathing ; and to prevent this, it is necessary occasionally to in- troduce a feather, or a probe wrapped round with lint, for some hours after the operation ; the attend- ance of an assistant may be necessary for this pur- pose, but the patient readily undertakes the duty himself, on being made aware of its necessity. A double tube has been recommended, to facilitate the

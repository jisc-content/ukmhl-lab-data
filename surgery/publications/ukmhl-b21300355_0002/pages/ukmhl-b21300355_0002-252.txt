W OUNDS OF NECK. 242 the oesophagus was also cut across, but the extent to which it had receded was not ascertained. A large quantity of blood had been lost; attempts were made to bring the parts together, but were aban- doned on account of the violent dyspnoea which was induced. It was also endeavoured to pass an elastic gum tube into the gullet, from the nose and from the mouth ; but this also failed. He was kept alive by nutritious enemata. On the second day after the accident, the cut extremities of the larynx were ap- proximated by two ligatures ; and, the retraction being thereby diminished, it was then discovered that there was another wound between the cricoid car- tilage and the trachea. All ingesta by the mouth passed through the wound. On the fifth day, the ligatures separated, and the larynx again retracted. On the sixth, an elastic gum catheter was passed into the inferior cut extremity of the gullet, and through this nutritious fluids were regularly administered. The wound granulated, and filled up in some mea- sure ; the patient continued to receive both breath and nourishment through tubes introduced down- wards from the wound in the throat. Whilst pour- ing in food, saliva was secreted in the mouth with great profusion. The sense of smelling remained tolerably acute, and he also possessed the power of imperfect whispering articulation.

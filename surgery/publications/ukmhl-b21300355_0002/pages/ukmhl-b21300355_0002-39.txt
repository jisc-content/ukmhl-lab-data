INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 29. from the escape of brain, it was evident that both this organ and its membranes had been seriously in- jured, no bad symptoms have occurred to retard the patient's recovery. Symptoms of compressed brain, however, may generally be expected to attend depres- sion of any considerable portion of bone below its natural level. Still the brain may become accustomed to the pressure, and the symptoms may gradually subside without surgical interference. And if the indications of compression are not very alarming, the coma not very profound, a little delay is allowable, means being taken to avert inflammatory action: for danger is not imminent, the cure may not be expe- dited by operative aid, and there is chance of injury resulting from rash interference. But it is in general necessary to remove the cause of the symptoms, to elevate the depressed bone, and take away those portions which may be detached. It has been said that we must be regulated in our proceedings very much by the existence or not of external wound ; that we must be cautious in cutting down upon fractures of the cranium where there is no wound, and so converting a simple into a com- pound fracture. In fact, so much is the danger in- creased by the existence of wound, that the symptoms- must be very urgent indeed which would demand division of the integuments in order to admit of examination of the fracture, the application of the trephine, or the elevation of the bone ; whilst, on the contrary, if the fracture is exposed by the accident, very slight symptoms will fully warrant performance 5 1

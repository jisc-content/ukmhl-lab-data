DISEASES OF THE EYE. 72 sage are tubes and styles. The tubes are made either of silver or gold, of equal calibre through- out, and of the same length as the passage. At first their size is necessarily small, but is afterwards increased so as to fully distend the duct. For some time after their introduction they cause much irri- tation ; this gradually diminishes, and the wound heals over them. But, according to my experience, their effects are not satisfactory. The irritation which they at first occasion generally subsides, but abscess again occurs, with much swelling, and it becomes necessary to remove the foreign body. Again, the tube sometimes becomes obstructed by thickening and concretion of the discharge, and then, when it is necessary to remove it, the process is found to be by no means an easy one ; a free incision is required ; a screw must be fastened into the tube, or when that cannot be accomplished, the body must be laid firmly hold of with strong forceps, and altoge- ther the extraction is always very painful, and often extremely tedious. In short, the practice of introdu- cing tubes does not appear to be founded on sound surgical principles. After extensive and impartial trial of both the tubes and style, I decidedly prefer the use of the latter. On the point of the bistoury being fairly lodged in the lachrymal duct, a probe is passed along it; the knife is then withdrawn, and the passage is gently dilated by the probe. The probe again is followed by the style, which should be made of sil- ver or pewter, of the same thickness throughout, of

22 INJURIES OE THE HEAD. whole thickness. And when an external wound ex- ists, the altered appearance of the bone, with the sloughy state of the detached pericranium, gives evi- dent warning of the mischief which is proceeding internally. The general symptoms of suppuration are the same, whether the collection forms in the substance of the brain, or on its surface. Perhaps the symptoms are not so severe, nor the collection so speedily fatal, when in the substance of the brain, as when situated immediately under the bone, or at the base of the cranium. The external marks already mentioned, are generally indicative of the site of such internal collection, but not uniformly. Formation of matter in the diploe of the scull, in consequence of external injury, is of rare occurrence ; and when it does occur, somewhat similar symptoms and appearances ultimately ensue as when the suppu- ration commences between the bone and dura mater. Sometimes the abscess under the bone is of a chro- nic nature, as in the following case :â€”The patient, a boy, aet. 11, received a blow on the vertex, after which a puffy tumour formed in the injured scalp, and was freely incised. He afterwards became subject to epileptic fits, which were relieved by copious evacua- tion of matter from the wound. Exfoliation of the cranium occurred ; one small sequestrum was sepa- rated, which involved the whole thickness of the bone, and a collection of matter between the dura mater and scull cap was thereby exposed. The con- tained matter was evacuated, and the wound Was

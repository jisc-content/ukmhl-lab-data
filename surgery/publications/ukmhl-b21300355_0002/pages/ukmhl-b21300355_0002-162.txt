152 POLYPUS OP THE NOSE. passes through the cavity, though with difficulty ; in a damp day the obstruction is complete. The tumour evidently increases, comes lower down, and even projects upon the lip. There is watering of the eyes, the lachrymal secretions being prevented from flowing into the nostrils ; and in cases of old standing, the patient is deaf from the pressure of the tumours on the extremities of the eustachian tubes ; this latter symptom is not constant, but de- pends on the position of the tumours. I recollect an old gentleman, an elder of the kirk, afflicted with nasal polypus, who for 30 years had not heard his clergyman, though for 20 years he had attended sermon regularly, and from a sense of duty; on removal of the tumours, hearing was perfectly re- stored. The nose changes its form, is expanded and flat- tened. If the disease is extensive, and particularly if the tumour is malignant, the bones are separated, the eyes are protruded, and pushed outwards ; in- deed the face is so distorted, as to have been com- pared to that of a frog. Even in the benign form, when of long duration, great deformity of the fea- tures is produced, and the patient rendered very un- comfortable. Besides the symptoms already detailed, he suffers from acute pain in the forehead—he breathes loudly, and with difficulty, particularly when asleep—he has lost the sense of smell, and does not relish food or drink—and there is often profuse discharge of a dirty mucous fluid, both ex- ternally and into the pharynx.

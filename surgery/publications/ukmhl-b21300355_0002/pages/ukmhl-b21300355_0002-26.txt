16 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. the most convenient stimulus is ardent spirits, the only objection to its use being, that when imprudently given in large quantities, its effects, though at first stimulant, become sedative : it ought to be employed in small quantities, and at short intervals. Other stimuli, as preparations of ammonia, may be given by the mouth; and much advantage will often be found to follow the employment of a turpentine enema, free motion of the bowels, as well as excitement of the system, being thereby procured. Stimuli, however, should always be used with much caution and prudence, and never unless the train of symptoms, under which the patient is at the time labouring, fully warrant their exhibition ; and when the circulation is restored in the limbs, and is be- coming throughout steady and more natural, all sources of excitement must be abandoned and care- fully avoided, as there is considerable risk of reaction proceeding to too great a height. The patient is to be kept quiet in a darkened room, cold applications made to the head, previously shaved, and free mo- tion of the bowels procured by neutral salts with antimony, or by other purgatives not of an irritating nature, and not given in such doses as to prove vio- lently cathartic. Enemata are in some cases prefer- able, and are always a valuable adjunct, to the em- ployment of purgatives by the mouth ; they procure evacuation from the larger intestines, in which fa?cu- lent matter chiefly accumulates, and, with the addi- tion of assafoetida and turpentine, their salutary effects prove more important than those of mere evacuants i

No farther dressing is required; as previously remarked, no good end can be answered by any application, and the separation of dressing may afterwards be trouble- some ; discharges from the neighbouring passages are retained by it, fcetor is produced, and union inter- rupted. The needles may be removed on the third day ; their ends are cleaned of coagulated blood, and, after being turned gently round on their axis, they are to be cautiously withdrawn, without disturbing the thread or the crust which has been formed about them by the serous and bloody discharge. This often remains attached for some days after removal of the needles, and forms a good protection and bond of union to the tender parts. Some care is after- wards required from the surgeon and patient in rai- sing up the alas, by filling them with lint, and thus compressing the pillar, so as to diminish the cedema- tous swelling which takes place to a greater or less degree in it, and to repress the granulations. It is besides necessary to push upwards the lower part of the column, so that it may come into its proper situ- ation ; and this is done by the application of a small round roll of linen, supported by a narrow bandage passed over it and secured behind the vertex.

200 ENLARGEMENT OF TONSILS. or by incision. The former method is the more dif- ficult, tedious, painful, inconvenient, and dangerous. It is seldom that one ligature, with a simple noose, suffices ; it is necessary to transfix the tumour, and, separating the portions of the ligature, to include the upper and under halves in distinct nooses. The lat- ter method is the preferable. It is not requisite to cut out the whole tonsil, and there is risk in attempt- ing such a measure, but that part only is removed which projects beyond the natural level of the gland. Long curved scissors may be employed, but the straight probe-pointed bistoury is more convenient; and this, to ensure security, may be blunted to within an inch and a half of its point, or rolled so far in lint. To facilitate incision, the tumour is laid hold of by a sharp hook, or what is better, by a vulsellum. Occa- sionally violent attempts at retching occur during the operation ; but there is little pain or haemorrhage. The healing of the sore is hastened by fomentations and mild gargles, and by either stimulating or sooth- ing applications, as circumstances require. Excision of the tonsils is said to produce the bad effect of changing the pitch of the voiceâ€”taking from the high, and adding to the low notes. I have per- formed the operation, as above described, on vocalists, to remedy indistinctness of articulation and constant hoarseness, with the desired effect, and without alter- ing either the pitch, quality, or compass of the voice. No doubt, unpleasant results might follow extensive incisions of the parts, as division of the anterior fold of the palate, and removal of the whole tonsil; but

POLYPUS OF THE NOSE. 157 Lint is preferable to sponge, as being more easily- removed ; the sponge swells, and is apt to produce inconvenience. The plug must be well proportioned to the opening ; if too large, it cannot be lodged in its situation; if too small, it does not fill it, and may be pulled through altogether. It should be smaller, of course, for young subjects and females than in adult males. It may be necessary to close both in this manner, when both are bleeding profusely, or when they communicate through an aperture in the septum. The anterior cavity is then closed with lint, and the haemorrhage, however violent, is com- pletely commanded. The posterior plug is removed on the second or third day by pulling the oral ex- tremity of the thread, and, if need be, by pressing through the nostril with a strong probe. Plugging may be required in epistaxis from other causes, when other means, as cold applied to the surface of the body, and astringent injections to the part, have failed ; the latter remedy is not much to be depend- ed upon. The operation for polypus may be repeated when the parts have recovered, and the pain and discharge ceased. Ere then the patient again finds himself unable to propel air easily through the nos- tril, and on examination, greyish, shining tumours are again visible. The same process of extraction is repeated until all are eradicated. Escharotics may be then applied with some advantage, but must be used with caution, and not of too active a nature ; nitrate of silver and the red oxide of mercury are

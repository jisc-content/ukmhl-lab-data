The slightest difficulty or noisiness of breathing must be closely watched, on the occurrence of any alarming symptom, and energetic measures adopted. Swelling about the wound, producing difficult expec- toration and a diminished current of air, may require the making of a longitudinal opening into the trachea below the wound, and the insertion of a tube. Thus the respiration is quickly relieved ; and the patient is soon able to regulate the size of the aperture ; he is readily taught to apply his finger over part of the orifice of the tube, when it is wished to clear the passage from mucus. The operation should be had recourse to without hesitation or delay ; there is no danger from its performance, but much from its being withheld. If the mouth or gullet are not opened, or only slightly, the patient may be allowed to swallow naturally; though it is true that even the slightest motion of the parts affects the wound injuriously. But, as already observed, immediate union is not to be expected ; swallowing, or attempting to swallow, saliva, produces an involuntary action of the muscles, quite as prejudicial as the swallowing of liquids in large quantity does ; and these motions cannot be prevented, since the patient has no control over them. If the wound of the mouth or gullet is exten-

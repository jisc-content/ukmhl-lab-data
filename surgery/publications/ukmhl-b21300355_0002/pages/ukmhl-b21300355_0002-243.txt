WOUNDS OF NECK. 233 Deep wounds behind the angle of the jaw, and at the lateral and lower parts of the neck, are highly dangerous ; indeed they are almost certainly and im- mediately fatal, as can readily be understood when the large blood-vessels and important nerves are considered which course in these parts, and which must be either wounded or completely divided. The bleeding has in some cases been arrested by imme- diate ligature of the divided extremities of the ves- sel, by firm and permanent pressure, or by pressure at first and ligature of the trunk of the vessel on the recurrence of haemorrhage after the lapse of many days ; of these methods immediate ligature of each extremity is perhaps the safest and best. In lace- rated wounds violent haemorrhage may take place some time after the infliction of the injury, from ulceration or sloughing of a large artery ; in such circumstances either permanent pressure may be re- sorted to, or ligature applied to the vessel above and below the open point. Dissections for the removal of morbid growths in the situations just mentioned must be conducted with much caution, and with a full recollection of the rela- tive anatomy. Unless the tumour is tolerably loose and defined, it ought not to be interfered with. But it is to be recollected that tumours of these parts are bound down by their condensed coveringsâ€”the platysma myoides and cervical fascia ; and that after division of these, the tumour, if not intimately in- corporated with the neighbouring tissues, is loosened, and often can be readily detached.

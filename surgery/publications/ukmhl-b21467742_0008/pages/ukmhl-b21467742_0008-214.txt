By the former one can hope to demonstrate only gross, macroscopic lesions, but even with this in view the examination must be carried out in a careful, systematic manner. In many cases a definite diagnosis can only be arrived at after a further histological or bacteriological investigation. Part I Method of performing a Post-mortem Examination Rules of Procedure, and Precautions to be observed.—Personal.—Before commencing, ex- amine the hands and wrists carefully for recent, wounds. Minute wounds which cannot otherwise be dis- tinguished may be rendered manifest by the localised smarting produced by dipping the hands into weak solutions of ammonia or for- maldehyde ("formalin"). If wounds exist, they must be sealed up with a solution of celloidin in equal parts of alcohol and ether. This is preferable to flexile col- lodion, as it adheres better to the skin. If this be not deemed sufficient protection, thin rubber gauntlets, which must be absolutely water-tight, may be worn. Anoint the hands and wrists with antiseptic vaseline, and wipe the palms so that the knife will not slip. If the hands be cut during an operation, the wound should be encouraged to bleed by squeez- ing it under a stream of cold water, or by suction, then washed with a strong antiseptic and sealed with celloidin. If, soon after, such a wound become hot and tender, indicating infection, it should be opened up, painted with

163 PNEUMONIA—CLINICAL SECTION "acute," "sthenic," "asthenic," " typhoid," or "ataxic," "massive," and so on, find a place in the terminology of pneumonia, pneumonitis, or lung fever. In the valleys of the High Alps in Switzerland a severe form of pneumonia in spring is known as "Stich," or "Alpenstich" {i.e. stitch). The infectiousness of pneumonia was observed by Dunns in 1592. He wrote: "Contagiosum quoque esse inde liquido constabat, quod multi in eadem familia corriperentur." Havicio, writ- ing at Venice in 1613, uses the words "influsso epidemico maligno con qualche immediato con- tagio," of an outbreak "osservato nella terra di Guastalla." The term hepatisation, as applied to one stage of the pathological anatomy of pneumonia, was apparently suggested by Mor- gagni, who in 1761 used the words—" Pulmones compactam ut in hepate est, substantiam habe- bant." Pirri found, in an epidemic at Rome in 1779, "I polmoni degenerate in una sostanza epatica per la sua durezza." According to Hirsch, the earliest records of malignant epidemical inflammation of the lungs in Spain, England, Denmark, and North America belong to the eighteenth century. In France and Switzerland many epidemics of pneumonia occurred during that century, the season of nearly all the outbreaks being winter and spring, and the type of the disease being "typhoid" or "ataxic," sometimes "bilious." The literature of pneumonia grew apace as decade followed decade in the nineteenth cen- tury, which also witnessed the elucidation of the etiology of this genus of disease, for pneu- monia includes many species. Huxham long ago said: "There are very different degrees, I might say species, of this disease, which demand a particular attention and a method of cure peculiarly adapted to each." Epidemics of pneumonia occur from time to time. Huxham described an outbreak of a severe type which visited Plymouth in the latter part of 1745 and the beginning of 1746. A pandemic of the disease overran North America between 1812 and 1825. Laennec described an "Epidemic Pneumonia "as occur- ring among the conscripts of 1814. An out- break commenced in the Akerhus prison, Christiania, on 18th December 1866, lasting until May 1867. Among an average of 360 prisoners in that period, 62 cases occurred, of which 15 ended in death. Dr. L. Dahl and Professor W. Boeck attributed the outbreak chiefly to overcrowding. To the same cause Dr. Bryson ascribed a very remarkable epidemic of pleuro-pneumonia which broke out in some ships in the Mediterranean fleet in 1860. Dr. Thoresen of Eidsvold, Norway, met with a local outbreak of " croupous pneumonia " in a single row of cottages near some glassworks in the summer of 1869, when the town was otherwise almost free from the disease. In the spring of 1874 an epidemic of "sewer-gas pneumonia," as it was aptly called, prevailed at East Sheen, Mortlake, London, S.W., in connection with the opening of a ventilator in a main sewer. The cases occurred in a first-class boys' school facing the road iinder which the sewer ran. During the summer of the same year pneumonia, apparently traceable to sewer-gas poisoning, prevailed in Dublin. It was described under the name of " pythogenic pneumonia" in a paper written conjointly by the late Dr. Thomas Wrigiey Grimshaw, C.B., afterwards Registrar- General for Ireland, and by the present writer. In the autumn, winter, and spring of 1874-1875 an epidemic of pneumonia swept over the south- western counties of England (Wynter Blyth). A serious outbreak at Middlesbrough-on-Tees in 1888 formed the subject of an admirable report by Dr. Edward Ballard, Inspector of the Local Government Board, England. The out- break lasted for twenty-four weeks, comprised about 1000 cases, and caused 369 deaths. In April and May 1890 there was an outbreak at Scotter, in Lincolnshire, in which 22 deaths occurred among 32 known cases, a mortality of 69 per cent. This epidemic was admirably described by Dr. T. B. Franklin Eminson, medical officer of the Scotter district of the Gainsborough Union, and it was also specially investigated by the Local Government Board inspector, Dr. Parsons, who attributed the out- break to sewer - air emanations and simple contagion conjointly. In the early spring of 1893 epidemic pneumonia attacked the town- ship of Yeadon, Yorkshire, with a population of 7500. Dr. C. J. Russell M'Lean, D.P.H., medical officer of health for the township, observed 35 undoubted cases, of which 24, or 71'4 per cent, occurred in the months of March and April. There were 13 deaths, the case mortality being as high as 37 "14 per cent. Dr. M'Lean cites two series of cases—3 in each instance—in which the disease was apparently communicated from person to person. A startling fact as to the frequency and mortality of pneumonia is brought out by Dr. Hector Mackenzie, of St. Thomas's Hospital, who finds that in a population of 30,000,000 in England and Wales, at least 220,830 persons are annually affected with pneumonia, and that 31,950 persons annually die from this disease, the mortality being thus 14-5 per cent of those attacked. In the year 1898 the death-rate from pneumonia in England and Wales was 1323 per million males in the population, and 947 per million females. Tables 20 and 22 in the Sixty-first Annual Report of the Registrar- General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages in England (1898) show that the annual death- rate per million from pneumonia among males, which had been as low as 1089 in the year 1881, rose with a bound from 1206 in 1889 to 1731 in 1890, and still further to 1798 in

Husemann as- signed to this pig- ment the formula CigHj^O, but Ar- naud has more re- cently maintained that carotin, as it exists in the vegetables which it colours, con- tains no oxygen, and assigns to it the formula C.26H38. T h e absence of nitro- gen, at any rate, appears to be a feature common to all the members of the lipochrome group. A lipochrome which has received considerable at- tention, and which has a wide dis- tribution in the animal kingdom, is tetronerythrin, which was first isolated by Wiirm from the red areas around the eyes of certain birds, and has been found by Halli- burton to be the red pigment met with in the skin, blood, and hypo- derm of the lob- ster and allied Crustacea. Lutein, the pig- ment of the cor- pora lutea, was first described by Thudichum, who thus laid the foundation of the study of this group of sub- stances.

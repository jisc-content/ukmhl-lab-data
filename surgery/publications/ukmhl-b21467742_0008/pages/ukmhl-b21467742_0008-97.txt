77 PHYSIOLOGY—NUTRITION OF THE TISSUES accurate observations are desired is it necessary to analyse the faeces and sweat. B. Metabolism of Fats. — Proteins contain nearly three and a half times as much carbon as nitrogen, and hence, when they are broken down, for each grm. of nitrogen excreted, 3*4 grms. of carbon are given off. The carbon is chiefly excreted from the lungs as carbon dioxide, and in this form it may be collected and estimated. Any excess of carbon excreted, over the 3"4 times the amount of nitrogen given off, must be derived from the fats of the body or from the fats and carbohydrates taken in the food. Any carbon retained in the body, apart from that in proteins, is stored ultimately as fat. Since carbon constitutes 76*5 per cent of fats, the amount of fat is calculated by multiplying the carbon by 1"3. The following tabular example of an investi- gation of the metabolism may be given :— Intake in Grams. Output. C. N. C. N. Proteins 100 54 16 Fats . 100 76 Carbohydrates . 400 200 330 16 300 14 Two grms. of nitrogen are retained as protein ; that is, 2 X 6'25 = 12'5 grms. of protein—are being daily laid on. Thirty grms. of carbon are also retained in the body, and of this 3'4 x 2 = 6'8 grms. are combined with the nitrogen in the protein. The remainder, 23-2 grms., go to form fats, the amount of which is 23*2 x 1"3 = 30'16 grms. of fat. 2. Metabolism during Fasting.—When the usual supply of energy in the food is cut off, the animal liberates the energy required by oxidising its own stored material and its tissues. This is shown by the fact that the animal loses weight and goes on excreting carbon dioxide, urea, and the other waste pro- ducts of the activity of the tissues. Several prolonged fasts have been undertaken by men, and, in one or two of these, careful observations have been made by physiologists. It has been found that during the first day or two of a fast, the individual goes on using proteins and fats at something like the same rate as he did while taking food, but that gradually he uses less and less protein each day. This is well shown in the case of Succi, who underwent a fast of thirty days. Day of Fast.

The protein-containing tissues waste more slowly and waste at different rates, the less essential being used up more rapidly than the more essential, which, in fact, live upon the former. In cats deprived of food till death supervened the heart and central nervous system had hardly lost weight; the bones, pancreas, lungs, intestines, and skin each had lost between 10 to 20 per cent of their weight, the kidneys, blood, and muscles between 20 to 30, and the liver and spleen between 50 to 70. The rate of waste during a fast depends upon the amount of energy required, and it is there- fore increased by muscular work and by ex- posure to cold. When a man is kept quiet and warm and supplied with water, a fast of thirty days may in some cases be borne without injury. 3. Effect of Feeding.—When food is given to a fasting animal or man, the first effect is to increase the rate of wasting by calling into action the muscles and glands concerned in digestion. The result is an immediate increase in the excretion of nitrogen and carbon, indicat- ing an increased breaking down of proteins and fats. It has been found that in the dog a diet of white bread and butter increased the metabolic processes by an amount equivalent to about 10 per cent of the energy value of the diet. For this reason, to give an animal which is fasting a diet containing just the amount of nitrogen and of carbon which the animal is ex- creting, will not at once stop the loss of weight. Suppose, for instance, that to a fasting animal using daily 30 grms. of the proteins and 160 grms. of the fats of his body, a diet containing these amounts is given, the disintegration of proteins and of fats will at once rise, say, to 50 grms. of protein and 280 of fat. Thus the result will be that, instead of his losing 30 grms. of protein, he will lose only 20 grms. per diem, and instead of 160 grms. of fat, only 120 grms. But, if the diet is sufficient to supply the energy required, in a few days the intake and output will balance, and the indi- vidual is then said to be in metabolic equi- librium, and he neither gains nor loses weight. The following table and Fig. 168 give an idea of how this adjustment of the metabolism is reached:— Day. Intake. Disintegrated. Waste diminished to. Protein. Fat. Protein. Fat. Protein.

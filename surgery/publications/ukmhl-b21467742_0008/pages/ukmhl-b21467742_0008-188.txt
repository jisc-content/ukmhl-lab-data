168 PNEUMONIA—CLINICAL SECTION 3574. Among these were 395 deaths of infants under 1 year of age, 245 of children aged 1 year, 103 of children aged 2 years, 65 of children aged 3 years, and 39 of children aged 4 years —in all 847 deaths of children under 5 years of age, or 23"7 per cent. Between the ages of 5 and 10 years the deaths were 111 ; from 10 to 15 years, 71 ; from 15 to 20, 104 ; from 20 to 25, 124 ; from 25 to 35, 259 ; from 35 to 45, 335; from 45 to 55, 437 ; from 55 to 65, 571 ; from 65 to 75, 463 ; from 75 to 85, 215 ; from 85 to 95, 35 ; and at 95 years of age and upwards, 2. 3. Sex plays an important part in the eti- ology of pneumonia. In England and Wales, in 1898, 1323 males out of every million died of pneumonia, while the corresponding number of females was only 947. Three-fifths of the deaths from this disease registered in Ireland in the five years 1894-1898 inclusive were among males, two-fifths among females. The exact numbers were—males, 2111 deaths, or 59 per cent; females, 1463 deaths, or 41 per cent; total deaths, 3574. Sex, however, is rather an accidental than a positive factor in the etiology, for it is only after the age of 20 years that the disproportion in the deaths among the sexes becomes extreme. Under 1 year old, indeed, out of 395 deaths, only 166 were of females, whereas 229 were of males, the percentages being—females, 42 ; males, 58. Between the ages of 1 and 2 years the respective deaths were —males, 135 ; females, 110; total, 245 ; or, in percentages, males, 55; females, 45. Then comes a change—between 2 and 3 years the sexes die of pneumonia in equal numbers— males, 52 ; females, 51 ; total annual deaths, 103. Between 3 and 4 years the numbers are —males, 30; females, 35 ; total, 65 ; between 4 and 5—males, 18; females, 21; total, 39. The above figures give 847 deaths yearly, of which 464, or 55 per cent, occur among males, 383, or 45 per cent, among females. But between 5 and 10 years, 57 females die of pneu- monia for every 54 males; and between 10 and 15 years, 39 females for every 32 males. Taking these ten years—5 to 15—together, we find that of 182 yearly deaths only 86 occur among males, but 96 among females, the percentages being—males, 47 ; females, 53. After puberty, i.e. 15 years, the sexes draw more and more widely apart as regards the deadly influence upon them of pneumonia, the balance being altogether against the male sex. The explana- tion is obvious. After the critical age of 15 males are more exposed to the other predisposing causes of pneumonia, including over-exertion, over-heating, vicissitudes of atmospheric tem- perature, wet and cold, and, above all, alcoholic intemperance and injury. 4. Season. — Contrary to what one might a priori imagine, pneumonia is not so much a disease of winter as of spring, and of late spring especially. August Hirsch, Professor of Medicine in the University of Berlin, after pointing out that pneumonia, even in its narrowest acceptation of fibrinous or so-called croupous pneumonia, is an anatomical term that includes several inflam- matory processes differing from one another in their etiology, goes on to observe that the prev- alence of the malady depends very decidedly upon certain influences of season and weather. He gives an elaborate table of percentages of pneumonic prevalence in the several months at a large number of places in Europe and America. According to this table, the largest number of cases falls in the months from February to May, the smallest number in the period from July to September. Taking the average for all the places mentioned in the table, it appears that 34'7 per centum of the patients were attacked in spring (March to May inclusive); 29'0 in winter (December to February); 18*3 in autumn (September to November) ; and 18'0 in summer (June to August). The combined percentage for winter and spring is 63'7 ; that for summer and autumn is 36"3. If the number of cases in summer be taken as 1, then autumn has 1*02, winter 1*6, and spring 1'9. Nearly all the re- corded epidemics of pneumonia have occurred in winter and spring. From the foregoing con- siderations, Hirsch confidently concludes that the origin of the malady is dependent on weather influences proper to winter and spring, and more particularly on stidden changes of temperature and considerable fluctuations in the proportion of moistiire in the air. He holds that any ex- ceptionally large number of cases of "inflamma- tion of the lungs " at the other seasons, more especially in summer, has coincided with the prevalence of the same meteorological conditions phenomenally at that season. Netter thinks that the maximal prevalence of pneumonia in March, April, and May is due to an increased virulence of the pneumococcus during those months. In a paper on " Pythogenic Pneumonia," published in 1875 by the late Dr. Grimshaw and the writer, will be found a table, compiled from the returns of the Kegistrar-General for Ireland, which shows the number of deaths from bron- chitis and pneumonia registered in the Dublin Registration District in each quarter of the nine years 1865-1873 inclusive. According to that table, of every 100 deaths from bronchitis, 44 on the average occurred in the first quarter of the year, 22 in the second, only 10 in the third, and 24 in the fourth quarter. Thus the mortality from bronchitis was twice as great in the first as it was in the second quarter, and more than four times greater in the first than in the third quarter. Very different were the facts as to pneumonia —of every 100 deaths from this disease, 32 on the average occurred in the first quarter, 27 in the second, 16 in the third, and 25 in the fourth

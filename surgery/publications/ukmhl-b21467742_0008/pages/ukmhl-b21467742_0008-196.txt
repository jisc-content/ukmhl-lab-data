PNEUMONIA—CLINICAL SECTION 176 long ago pointed out that broncho-pneumonia, or catarrhal pneumonia, was the form of pulmonary inflammation which chiefly occurred in children under five years of age, whereas lobar or fibrinous pneumonia was much more common in children aged between five and fifteen years. Among 98 cases of catarrhal pneumonia, von Ziems- sen reports 67 as hav- ing occurred before the third year; Steffen 52 in 72 cases during the same period. "All ob- servations agree," writes Jiirgensen, " that the first three years of life g are those which are most a often attacked by catar- § rhal pneumonia." Ac- I cording to Osier, lobar o pneumonia has been met £ with in the new-born, £ but he quotes Holt to >, show that of 270 cases ^ of pneumonia in children S, under five years of age, r 75 per cent were bron- g cho - pneumonia. Not- 'I withstanding this pre- ponderance of a catar- ■| rhal exudation in the g pneumonia of childhood, ^ it is certain that the 0 Diplococcus pneumoniae % of Fraenkel plays a part " which is second to none .2 in the etiology of in- % fantile pneumonia. S The atypical symp- » toms and course of 1 pneumonic fever in 3 childhood add greatly ^ to the difficulty of diag- ■c nosis. " Even a phys- a ician of limited experi- 2 ence," wrote Jiirgensen c in 1875, "can easily- ^ recognise pneumonia in ~ adults, but in young >. children this is by no « means an easy matter. t: Everyone who has seen >■ the mistakes of his assist- co" ants in the practice of I a large polyclinic will s confirm this statement. Many children who are reported to have died from 'teething,"worms,' 'convulsions,' etc., have really gone to their graves with an undiag- nosticated pneumonia." Temperature usually runs especially high in patients under puberty—a fact which depends chiefly on the undeveloped mechanism of thermotaxis, or body-heat control, at tender

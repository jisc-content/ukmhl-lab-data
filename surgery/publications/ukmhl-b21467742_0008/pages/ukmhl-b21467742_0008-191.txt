171 PNEUMONIA—CLINICAL SECTION cheek—the "malar flush." The skin is dry and hot, almost burning the observer's hand with its pungent heat. This is the so-called calor mordax, common to pneumonia and scarlatina (Addison) and the hot stage of in- termittent fever. According to Wunderlich, of for the heat lost by conduction. The relaxed or dilated state of the arterioles in pneumonia may also be a cause of calor mordax. After an initial rigor or rigors, the thermo- meter rises briskly and in a few hours to 102° or upwards. It continues to rise until it Leipzig, this pungent heat of skin belongs to those febrile diseases in which the high tem- perature depends chiefly upon increased pro- duction of heat, and in which the hand of the observer is therefore less able to place itself in equilibrium with the temperature of the patient's skin, because the continual over-production of body-heat (exalted thermogenesis) compensates reaches 104° F., or in severe cases 105"8° or more. For some days temperature hovers near these figures, according to the intensity of the case, showing, it may be, daily fluctuations of one or two degrees, the remissions occurring usually in the morning, the exacerbations in the afternoon or at night. Often a sudden and final rise of temperature to a fastigium immedi-

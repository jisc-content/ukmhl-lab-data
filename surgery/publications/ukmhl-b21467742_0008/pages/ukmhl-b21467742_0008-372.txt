PUERPEKIUM, PHYSIOLOGY OF 352 found when lactation was interrupted. Kalten- bach (1877), Spiegelberg (1877), and Hofmeister (1878) all found that sugar was a constant constituent of the urine of lying-in women. To Hofmeier and to Kaltenbach is due the credit of the independent discovery that the sugar was lactose. Spiegelberg regarded the presence of sugar as due to a " resorption diabetes." Ney, whose observations were more extensive than any before or since, embracing 24 preg- nant and 148 lying-in women, also considered that the glycosuria was a form of " physiological diabetes" characteristic of good nurses. M'Cann and Turner carried out an admirable investiga- tion on 100 cases, entailing 1400 analyses of the urine, and their I'esults, which have lately been confirmed by Keim, may be taken as representing the present state of our knowledge on the subject. Lactosuria was observed in every case. As a rule, lactose was present every day after lactation. The quantity varied from '18 to '69 per cent, the average being '35 per cent, i.e. \\ grain to the ounce. The date of the first appearance of lactosuria was found to be as follows :— 1st day (day of labour) 29 per cent. 2nd „ . . . 27 „ 3rd „ . . . 26 „ 4th „ . . . 11 „ 5th „ . . .2 „ The late appearance of lactose on the fourth and fifth days can be explained by the fact that the supervention of lactation is delayed in these cases. M'Cann and Turner give two interesting tables to show the relation between the days when the largest amoimt of sugar is present and the day when milk first appears in the breasts. I have combined these tables to bring out the relation more forcibly. Percentage of cases when Percentage of cases when milk first appears in the largest amount of the breasts. sugar is present. 1st day . 1 2nd „ . . 5 . . 5 3rd „ . . 10 . . 46 4th „ . . 26 . . 39 5th „ . . 26 . . 6 6th „ . . 8 . . 1 7th „ . . 5 8th „ . . 3 9th „ . . 4 10th „ . . 5 nth „ . . 3 12th „ . . 2 13th „ . . 2 14th „ . . 1 Thus the mammary glands being in a state of great activity on the third and fourth days of the puerperium, milk is rapidly formed, and thus distension of the breasts soon occurs; at the same time milk-sugar is absorbed into the blood, owing to the excessive production or diminished outflow of milk, and this excess of milk-sugar is excreted by the urine, and is thus found in largest amount on the fourth and fifth days. In most cases, after this period, the amount of sugar remains constant if the milk be excreted uninterruptedly, and if the daily quantity be not excessive, i.e. if the production and exhaustion be equal. The most important factor in causing increase of lactosuria is distension of the breasts, leading to absorption of milk-sugar into the blood. The same effect is produced by the application of belladonna to the breasts. Next in importance comes the excessive production of milk. But although excess of milk is associated with in- creased lactosuria, the quality of the milk may be inferior, except in regard to its richness in lactose. Hence the indication as to the value of a wet-nurse, which Blot thought could be found in the amount of sugar in the urine, is not to be relied on. Increased lactosuria also follows the reflexly increased secretion brought about by putting the child to the breast. The Bladder.—Although an increased quantity of urine is secreted in the early days of the puer- perium, the bladder usually displays a marked inactivity, with the result that retention of urine is generally met with. The principal reason of this is probably the same as is found operating in reference to the bowels, namely, diminished intra-abdominal pressure and laxity of the ab- dominal walls. A contributory cause is found in the bruised, sore condition of the bladder and urethra, for in the vesical portion of the latter fissures are often produced during labour (Spiegel- berg). This acts in two ways : a reflex inhibition of the bladder muscle is brought about, and the patient dreads to pass water. Recht made ob- servations on 224 women confined at term in the Clinique Baudelocque, and found that the time that elapsed between labour and the first micturition was as follows :— Broadly expressed, the bladder was first emptied : In the first six hours . . in 51 cases, or 22-76 % From the 7th to the 12th hour in 79 ,, „ 35-26 % 13th 18th 46 ., ,, 20-54 % 19th ,, 24th ,, 33 ., ,, 14-75 % 25th ,, 36th „ 15 ,, ,, 6-69 % The separate examination of primiparse and multiparte shows that retention is more pro- noimced in the former. The difference is prob- ably largely accounted for by the greater extent and frequency of local injury or bruising. Primiparse. Multiparse.

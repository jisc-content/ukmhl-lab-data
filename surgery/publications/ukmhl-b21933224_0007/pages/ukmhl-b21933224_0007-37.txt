IMPERFORATE ANUS AND RECTUM. 9 Thus, we have to consider the following groups:—Complete absence of the rectum or a considerable portion of it; a septum between the anus and the rectum ; the existence of a rectum with or without an anus; and lastly, fistulous communications between the rectum and other parts. Fig. 6.—Diagrammatic representation of the different varieties of Im- perforate Anus. A and B represent two common varieties ; in the former the anal depression is developed, in the latter it is absent. In both the sphincter is developed and the rectum e.xtends down to the perineum. In C the rectum ends high up in the pelvis. In D, E, and F there is a fistulous communication with the bladder, urethra, and vagina respectively. When either the anus or the rectum is imperforate there is complete obstruction, and the patient must die unless speedy relief be afforded. When, however, a fistulous communication exists between the rectum and the skin, the bladder, the urethra or the vagina, it allows a certain amount of meconium to escape. The communication, however, is usually very narrow and may be tortuous, and the relief is incomplete, so that death, although somewhat longer delayed, will usually occur unless surgical intervention be practised. A similar result will attend a mere pinhole anus. TREATMENT.—This, as a rule, is unsatisfactory. In the first place the child is only a few hours old and cannot stand prolonged or extensive operation ; in the second place the parts are so small that anything like efficient manipulation is difficult; while in the third place there is more or less complete obstruction and the child's condition is as bad as it can possibly be.

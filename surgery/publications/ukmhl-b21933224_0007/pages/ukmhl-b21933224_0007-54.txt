THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. It must not, however, be expected that this happy result will often occur. Generally the patient will have to go through life with a colotomy opening, but, even so, his condition is much better than before, for he is freed from the constant pain, tenesmus and obstruction, and in many cases he has as much control over the colotomy opening as he had before over the anus. When the stricture is complicated with active ulceration the patient's distress is considerable. Diarrhoea, accompanied by the passage of blood, mucus and pus, is constant and wears out the strength rapidly. Here the passage of bougies will not do much good. In strictures near the anus the use of the screw dilator (see Fig. 9) every second or third day is much better than bougies. If the stricture can be fully dilated by it the ulcers will probably heal. In most cases however the pain is so severe that the surgeon has to make a choice between colotomy and external proctotomy, and in most cases the former will be indicated. In these cases, especially when they are due to syphilis, the surgeon must be prepared to find the sigmoid flexure so bound down in the iliac fossa that left inguinal colotomy cannot be easily performed : if the sigmoid flexure cannot be detached from its adhesions and brought up to the surface sufficiently to enable the bowel to be cut completely across subsequently, the transverse or the ascending colon, preferably the latter, must be opened through a fresh incision (see Part VI., Sec. I., p. 360).

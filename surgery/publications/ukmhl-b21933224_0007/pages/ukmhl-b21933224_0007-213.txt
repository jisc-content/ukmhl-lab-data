CHAPTER XIX. TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER. INJURIES OF THE KIDNEY. The kidney may be injured with or without an external wound. The latter group of ca.ses is the more important from the point of view of treatment. SUBCUTANEOUS LACERATIONS. Injuries to the kidney are most often due to crushes or blows on the abdomen or the loin; they may follow violent lateral flexion of the trunk, and are frequently caused by or associated with fracture of the eleventh or twelfth ribs. They are often complicated with other visceral lesions, such as a fracture of the spine, the ribs or the pelvis, or rupture of the diaphragm, the liver, the spleen, or the duodenum, and this question must be investigated before deciding on the treatment. The most important point as regards treatment is whether the peritoneum over the kidney has been torn, because if so blood and urine will escape into the peritoneal cavity and very seriously complicate the case. The degree of injury to the kidney varies greatly. It may be limited to hfemorrhage beneath the capsule ; there may be extensive laceration of the renal substance, tearing of the renal pelvis, injury to the renal vessels, or complete pulping-up of the organ. From the point of view of treatment, the following classification is perhaps the most useful : 1. Injury to the peri-renal capsule alone, without damage to the true capsule of the kidney or the renal tissue. 2. Bruises of the kidney proper, without rupture of the capsule. 3. Rupture of the kidney, and its proper capsule not extending into the pelvis. 4. Extensive rupture of the kidney substance running into the pelvis, 'i'hese are the ordinary severe cases met with in practice. 5. Extreme damage, the organ being broken up into fragments or entirely pulped up. 6. Laceration of the pelvis or the ureter alone.

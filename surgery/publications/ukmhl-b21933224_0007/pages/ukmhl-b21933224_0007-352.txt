CHAPTER XXXIV. PROSTATIC CALCULI: PROSTATIC TUMOURS: TUBERCULOSIS OF THE PROSTATE. PROSTATIC CALCULI. Prostatic calculi are usually small concretions found in the dilated follicles of the gland, especially when the organ is enlarged. They are small and numerous, and may be collected together to form a considerable mass, consisting essentially of inspissated secretion. True prostatic calculi however, which are probably due to salts deposited on the concretions just mentioned, may be found ; they are composed of phosphate and carbonate of lime, and are brown in colour, comparatively small, often facetted, and of a porcelain- like consistency. Vesical calculi which have escaped from the bladder and become embedded in the prostate, or which lie in the prostatic urethra and go on increasing there, must be distinguished from the true prostatic form. These calculi are readily diagnosed after removal by the fact that their nucleus consists of oxalates, urates, or uric acid, whereas the true prostatic ones do not show these salts; vesical calculi differ also in shape, as they tend to project into the bladder and become elongated and hour-glass shaped. SYMPTOMS.—Prostatic concretions seldom give rise to much trouble; sometimes however they cause symptoms very similar to those of enlarged prostate. They are generally detected either on rectal examin- ation or on passing a bladder sound, by which the rough, characteristic grating of a calculus is detected before the beak of the instrument is in the bladder. When the finger is introduced into the rectum, the stones, which are nearly always multiple, can easily be felt between the sound and the finger. TREATMENT.—In the majority of cases a median perineal section (see p. 309) should be done, the membranous urethra opened, the finger introduced into the prostatic portion, and the calculi removed with forceps.

64 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. dissected up from the submucous and subcutaneous tissues respectively, and the sides of the incisions thus formed are sutured accurately so as to convert them into longitudinal cicatrices, which will serve to pull up the part by their contraction. Catgut sutures should be employed for the mucous membrane, whilst horsehair serves for the approximation of the skin. A suppository is inserted, the prolapse reduced, and a pad of boracic lint is applied outside the anus. The bowels are kept confined until the fourth day, when they should be opened every other day with / Fig. 17.—Method ok Excising portions ui- a Proi.ai-sus Ani. This shows, suiiie- what diagrammatically, how the elliptical or dianiond-shaped pieces are placed. The major portion consists of niucoiis membrane, ihe .skin around the anus only furnishing a small part. The small diagram in the right-liand lower corner is intended to represent the appearance of the prolapse looked at from above after removal of the portions of skin and mucous membrane. It .shows how suture of tliese incisions not only provides longi- tudinal cicatrices but largely diminishes ihe liulk of ihe prolapse. a laxative. The after-treatment is the same as for the simpler cases, and it is important to try the effect of tonics, such as strychnine and the application of the faradic current (see p. 63). Only the horsehair sutures will require to be removed, the catgut ones will become absorbed. Excision of the entire prolapse.—The method just described is only suitable for cases in which the mucous membrane and not the entire wall of the bowel prolapses. It only removes portions of the mucous membrane, and in cases of complete prolapse the muscular wall of the bowel would still tend to come down, being only stopped by the artificial contraction produced about the anal orifice. In cases therefore of complete prolapse of the bowel some more efficacious method is necessary, and the same may be said of

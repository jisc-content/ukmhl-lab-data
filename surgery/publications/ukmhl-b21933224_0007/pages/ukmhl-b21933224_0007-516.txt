CHAPTER LI. TUMOURS OF THE BREAST. Mammary tumours may be either simple or malignant; with the exception of fibro-adenoma the former are rare. Fibromata may occur, but are possibly the result of previous chronic lobular mastitis which leads to the de- struction of the acini and leaves a fibrous mass which goes on increasing in size. FIBRO-ADENOMA OF THE BREAST. This is the most common benign tumour of the breast. Pure adenomata, that is to say tumours composed entirely of acini, are very rare; in the great majority the epithelial tubules are separated by a considerable amount of fibrous tissue, and the epithelial proliferation is probably secondary. In one form of fibro-adenoma the epithelial elements are chiefly arranged as small clusters, of acini^—the so-called "acinous adenoma"; whilst in the other the tubes ramify through the fibrous tissue ; these tubules are dilated and have ramifications—the so-called "tubular or canalicular adenoma." The fibrous tissue forming the bulk of the tumour is embryonic, or at any rate highly cellular, whilst in some cases it presents a myxomatous appear- ance and the tumour receives the name of " myxo-adenoma." Occasionally the acini become dilated and form cysts, from the walls of which masses of young fibrous tissue covered with epithelium project into the cavity forming the so-called " intra-cystic growflis." Tumours possessing intra- cystic growths sometimes grow rapidly and may attain a considerable .size. Sometimes the connective tissue is exceedingly embryonic and the growth of the tumour is very rapid and this variety has been termed " adeno-sarcoma," but it would seem probable that the only true sarcomatous tumour of the breast Is one which contains either no glandular elements whatever or only the mere remains of tubules. The.se tumours are frequently encapsuled. They are generally single but they may be multiple, and they vary in size from a hazel-nut to an

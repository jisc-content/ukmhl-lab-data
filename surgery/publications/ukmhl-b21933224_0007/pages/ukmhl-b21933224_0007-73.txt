Local causes, such as thread-worms, leucorrhoea, piles, etc., should be removed and, where no local cause can be found and the boracic lotion proves inefficient, various ointments, particularly s"/^ oleate of mercury, or 12Â°/^ chloroform ointment, are useful. Other useful applications are unguentum plumbi acetatis, containing ten to fifteen grains of cocaine to the ounce, lead lotion or a strong solution of nitrate of silver (a drachm to a drachm and a half to the ounce) painted over the surface every two or three days. Opium should never be given to control the pain as it causes constipation and increases the irritation. If there be much restlessness, chloral, bromide of ammonium or potassium, sulphonal or trional may be employed. When the skin is hypertrophied the parts may be pencilled with equal parts of carbolic acid and tincture of iodine every other day. If in addition to being hypertrophied the parts are much fissured, the application of the actual cautery may be necessary. This acts by destroying the terminations of the nerves but should only be applied superficially so as not to cause deep ulceration. COCCYDYNIA has already been described (see Part III., p. 107).

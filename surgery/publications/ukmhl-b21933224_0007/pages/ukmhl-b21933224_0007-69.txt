FISTULA IN ANO. 41 this is to dilate or incise the external opening and then to dilate the track right up to the bowel. The sinus is then thoroughly scraped and packed from the bottom and the bowels are so regulated that feces do not accumulate, and it may happen in rare instances that the fistula heals completely. In any case the discharge will diminish and the patient will be much more comfortable, while at the same time he does not run much risk of extensive burrowing of pus. This method however can only be looked upon as a palliative measure to be employed under exceptional circum- stances. When the fistula passes through the levator ani but is not connected with the rectum, the only treatment, as far as the fistulous track itself is concerned, is to lay it freely open, to enlarge the opening through the levator ani, to scrape its walls and to insure proper drainage. If the sinus lead to bare bone in the pelvis, an attempt may be made to treat it appropriately. Should it run to the prostate or to the broad ligament, etc., the primary cause must be dealt with according to circumstances. The patient should in all cases be kept in bed until the deeper part of the wound has healed, and the bowels should be regulated on the lines already laid down for an ordinary fistula in ano.

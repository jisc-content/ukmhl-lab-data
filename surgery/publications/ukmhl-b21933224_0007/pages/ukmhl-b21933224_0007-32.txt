4 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. right-hand wall about 3 to 3^ inches above the anus, whilst the upper one projects from the left-hand wall near the commencement of the rectum, men the bowel is empty these folds stand out about half an mch from the rectal wall and overlap one another, and they thus serve to keep the pressure of the rectal contents off the sphincter; they also act as an obstacle to the passage of a rectal tube. Fig. 3.â€”The Nekve-Supply of the Rf.ctum and Anus. The dissection shows the nerve-supply to the sphincters and hov/ it will be affected by such operations as Kraske's. S.N. Great Sciatic Nerve.

There are also longitudinal folds (the columns of Morgagni), prolonged upwards from the radiating folds about the anus, which are united at their lower ends by small valvular folds of mucous membrane and serve to prevent the escape of the liquid contents of the bowel. It is amongst these folds that a fissure of the anus usually occurs. The arterial supply of the rectum is derived partly from the mesenteric and partly from the internal iliac vessels (see Fig. 2). The entire upper part is supplied by the superior heemorrhoidal branch of the inferior mesenteric artery, the mucous membrane of the middle part is supplied by the same vessel while the rest is supplied by the middle haemorrhoidal

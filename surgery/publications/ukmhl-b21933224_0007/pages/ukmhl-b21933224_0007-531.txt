SECTION II.—AFFECTIONS OF THE THORAX AND ITS CONTENTS. CHAPTER LII. FRACTURES OF THE RIBS, COSTAL CARTILAGES AND STERNUM. FRACTURE OF THE RIBS. These injuries are most common during adult life; when growth is complete the ribs become less • elastic and the cartilages more ossified and brittle, and fracture is therefore more likely to follow comparatively slight violence than in the young in whom the ribs are very elastic and bend without breaking. Fractures of the ribs are more common in men than in women and may be due to either direct or indirect violence. The seat of a fracture from direct violence corresponds to the point of application of the force, and the ends of the bones are driven inwards and the inner surface is more split up than the outer. Unless the violence be very great or the rib be fractured in more than one place, the elasticity of the bone causes it to resume its normal outline almost immediately, but before this occurs the sharp edges may cause laceration of the vessels or puncture of the pleura or the lung as they are driven in. The commonest cause of this fracture however is compression of the chest from before backwards or from side to side. The ribs are then fractured from indirect violence, being bent beyond their limit of elasticity and giving way at their weakest point. In antero-posterior compression, which is the commonest form of injury, the fracture occurs either about the mid-axillary line or at some point between that and the angle of the ribs. The tendency is for the broken ends of the bone to start outwards in this form of fracture, and adjacent structures are rarely injured except when the thorax is subjected to a crushing force. Fracture of the ribs may also occur from muscular action alone, as for example during parturition.

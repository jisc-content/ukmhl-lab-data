CHAPTER XIV. THE INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE GALL-BLADDER AND BILE DUCTS. These may be divided into the inflammatory affections of the gall-bladder— cholecystitis—and those of the bile ducts—cholangitis. The affections are generally acute, and may be simple or suppurative. CHOLECYSTITIS. SUPPURATIVE CHOLECYSTITIS.—This generally takes the form of simple empyema of the gall-bladder and is usually associated with the presence of stones in the gall-bladder. There may be however a gan- grenous inflammation or a perforation of the organ; the gangrenous form, which is very rare, not infrequently accompanies typhoid fever, dysentery, or appendicitis. Empyema of the gall-bladder is generally associated with a stone lodged in the neck of the organ or the cystic duct, the gall-bladder dilating behind it. There need be little or no constitutional disturbance, unless ulceration of the mucous membrane be present, and the patient merely > suffers from anorexia and malaise, with a little pain referred to the right hepatic region, and some tenderness on palpation over it. When there is a distended gall-bladder, this can be felt as a rounded swelling just outside the ninth right costal cartilage. When however there is no distension, the true state of matters is often not found out until the abdomen has been opened. When the suppurative inflammation has lasted for some time, firm adhesions occur around the gall-bladder which may become fixed to the abdominal wall, while at the same time there is an increase in the general symptoms, with marked pyrexia and great tenderness on pressure, immobility of that part of the abdomen and, in fact, symptoms of localised peritonitis. When the pus finds its way out from the gall-bladder it generally does so

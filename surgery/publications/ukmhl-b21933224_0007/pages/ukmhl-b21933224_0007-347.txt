SECTION III.—AFFECTIONS OF THE PROSTATE AND URETHRA. CHAPTER XXXIII. TRAUMATIC AND INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE PROSTATE. INJURIES OF THE PROSTATE. Injuries from external violence are very rare and are either punctured wounds caused by falls upon pointed instruments or contusions in the perineum ; injuries from within may result from the passage of instruments. The importance of these injuries is the danger of extravasation of urine and septic infection, the latter being particularly prone to occur in the large venous prostatic plexus. Treatment.—The main points are to avoid extravasation of urine and septic infection ; free drainage must therefore be provided, and should be combined with measures for securing asepsis of the urine. When the injury takes the form of a severe perineal contusion, there may be so much inflammatory swelling as to render drainage of the bladder by a catheter difficult, and it will then be best to perform median perineal section (see p. 309) at once and drain the bladder by a perineal tube (see p. 310). This may be left out in ten days or a fortnight, and a catheter tied into the bladder through the urethra^ and the perineal wound allowed to heal. Should the prostate be very severely damaged, it may be difficult to pass a catheter or even to find the way into the bladder after a perineal section, and the best plan will then be to open the bladder above the pubes, when the vesical orifice of the urethra can be identified and a catheter passed from the .supra-pubic opening down through the urethra where it may be tied in. In addition to this, urinary antiseptics (see p. 274) should be given, the bowels should be kept freely open, while morphine and belladonna sup- positories may be required for the reHef of pain. ' For fletails as to tying in a catheter, see p. 345.

THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SCROTUM. Treatment.â€”Early and free excision must be practised here as for malignant disease elsewhere, and any suspicious warty surface on the scrotum should be removed freely even though there may be no history of rapid growth. The incision should be elliptical and go at least an inch wide of the base of the tumour in all directions; the whole thickness of the skin and dartos should be taken away. Castration will be called for should there be any sign of adhesion of the scrotum to the testis, but in ordinary cases this is unnecessary. The inguinal glands, at any rate those on the same side as the tumour, should be carefully examined and, if there be any suspicion of enlargement, the entire glandular area must be extirpated. There is really nothing special in the treatment of this affection except to remember that the case should be treated very early and that the apparently benign character of the growth in the early stages should not be allowed to mis- lead the surgeon as to its true nature.

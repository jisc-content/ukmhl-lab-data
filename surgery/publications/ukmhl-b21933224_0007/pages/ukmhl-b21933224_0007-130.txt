I02 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE PANCREAS. NEW GROWTHS OF THE PANCREAS. Tumours of the pancreas are not uncommon, the great majority belong- ing to the class of carcinomata. Other tumours, such as adenofnata, or, very rarely, sarcomata may also be found. The surgical treatment of these tumours is practically nil. The most frequent seat of carcinoma of the pancreas is the head of the gland, and it may then compress the bile duct and lead to jaundice. Should this be the case, cholecystenterostomy —connecting the gall-bladder with the duodenum—may give relief (see p. 151). When the tumour is large and compresses the pylorus, gastro- enterostomy may be called for; but these growths generally extend rapidly and are accompanied by great pain, and it is questionable whether it is worth while interfering. Attempts have been made to remove the tumour and, when this is in the tail of the pancreas and is movable, it may be possible to do so. Tumours in the head of the pancreas practically involve total extirpation of the gland, and this is well-nigh impossible. Encapsuled tumours have been removed by tearing through the gastro- colic omentum, opening up the peritoneum over the gland and shelling out the growth. Note.—For further information upon the interesting subject of affections of the pancreas, the reader may refer to the excellent work upon The Diseases of the Pancreas, by Robson and Moynihan (London, Saunders & Co.), published since the above was in print.

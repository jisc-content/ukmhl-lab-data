So THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. will require to be removed the surgeon has next to make up his mind as to what shall be done with the divided end of the bowel after the growth has been cut away. There are four possible ways of dealing with the divided end of the boivel after excision ofca?icer of the rectum. The ideal method is to join the divided ends together and thus to restore the continuity of the bowel. A second plan is to bring the lower end of the rectum down to the anal margin and suture it there and thus to form a fresh anus in its normal position. A third plan is to bring out the lower end of the rectum and suture it to the skin margin Fig. 20.â€”The Anatomy of the Parts concerned in Kraske's Operation BEFORE REMOVAL OF THE CoCCYX IN THE MaLE.

Sacro-sciatic ligament (in dotted outline). {Hariiiiatm and Qiihiii.) immediately beneath the divided end of the sacrum, while the fourth plan, formerly adopted by some, is to leave the divided end of the rectum open at the bottom of the wound and pack the gap in the soft parts below it so as to form a cicatricial track from that point to the skin. Although we mention this last procedure we do not recommend it; it is only to be done in extreme emergencies because it results in an extensive and intractable stricture and causes great difificulty subsequently. We even doubt whether it should ever be done as, if so much rectum has to be taken away that it is impossible to bring the ends down to the skin anywhere, it will be better to invaginate the lower end of the rectum and suture it completely and then to perform an inguinal colotomy.

Ill 54 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. that it is desired to clamp. The identification and fixation of the piles to be removed should be done before the clamp is applied to the first one, as otherwise the manipulations necessary to secure the piles in the forceps sub- sequently may tear asunder the eschars already made by the cautery and so provoke bleeding. In the female the identification of the piles can be greatly facilitated by introducing a finger into the vagina and pressing the anterior wall of the rectum forcibly backwards. c Fit;. 14.â€”Instruments for the Ci.a.mi' and Cautery Operation for Pii.es. A, ring forceps ; B, Smith's clamp; C, c.iutery, with air-jacket round handle to prevent over-heating. The clamp is now applied to the first pile to be removed in such a manner that its long axis is parallel to that of the bowel, a most important point, the neglect of which may lead to serious contraction subsequently. The clamp employed (see Fig. 14. B) should have a powerful screw, and care must be taken in applying it to see that the entire pile is within the grasp of the blades, as, if carelessly applied, a portion of the haemorrhoid may project beyond the end of the instrument and this is a proHfic source of troublesome bleeding. The clamp is now screwed up tight and the cautery is applied.

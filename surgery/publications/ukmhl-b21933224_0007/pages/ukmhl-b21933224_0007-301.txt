As soon as the clots and extravasated urine have been removed, and it is seen that the rent runs into the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal reflection above the bladder should be opened by a median vertical incision, and the steps detailed below for an intra-peritoneal rupture should be adopted. It must never be forgotten that an operation upon Fig. 61.â€”Kxposuke ok a Rui'Tuhe ok thi-; Bi.auuer kxiknding thkoluh the Peritoneai. Coat. The peritoneal reflection is incised in the middle line and the intestines are packed ofT. This gives easy access to the intra-peritoneal rent which is closed first by Lembert's sutures. When this has been done, the peritoneal reflection is also sutured completely and the rest of the operation is done as shown in the preceding figure. a case of laceration of the bladder associated with a fracture of the pelvis converts the fracture into a compound one, and that the c[uestion of sepsis is of the highest importance. Should the rupture be purely intra-peritoneal, the tissues in front of the bladder are normal and the incision in the abdominal wall should then be extended upwards so as to open the peritoneum above the bladder ; the posterior surface of the organ can then be inspected. The patient should lie flat upon the operating table until the abdomen has been opened, llie PT. VI. 2 s

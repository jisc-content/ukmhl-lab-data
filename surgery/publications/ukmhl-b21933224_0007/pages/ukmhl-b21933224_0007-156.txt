128 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE BILE PASSAGES. The inflammation varies much in intensity and may be suppurative, phlegmonous or gangrenous and may be followed by most serious com- plications, such as • septicsemia or pyaemia. The symptoms are similar to those of the simple suppurative form, but rigors are generally present, the liver is markedly enlarged, and the patient rapidly falls into the typhoid state. Treatment.—The treatment of this affection should be mainly directed to the cause and will consist in removing any gall-stones that have given rise to the affection and securing efificient drainage of the bile passages (see Chap. XV.). Any abscess in the liver should also be opened and drained as early as possible (see p. 115). Should no gall-stones be found either in the gall-bladder or in the common duct, the case is presumably one in which the inflammation has spread from the gall-bladder, and a cholecystostomy with drainage for a few weeks should be employed. In all cases the common duct should be incised if possible and efficient drainage provided. These operations are dealt with elsewhere (see pp. 140, 145).

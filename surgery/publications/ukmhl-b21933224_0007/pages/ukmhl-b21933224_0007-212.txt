184 '^^^ SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEY. be practised, as well as massage and Faradism, in order to strengthen the abdominal muscles, and the bowels must be carefully regulated. The abdominal belt should be worn for at least six months; if the patient finds it comfortable it may be worn for a long period. In the course of three or four months gentle exercise may be allowed. Six months however should be allowed to elapse before the patient is allowed to consider herself perfectly well and able to do things like other people. It is exceptional for the kidney to become unduly movable after this operation ; should it do so, it is doubtful whether a second operation will succeed any better, although it has done so in some cases. Nephrectomy.â€”Should the kidney again become mobile and give rise to severe symptoms, the question of nephrectomy will arise. This is very seldom justifiable for simple movable kidney, as, if nephropexy fails, nephrectomy is very apt to prove futile also unless the real source of the trouble be due to some disease in the kidney or to intermittent hydronephrosis. It may however be indicated when the pain is intense and almost exclusively renal in character, as indicated by colic, haematuria, or enlargement, of the organ. If the mobile kidney be diseased, the affected organ must be treated on the lines laid down for the particular condition, and, if this do not involve removal of the organ, the kidney must also be fixed in position afterwards (vide supra). The condition of intermittent hydronephrosis is dealt with separately (see Chap. XXIII.).

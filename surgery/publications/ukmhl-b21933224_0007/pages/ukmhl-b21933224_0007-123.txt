DIVISION 11. THE SURGICAL AFFFXTIONS OF THE PANCREAS, LIVER. AND SPLEEN. CHAPTER XI. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE PANCREAS. INJURIES OF THE PANCREAS. These are comparatively rare and of no great surgical importance because they are practically never the sole lesion. The position of the pancreas is such that injury to it must almost certainly be accompanied by others such as rupture of the stomach, liver or spleen, whether the pancreas be contused by a direct blow or a run-over injury or penetrated by a sharp instrument or a bullet. The injury to the organ is generally only recognised in the course of operative interference for a severe abdominal injury, although, in the case of penetrating or bullet wounds, it may be suspected from the direction of the wound. Hence the importance of the cases lies chiefly in the fact that the surgeon should bear the possibility of their occurrence in mind when he has to deal with a general abdominal injury; he should more especially remember the likelihood of bleeding coming from the large vessels about the pancreas when the abdomen has been opened for haemorrhage. The pancreas may be bruised, ruptured or so damaged that gangrene may follow, or its vessels may be torn and there may be bleeding into its substance, beneath its capsule or, still worse, into the general abdominal cavity. Acute pancreatitis may follow an injury and may end in suppuration and general pyaemia, or the more chronic form may ensue. Blood-cysts may also form, and contusion is one of the common causes of a pancreatic cyst (see p. 98). TREATMENT.â€”There is little to say concerning the treatment of injuries of the pancreas per se. Should the abdomen be opened for severe

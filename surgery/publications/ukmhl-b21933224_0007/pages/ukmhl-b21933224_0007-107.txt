The parts having been shaved and disinfected, a median incision is made from just behind the anus to the lower border of the sacrum. If it be necessary to extend the skin incision it should be diverted slightly to the left side. The soft parts are raised down to the coccyx off which the periosteum is peeled and the structures attached to it are then divided close to the bone and the tissues separated from its anterior surface with a raspatory; the bone is then easily disarticulated and removed. This is often followed by smart bleeding from the middle sacral artery which, however, is easily picked up and twisted. The fat and fascia covering the levator ani are then exposed and are divided in the middle line through- KiG. ig.â€”Bardenheuer's Line of Division of the Sacrum t\ Exxision op the Rectum. This is the line of bone section recommended in the text. The coccyx is also removed. out the whole length of the wound which is deepened between the levatores ani until the cellular tissue immediately outside the rectum is reached. With a very little manipulation the tumour in the rectum can now be felt and its limits ascertained and it will then be evident whether more bone must be taken away. If necessary, the posterior surface of the sacrum is cleared up to the third sacral foramen, the muscles and ligaments separated on either side and the periosteum cleared from the front of the bone. With a chisel or powerful punch forceps as much of the bone as is necessary may be removed as far up as a line drawn transversely just below the third sacral foramina. After the bone has been removed, all bleeding points are secured and the median incision in the deeper parts is extended upwards as far as possible; this exposes the rectum with the peri-rectal tissues and glands and the levator ani below. When it is evident how much of the rectum

ANATOMY OF THE KIDNEY. Fig. 34.—The .Suijface-Mauki.ng of the Kiunev FROM THE FRONT. {Mo>-ris.) (2) A line from the top of this first line outwards at right angles to it for 2| inches. (3) A line from the lower end of the first transversely outwards for 2f inches. (4) A line parallel to the first and connecting the outer extremities of the (2) and (3) lines first described (see Fig. 35)-" The upper two-thirds of the normal kidney are under cover of the ribs, but the lower third descends below them.^ The upper end of the kidney is about a centimetre nearer the spinal column than the lower end. The outer border at its upper part is three and a quarter inches from the middle line, at the lower part three and three-quarter inches. The hilum of the left kidney is two inches from the aorta, and the hilum of the right kidney about one / \ ; ,'■ \ and three-quarter inches from / i \ the vena cava. These measure- ments however may be greatly altered by disease, especially inflammatory affections, owing to the condensation and shrinking of the tissues in the hilum, so that, on the right side especially, the vena cava may be brought quite close to the inner border of the kidney. The right kidney is lower than the left by some- thing like half an inch, but this is not absolutely constant. In the hilum of the kidney lie the renal artery, the renal vein, and the ureter, along with lymphatics, which run to the median lumbar glands, and nerves which are derived from the renal plexus and the lesser splanchnic nerve. In the pelvis of the kidney the relation of these structures is, ' The usual anatomical leachint; is that Iwo-thircls of the kichicy lie lielow the rihs.

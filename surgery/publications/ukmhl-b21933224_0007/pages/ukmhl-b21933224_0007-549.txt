I CHAPTER LIV. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE THORAX AND ITS CONTENTS. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE RIBS AND STERNUM. SEPTIC OSTEO MYELITIS OF THE THORACIC WALL — Acute infective osteo-myelitis in its typical severe form seldom affects either the ribs or sternum, but a less severe or sub-acute form is not uncommon and occurs most frequently as a sequela of typhoid fever; it may also occur in children in connection vfith acute osteo-myelitis affecting other bones. Symptoms.—These are similar to those of the disease elsewhere (see Part III., p. 173) but are comparatively sub-acute in character and result in necrosis of the portions of the ribs or sternum affected. The temperature is generally high and there may be rigors and septicsemic symptoms accom- panied by the formation of a tender swelling over the affected area, the skin over which becomes oedematous and boggy and soon shows fluctuation, The sequestrum usually becomes loose in about six weeks and only involves a portion of the bone. Treatment.—This is the same as for septic osteo-myelitis in general (see Part III., p. 175). The parts should be thoroughly exposed at the earliest opportunity, the pus evacuated and the wound left open. It is best not to remove any portion of the rib in the first instance, but to wait for the separation of the sequestrum, which is removed in the usual manner (see Part III., p. 187). In cases following typhoid fever however, the typhoid bacillus is very apt to remain in the medulla of the bone for a long period and, even if the sequestrum be removed and the inflammatory material apparently taken away, healing may not occur and fresh inflammation may be set up, and hence in these particular cases we are inclined to depart from the general rule and remove entirely the portion of the rib which is the seat of inflammation so as to make sure of removing the whole focus of disease.

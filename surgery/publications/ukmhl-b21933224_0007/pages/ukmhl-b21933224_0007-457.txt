429 PARAPHIMOSIS. When the swelling is very marked, and especially when ulceration has occurred, this plan will not succeed and the constricting band must be divided under an anaesthetic. The preputial ring is exposed by flexing the glans downwards (see Fig. 100), a sharp-pointed curved bistoury is introduced beneath it on either side of the middle line and the constriction is freely nicked. The incision should go through the skin and subcutaneous tissues and the prepuce can then be drawn forward easily with a little manipulation. The reason for making the incision on either side of the middle line is to avoid the dorsal vein of the penis. After reduction the question of circumcision will arise, as the condition is very apt to recur, especially in children, and when the constriction has been so tight that there is ulceration, circumcision is certainly called for, as otherwise contraction will follow healing of the ulceration and the preputial ring will be tighter than before. At the same time it is not always advisable to perform circumcision immediately after the reduction of a paraphimosis. In adults the accident frequently happens as a result of withdrawing the prepuce in a case of balanitis in order to cleanse the glans and, if circumcision were done here before the balanitis is cured, serious septic mischief might result. In these cases therefore it will be best to wait for a few days until the balanitis has disappeared and then to perform circumcision.

292 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER. then taken out and a fresh one introduced, and changed daily to prevent the deposit of salts upon it.^ The tube draining the pre-vesical space may be left out in three days if no suppuration occurs. The bladder should be washed out twice daily with boracic lotion through the supra-pubic tube^ and a drachm of iodoform and glycerine emulsion (io%) afterwards introduced into the bladder. The drainage should be kept up until the pus- has disappeared and there are no other signs of inflammation; this will take at least six weeks. The greatest care must be observed in the aseptic management of the case, and gauze should be carefully packed around the tube, and the skin thoroughly cleansed at each change of dressing. The pubes. should be shaved from time to time and carefully disinfected, and the tube should be boiled each time before it is introduced into the bladder. This plan of draining the bladder continuously after the local treatment of the ulcers answers fairly well and is a great improvement upon the method of suturing the organ completely after the ulcers have been treated. General medical measures must also be adopted (see p. 288). The treatment of secondary bladder tuberculosis.—The surgeon will probably be wise to delay operative interference here as long as possible. If the patient suffers severely however, the only method likely to give relief is supra-pubic drainage; this obviously cannot be curative and probably will have to be permanent. ■ There will be fairly free leakage of urine from the abdominal wound, at any rale for the first few days, and large pads of sterilised compressed moss or other suitable material should be placed in each groin in order to soak it up. The dressings will need changing several times a day for the first few days.

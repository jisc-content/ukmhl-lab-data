SECTION II.â€”AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER. CHAPTER XXV. GENERAL METHODS OF DIAGNOSIS. When examining a case of suspected disease of the bladder the first point is to itiake sure that the disease affects that organ, as diseases occurring else- where in the urinary tract may give rise to symptoms that on superficial examination may be mistaken for those of an affection of the bladder; the second point is to ascertain the nature of the disease. The diagnosis of vesical affections is arrived at by a consideration of the symptoms present, by examination of the urine, and finally by various methods of vesical examination. The symptoms will be dealt with more fully in connection with the individual diseases ; here we shall merely indicate their general significance. The most important are alterations in the act of micturition. Frequency of micturition is common to most bladder affections, but it also occurs when the bladder is healthy ; for example, it is a common symptom of renal stone, especially when the latter is trying to pass down the ureter. It is a characteristic symptom of certain diseases of the prostate; it is met with in dyspeptics who pass large quantities of oxalates or in gouty persons who pass abnormal quantities of uric acidj and it also occurs in the subjects of hpemorrhoids, hypochondriasis, hysteria, diabetes, and some diseases of the spinal cord, etc. Hence this symptom alone does not imply a morbid condition of the bladder. In estimating the value of this symptom it is important to ascertain under what circumstances it is most marked; for instance, if it occurs during the night, it is strong presumptive evidence in favour of enlargement of the prostate, whereas, if the contrary be the case, it points to the presence of a calculus in the bladder or to some nervous affection. When it is increased by exertion it points to a renal or a vesical calculus, and this view will be con- firmed if rest in the dorsal position causes diminution in it, as rest has no

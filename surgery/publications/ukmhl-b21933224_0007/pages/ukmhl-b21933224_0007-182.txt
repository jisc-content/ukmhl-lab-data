CHAPTER XVI. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN. TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN. Injuries of this organ are rare, exxept in connection with severe abdominal crushes. They may be divided into penetrating wounds and contusions or ruptures. Fenetratmg wounds are comparatively seldom met with, owing to the sheltered position of the organ beneath the ribs, and are generally caused by firearms. Coniusmts and ruptures of the spleen are more common, and are caused either by severe blows—such as a kick from a horse or a run-over accident—or from a comparatively slight injury to a previously enlarged spleen. Except in the last variety, rupture is usually accompanied by other lesions, and the outlook is very grave. When the injury is comparatively slight there may be merely extravasation of blood within the capsule of the organ, but in more severe cases the spleen is partially or entirely ruptured, or even in bad cases completely pulped up; these cases are followed by almost immediate death from hasmorrhage. Indeed, when the serous envelope of the spleen is torn, death from haemorrhage is liable to follow, if not immediately, at any rate in a com- paratively short time. SYMPTOMS.—The symptoms of rupture of the spleen are profound shock and signs of intra-abdominal hsemorrhage. The diagnosis as to the exact organ injured will depend partly on the severity of the haemorrhage, because bleeding from the spleen is always more severe than from any other organ, and partly on the fact that there has been an injury in the splenic region ; if the patient be known to suffer from an enlarged spleen the probability of that being the organ injured is much increased. There is often tenderness and an increase of dulness in the splenic area. TREATMENT.—AVhen the patient survives long enough, the abdomen must be opened and the injured organ dealt with. In a good many cases the abdomen is opened without exact knowledge of the injury, and

CHAPTER XXXVIL TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA. Damage done to the urethra by the passage of instruments is not included here; it will be more appropriately described with stricture of the urethra (see Chap. XL.). From its protected position the urethra is but little exposed to injury by penetrating wounds. The common injuries take the form of kicks or falls astride and give rise to contusions or rupture of the urethra. PUNCTURED AND INCISED WOUNDS. Punctured wounds rarely call for surgical interference. HeaHng is rapid and satisfactory, and the cicatrix is small and does not give rise to trouble from subsequent contraction. Incised wounds are rare and, if the incision be parallel to the long axis of the urethra, the treatment is simple, as the wound does not gape; it is merely necessary to see that the skin wound is sufficiently free for drainage. If the incision be clean, one or two catgut stitches should be put in the urethra to keep the edges together but should not penetrate the mucous membrane. Healing is rapid, and there is little tendency to subsequent stricture, as the cicatrix is in the long axis of the canal. The patient is allowed to micturate naturally. If however the wound cross the long axis of the urethra trans- versely, or even obliquely, a stricture will inevitably result if cicatrisation be allowed to occur without perfect coaptation of the cut edges, and the treatment must be directed to securing this. A full-sized gum-elastic catheter should be first passed into the bladder, after which the urethra is well exposed by a free longitudinal incision through the soft parts so as to lay bare the whole extent of the urethral injury. The cut edges of the urethra are then accurately united with fine catgut, the ends of the urethra being freed a little if necessary to allow the edges to come together without tension. The sutures should be passed in

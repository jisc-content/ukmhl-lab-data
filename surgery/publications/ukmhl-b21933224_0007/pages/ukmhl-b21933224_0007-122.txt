THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. 94 not only by considerable haemorrhage but by excessive shock and even by a risk of sepsis. A most interesting fact is seen in Quenu's figures, namely, that nine women were operated on with eight successes and one death, while all the seven cases in which the operation was performed on men terminated fatally. We cannot help thinking that this somewhat heroic operation will not find general favour. Cases calling for entire extirpation of the rectum with removal of enlarged glands in the hollow of the sacrum are probably cases which are better not submitted to excision, while those that are really suited for excision are to our minds equally well off if the operation practised by Kraske or some modification of it, followed if necessary at a subsequent period by the establishment of an inguinal colotomy, be performed.

IMPERFORATE ANUS AND RECTUM. 13 into the vagina is best left until the patient has grown up; by that time the fistula may have closed so completely that nothing further is necessary; should it persist it may be closed in the usual manner by dissecting out the fistulous track and suturing the mucous membrane of the vagina and the rectum separately. When (lie fistula communicates with the bladder or the urethra, the treat- ment is extremely difficult. In the former case the risks of suppurative nephritis are very great, and the child usually dies. It may be possible to open the rectum from the perineum when the communication is with the urethra, and the bowels should then be regulated so that the fseces are kept solid and therefore less likely to find their way into the urethra. This may be successful, and the child may escape suppurative nephritis. When, however, the opening is into the bladder the gut generally terminates high up in the pelvis, and cannot be reached from the perineum. Here an inguinal colotomy is the only alternative, and the bowel should then be completely divided across,^ the upper end being fixed into the wound, after a Paul's tube has been tied in (see Part VI., Sec. I., p. 325), whilst the lower end is invaginated and sutured so as to prevent any possibility of meconium finding its way into the bladder. This is of course an operation of the greatest severity in a child of this age, and few will survive it; even should the child live, it will grow up with a permanent artificial anus which can never be remedied. In face of such a lamentable prospect as this the parents will probably refuse to allow the operation. ' This should be done as near to the bladder as is consistent with proper invagination of the lower end, in order to leave as little as possible of the bowel communicating with the bladder.

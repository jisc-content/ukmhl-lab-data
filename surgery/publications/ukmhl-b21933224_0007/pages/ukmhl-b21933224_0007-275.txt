When there is a valvular obstruction at the junction of the ureter with the pelvis, a very useful method is to open the pelvis of the kidney and, after introducing a probe through the ureteral orifice, to divide the adjacent ureteral and pelvic wall in front of it for nearly an inch, taking care however not to go too low down, as otherwise the cellular tissue around the organ will Fig. 52.—Method of treating a Valvular connection dktween the Ureter •\ND THE Renal Pelvls. This is the operation described in the text and is done through a separate incision in the renal pelvis which is afterwards closed by suture. By its means a valvular opening is converted into an efficient one situated at a lower level on the wall of the renal pelvis, and the valve-action is done away with. be opened up and there may be leakage (see Fig. 52). When the valve has been divided in this way, the mucous membrane of the pelvis and the ureter are closely united by interrupted catgut sutures, and it is well to put one or two Lembert sutures outside at the lower angle of the incision so as to make quite sure that no leakage occurs. The opening in the pelvis of the kidney is closed by Lembert's sutures, and it is always well to fix the kidney to the loin in the usual manner (see p. 177) so as to prevent kinking. If these methods fail and the attacks of hydronephrosis persist in spite of them, nephrectomy will have to be considered. As a rule the condition is unilateral and if so, and if the patient insist on it, there is no objection to nephrectomy. The only alternatives are either to drain the hydronephrosis through the loin or to attempt to dilate the ureter with bougies; the latter method is very difficult and uncertain.

CHAPTER XLIX. HYDROCELE: HEMATOCELE: VARICOCELE. HYDROCELE. ACUTE HYDROCELE.—This is rare compared with the chronic form, and it generally follows injury or is secondary to acute epididymitis or orchitis ; sometimes it is secondary to an inflammatory condition of the scrotum or cord and it may accompany thrombosis of a varicocele or occur in specific fevers. The surface of the tunica vaginalis becomes coated with lymph, and some obliteration of the vaginal sac may result from adhesion of the opposed surfaces. The effused fluid coagulates readily and as a rule is absorbed quickly when the affection to which it is secondary ceases ; the fluid however may occasionally remain as a chronic hydrocele. Symptoms.—In acute nonsuppurative hydrocele the outlines of the testicle and epididymis are lost and there is a smooth, fluctuating, translucent swelling which is very tender, the skin over it being red and cedematous; there is no pyrexia. Treatment.—As this condition is a secondary one, the treatment of the hydrocele itself is not of much importance. Operative interference is very seldom required, but, if the pain be great and the swelling does not soon subside, it is permissible to puncture the sac and draw off" some of the fluid. There is however danger of introducing septic material, and moreover coagulation occurs if blood corpuscles get into the fluid, and the sac may become filled with clot which will not only delay recovery but will give rise to partial or entire obliteration of the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. If therefore puncture be employed for the relief of pain, a small exploring needle should be employed and any visible vessels should be avoided. The patient should not be allowed to walk about until the fluid has been completely absorbed, lest a chronic hydrocele result. Suppuration may sometimes occur in acute hydrocele and is recognised by an increase in the pain and the local symptoms accompanied by pyrexia.

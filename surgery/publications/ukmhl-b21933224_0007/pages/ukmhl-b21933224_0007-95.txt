67 PROLAPSE. bowel to the periosteum below the sacrum. The perineal wound is brought together with a few silkworm-gut stitches and a small antiseptic dressing is fastened on with collodion; the bowels are kept confined for a few days and primary union generally results. While the immediate results in this operation are usually very satisfactory, they do not last very long and the prolapse generally recurs in a few months. It may be advantageously combined with a linear cauterisation after the perineal wound has healed, or any prolapsed mucous membrane remaining may be removed, as in Whitehead's operation (see p. 51). Neither of these procedures, however, compares either in accuracy or in its results with complete excision of the prolapse, which is the method of choice where the milder measures such as cauterisation fail.

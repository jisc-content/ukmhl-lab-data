THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST. DUCT PAPILLOMA AND DUCT CARCINOMA. Papillomata may form small tumours projecting into the galactophorous ducts by a narrow pedicle and blocking them so as to give rise to a dilatation behind. They bleed readily and one of their symptoms is the escape of a bloody discharge from the nipple. On examining the breast in the early stages nothing may be discovered, but a small tumour can generally be felt later on beneath the nipple or areola. It is quite impossible to diagnose a duct papilloma from a duct carcinoma in the early stages; later on the carcinoma forms a larger tumour and follows a course similar to that of the ordinary form of cancer, though it is apparently less malignant. Treatment. â€” In all cases the part of the duct involved should be excised if it can be locaHsed, and if examination of the specimen removed shows it to be simply a pedunculated papilloma projecting into the duct, the surgeon may be content with the local removal; should there be any evidence that the epithelial elements are infiltrating the tissues around, however, the case will be one of duct carcinoma and the surgeon should at once proceed to remove the breast completely. If the case be seen at an early stage an exception may possibly be made to the ordinary rule of removing the axillary glands at the same time, but should the disease have extended beyond the wall of the duct or should there be any sign of enlargement of the glands in the axilla, the complete operation for cancer of the breast should be undertaken (see p. 493).

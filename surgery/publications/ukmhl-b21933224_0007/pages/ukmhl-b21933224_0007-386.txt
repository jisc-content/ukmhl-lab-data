358 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA. the first five or six days. The tube is left out when union of the flaps is complete and the perineal opening is allowed to close. The chief objection to this part of Thiersch's operation is that the reflected flap carries with it hairs which grow down into the urethra and may cause trouble from the deposition of phosphatic concretions upon them. Fig. 75.â€”Thiersch's Operation for Epispadias. This shows the final stage, in which the new urethra is connected with the orifice at the neck of the bladder. I. Shows the two flaps a and b marked out. In II. the flap a is reflected and sutured to the pared edge of the new urethra, so that its raw surface is outside. In III. this is covered in by the flap b which has its cutaneous surface outside. The method may be advantageously modified by sliding a flap in from one side with its raw surface looking downwards instead of using the super- imposed flaps mentioned above. The deeper surface of this flap, which should be of large size, naturally granulates and contracts, but if it be made large enough in the first instance, no constriction of any consequence is produced and indeed any slight narrowing that may occur is probably beneficial to the patient in allowing him to obtain some sort of control over the urine in the bladder and in preventing the constant dribbling which is such a distressing feature of ectopia vesicae.

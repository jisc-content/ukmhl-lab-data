CHAPTER XL. STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. Under this term are included all obstructions to micturition due to alterations in the wall of the urethra. Three forms may be distinguished, namely: I. Spasmodic strictiire in which the obstruction is due to spasm of the muscles surrounding the membranous urethra. 2. Congestive strictiire, in which the difficulty is due to inflammatory swelling of the mucous membrane, generally gonorrhoeal; when this condition causes complete retention it is associated with spasm of the membranous urethra. 3. Organic stricture; this is the most important form and will be described first. ORGANIC STRICTURE. In this condition there is an actual organic change in the urethral wall which leads to narrowing or rigidity of the canal. CAUSES.—Organic stricture may be of two varieties: i. It may be traumatic following rupture of the urethra; here the stricture is due to the contraction of the cicatrix formed during repair of the injury. When the urethra is completely divided an annular stricture forms, most commonly in the membranous urethra (see Chap. XXXVII.). 2. The great majority of cases of organic stricture are inflammatory in origin and are due either to repeated attacks of gonorrhoea or to long- continued gleet, in which the inflammation does not remain limited to the surface of the mucous membrane but involves the submucous coat and even the vascular tissue. This form of stricture occurs chiefly in the spongy urethra, most commonly at the bulb itself, and it may spread thence and involve the commencement of the membranous portion, although this is comparatively rare. Another common site of organic stricture is near the urethral orifice, while a third one is just in front of the scrotum at the point of flexure of the penis ; stricture may occur however at any part of the spongy urethra. The stricture may be single or multiple. In very bad cases a considerable length of the urethra may be affected, the tightness •

CHAPTER XXXIX. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA. Inflammations of the urethra may be divided into two great groups, namely, venereal and non-venereal urethritis, the former being far the commoner form. GONORRHCEA. This is the name given to venereal or specific urethritis which is due to a specific organism, the gonococcus of Neisser. This is a small coccus occurring in pairs or groups, the opposed surfaces of the cocci being some- what flattened. In the urethra the gonococci are found essentially in the epithelial cells. They may also be present in the pus cells but they are not found free in the gonorrhoeal pus. They stain readily with aniline dyes but are decolourised by Gram's method and they may be cultivated outside the body, the best medium being serum ; they require a temperature of from 25°-37° C. for their growth. Other organisms are often found in the gonorrhoeal pus but the gonococcus has been clearly shown to be the specific cause of the disease, the others being of secondary importance, although they may help to keep up the inflammatory condition. Among these other organisms are the ordinary pyogenic cocci, and it is probably to them rather than to the gonococcus that suppurative complications, such as bubo, are due. The gonococcus especially attacks the urethral mucous membrane, but it may grow in the rectal or buccal mucous membrane to a slight extent; it flourishes well on the conjunctiva. It may be carried to other structures such as the various synovial or serous membranes in which it sets up inflammation. It is very difficult to extirpate from the male urethra, and in women it may remain for a long time apparently dormant in the folds of the vaginal mucous membrane, lighting up into its pristine activity under certain circumstances. Great care is necessary in diagnosing a case of urethritis as gonorrhoeal because there are various other causes of purulent urethritis; before any

153 BILIARY FISTULA. 6. When the fistula is due to the occlusion of the common duct by a new growth, the tumour will be of a malignant nature and hence the advantage to be gained from operative interference for the cure of the fistula, which could only take the form of cholecystenterostomy, does not counterbalance the risks. A biliary fistula due to this cause should rarely be met with as, when the abdomen has been opened and a malignant growth occluding the common duct has been found, it will be better either to leave the case alone or to do a cholecystenterostomy in preference to a cholecystostomy. When the fistula follows stenosis of the duct due to rupture from injury and subsequent cicatricial contraction the outlook is better, as, although it may be impossible to render the duct patent again, the flow of bile may be diverted from the fistula into the intestine by doing a cholecystenterostomy. The fistula should then close, and the patient will be reheved of his trouble.

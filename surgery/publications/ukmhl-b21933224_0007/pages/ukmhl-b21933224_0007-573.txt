THE TREATMENT OF PULMONARY CAVITIES. PT. VI. 2 2 M with forceps either through the wound in the lung or through a tracheotomy wound. 4. Single bronchiectatic cavities may be cured by operation. In multiple ones however, which is the common condition, the prognosis is not good and the case should only be treated by drainage if the lung be adherent to the chest wall. 5. Basic tuberculous cavities may be similarly treated, but apical ones should never be opened except for harassing cough. The operation here is not curative and the cavity will require treatment afterwards by injections either through the larynx or through the chest wall.

EPITHELIOMA. 435 the former is divided about half an inch below the base of the flap, cutting cleanly down on to the instrument in the urethra, which is then removed. A pair of catch forceps is applied to the cut end of the urethra, the tourniquet is removed and all bleeding is arrested. Bleeding vessels are generally found in the centre of each corpus cavernosum while the dorsal artery of the penis will require ligature on each side, as will also those in the septum between the corpora cavernosa; these may be difificult to seize and may require fenestrated artery forceps. FiG._ loi.â€”Amputatiom of the Penis. I. shows the tourniquet applied, the catheter in position, and the flap marked out,; this flap is reflected in II. In III. the dorsal incision has been made and the knife is transfixing the organ between the corpus spongiosum and the corpora cavernosa preparatory to dividing the latter. This has been done in _IV. where a hole has been made in the flap for the urethra which is in the act of being divided. V. shows the stump sutured. When the bleeding has been arrested, a small vertical slit is made in the centre of the flap and through this the end of the urethra is drawn. The flap is now stitched to the skin on the dorsum, and the orifice of the urethra is then secured to the aperture in the flap. It is necessary to see that this is larger than the normal calibre of the urethra, so as to allow for contraction during healing, and this is best done by slitting up the urethra for a short distance upon its upper and lower surfaces and carefully stitching the edges to the opening in the flap. If there be any oozing from the cut surfaces of the corpora cavernosa a fine catgut drain may be inserted beneath the flap for a day or two. The best dressing is a large boracic fomentation as for circumcision (see p. 425); the patient is allowed to micturate spontaneously.

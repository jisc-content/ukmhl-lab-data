CHAPTER XX. THE INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEY, URETER, ANJ) THE PERI-NEPHRIC TISSUES. We shall only deal here with the inflammatory affections that come under the care of the surgeon. They are practically all of a suppurative character, and may be divided into three classes: i. Peri-nephric suppuration; 2. Pyelitis and pyonephrosis, where the suppuration affects the pelvis of the kidney; and 3. Pyelonephritis, where the inflammation affects the substance of the kidney as well as the pelvis, and where, in some cases, such as "surgical kidney," the substance of the kidney itself is essentially the seat of the inflammatory trouble. PERI-NEPHRIC SUPPURATION. Non-suppurative inflammation of the tissues around the kidney may occur in connection with inflammation in the kidney itself, such as pyonephrosis or tuberculosis, giving rise to adhesions between the capsule of the kidney and the tissues around, or to displacements of the organ. This affects the question of nephrectomy, but does not of itself call for any special treatment. The important cases are those of peri-renal abscess. Abscesses in the peri-renal region may be due to various causes, some of them independent of disease of the kidney ; when they arise in connection with renal disease, the abscess may or may not communicate with the interior of the kidney or its pelvis. Hence we may classify peri-renal abscesses into three groups : {a) Those independent of disease of the kidney; {/') Those which occur along with inflammation of the kidney, but in which there is no communication between the abscess and the interior of the organ; and (c) Those in which the peri-renal abscess is due to a fistulous communication between the interior of the kidney and the fatty capsule. Peri-nephric suppuration independent of renal disease may follow injuries such as a blow on the loin, a strain or a punctured wound not involving the kidney. Sometimes the only history is that of a chill preceding the develop-

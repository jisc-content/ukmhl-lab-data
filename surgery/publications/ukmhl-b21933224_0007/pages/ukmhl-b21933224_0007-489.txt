461 TUBERCULOUS TESTIS. It is now generally admitted that the testes, in addition to their generative function, play a very important part in the well-being of the patient, probably by means of their internal secretion, and it is to the loss of this that the mental effects of double castration are mainly due. There is ample evidence to show that, when the vasa are blocked by inflamma- tion or divided by operation and the generative functions are thus abolished, the testes do not waste nor are the mental effects described above noticed. Experiments performed on dogs seem to show that after the removal of both testes the patient is more likely to succumb to the tubercle bacillus. Dogs previously injected with testicular fluid resist inoculation with tubercle bacilli whilst others not so prepared succumb. Epididymectomy meets to some extent the objections to the operation of castration. The testis is left and its internal secretion is therefore not interfered with and so there is no objection to operation at the earliest possible period and a similar operation will more readily be assented to should the disease re-appear on the opposite side. Moreover there is no need to urge palliative measures in opposition to operative means, such as epididymectomy, because the generative function of the affected testis is destroyed quite early in the disease by the blocking of the vas and therefore the removal of the epididymis and vas in no way affects the patient's generative power, while the early performance of the operation gives him a much greater chance of recovery.

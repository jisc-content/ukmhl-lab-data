CHAPTER LIII. INJURIES OF THE THORAX AND ITS CONTENTS. The thoracic wall or the contents of the thorax may be injured separately ■or there may be a simultaneous injury of both. INJURIES OF THE THORACIC WALL. Fractures of the ribs, the costal cartilages and the sternum have already been considered (see Chap. LIL). There is little to say concerning other injuries of the thoracic wall itself, as the importance of the case depends upon whether or not the thoracic viscera are also damaged. CONTUSIONS OF THE CHEST.—These are generally due to severe compression, as for instance in run-over accidents, from the impact of a spent bullet, from a fall, etc. The injury to the soft parts is com- paratively trifling and consists generally of a variable amount of bruising with some laceration of the muscles. The importance of the contusion of the thorax is twofold: firstly, it may be accompanied by fracture of the ribs (see Chap. LIL); secondly, there may be severe intra-thoracic damage without any fracture. The relative frequency of visceral injury without fracture of the ribs depends partly upon the age of the patient and partly on the severity and rapidity of the injury. In young children the elastic ribs will bear severe compression without fracturing, and hence in them it is not uncommon to get severe injury to the thoracic viscera Avithout fracture. The rapidity with which the blow is struck is also of importance, as slow compression of the chest wall gives rise to less damage than a sudden sharp blow, because in the former case the viscera have time to accommodate themselves to the altered shape of the chest. The contents of the thorax without undergoing any visible injury •occasionally suffer from a peculiar condition termed "concussion of the chest" or commotio thoracica, in which there is fatal collapse and on post-mortem examination no definite pathological lesions are found. This •condition is commonly attributed to direct injury of the intra-thoracic

MOVABL?: KIDNEY. i8r the suture emerging near the convex border. One or two stitches may be used for the upper pole of the organ; in the former case the capsule is perforated, say by a blunt Macewen's needle, about half-way down the inner border not too close to the hilum and then made to under-run the fibrous capsule emerging again just internal to the convex border. One end of the silk is again threaded into the needle and passed through the transversalis fascia Fig. 41.â€”Nt i'HKOi'Exv without Decok tication. The illustr.ition shows the method of passing the sutures through the w.-i!I of the loin :ifter they have been inserted through the renal capsule and the kidney returned into place. Two sutures are used here, the ends of the upper one being made to emerge from the wall of the loin as close as possible beneath the twelfth rib. The figure shows how to pass the sutures so as to allow the cut edges of the muscles 10 be approximated without undue tension on the renal stitches. from before backwards as high up as possible beneath the last rib, being made to emerge through the lumbar muscles just below the bone. The other end of the silk is then passed in a similar manner at a suitable distance from the first, and when the two ends are tied together they will pull up and fix the upper end of the kidney in its normal position. A second suture is passed through the lower end of the organ and carried through the abdominal muscles just below the line of incision, and when tied will fix the lower end of the kidney (see Fig. 41). These sutures however should not be tied until the lumbar muscles have been sutured, otherwise there may either be difficulty in bringing together the divided muscles or else, when this is done.

DIVISION IV. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST AND THORAX. SECTION I.—AFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST. CHAPTER L. DEFORMITIES, INJURIES AND INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST : SYPHILIS AND TUBERCULOSIS. DEFORMITIES OF THE BREAST. The only deformity of the breast amenable to surgical treatment is the so-called "umbilicated nipple" which is scarcely a congenital deformity, as it may develop after puberty when the breast becomes filled with fat. In it the nipple lies buried at the bottom of the circular fossa and in advanced cases may give rise to much trouble from the accumulation of dirt, epithelium and secretion. As a rule however the depression is not great and the trouble only requires treatment because of the possible difficulty in suckling. Treatment.—The minor forms of this condition are easily remedied by removing a crescentic area of .skin on each side of the nipple with its concavity towards the latter and sufficiently wide to obliterate the fossa between the skin and the nipple when its edges are sewn together (see Fig. io6). When the nipple lies buried at the bottom of a deep pit this operation may also possibly succeed but if not, it will be best to remove the nipple, if it be causing much trouble, as continued irritation of it may give rise to serious consequences. HYPERTROPHY OF THE BREAST.—This condition is not un common and one or both breasts occasionally reach an enormous size.

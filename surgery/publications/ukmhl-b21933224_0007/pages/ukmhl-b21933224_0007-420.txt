392 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA. depressed, so that its point is thrown up against and perforates the urethral roof just in front of the membranous urethra (see Fig. 83). There are three methods of passing a catheter, (a) In the first plan (see Fig. 84) the instrument is held parallel with the long axis of the body, its handle lying almost flat on the abdominal wall. The penis is held erect, the tip of the instrument is insinuated down it until the bulb Fig. 83.â€”Diagram to illustrate how a False Passage may be made by DEPRESSING THE HANDLE OF THE BouGiE PREMATURELY. In I. the point of the in- strument has been well engaged in the membranous urethra before the handle is depressed, while in 11. the handle has been depressed before the triangular ligament was reached. This causes the point to pass out through the urethral roof. The point of the bougie should not be so high as it is shown in the figure; it should be already passing behind the prostate. is reached, and then the handle is gradually raised to the vertical so as to engage the point of the instrument well in the membranous urethra. The handle is finally depressed between the thighs, and the point is made to pass upwards and forwards through the prostatic urethra into the bladder. (d) Another plan (see Fig. 85) is to introduce the instrument at right angles to the long axis of the body, generally on the left side, until the point reaches the bulb. The handle is then rotated through a quarter of a circle until the shaft lies in the middle line the handle being also

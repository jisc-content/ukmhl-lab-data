CHAPTER XLII. TRAUMATIC AND INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE PENIS. INJURIES. These are comparatively rare and take the form of contusions, punctured or incised wounds, haematomata or dislocation of the organ; the penis may also be strangulated by a ring passed over it or a ligature tied round it. Rupture or so-called " fracture" of the penis may occur and is usually caused by damage to the sheath of the corpora cavernosa from a blow upon the erect organ. The importance of this injury is that erection may be interfered with subsequently by cicatricial contraction. By the term "dislocation of the penis" is meant the rare injury in which the erectile portion of the organ has been dislocated from the skin and subcutaneous tissues and has found its way into the cellular tissue elsewhere. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. BALANITIS.â€”The mucous surface of the prepuce is readily infected by pyogenic organisms, when balanitis, characterised by a purulent discharge between the glans and the prepuce, is set up. This may be due to the irritation of retained secretion beneath a long prepuce, to dirt, to mastur- bation, to venereal or herpetic ulceration, or, most frequently, to gonorrhoea. In most cases the surface of the glans is affected as well as that of the prepuce and the term postho-balanitis has been applied to this condition. The prepuce becomes swollen and tender, and its orifice may be so narrowed that a condition of acquired phimosis is present. Micturition is painful owing to the irritation caused by urine finding its way between the glans and the prepuce. The surface of the glans when exposed is congested and has lost its superficial epithelium in places and sometimes is ulcerated. When the prepuce cannot be drawn back, the retention of discharge beneath it may give rise to extensive ulceration ending in gangrene

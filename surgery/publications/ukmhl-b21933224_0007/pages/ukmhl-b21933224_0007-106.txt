A is the line of bone section in Krasl<e's original operation, B is Hoch- enegg's, while C shows the lines of separation of the sacrum in Rydygier's osteo-plastic resection. In all cases the coccyx is removed. The skin incision is usually a median one. table is raised so as to carry the intesti; method of doing the same thing is to other surgeons have also modified say concerning these osteo-plastic operations that we are not inclined to recommend them as, although theoretically very tempting, in prac- tice the replaced fragment of bone is apt to necrose. There is no doubt that re- moval of a portion of the sacrum in addition to excision of the coccyx gives a good exposure of the lower end of the rectum and we are inclined to think that there is no advantage in confining the removal of the bone to the left side, as Kraske recommends. We are in the habit of dividing it transversely below the third sacral foramen as this gives much more room (see Fig. 19). As it is not always possible to be sure beforehand how much bone will require removal, it is well to begin by merely excising the coccyx; after exposing the rectum it will be seen how much more bone should be taken away. The steps of the operation are as follows : The patient is turned over almost on to the face with the left side of the pelvis elevated upon a pillow. A very good plan is to place a large sandbag over one end of the table and then to turn the patient over on his face so that the pelvis rests upon the sandbag, at the same time raising the left side by a smaller sandbag under the left anterior superior spine. The knees hang over the table and rest upon a chair whilst the foot of the es away from the pelvis. Another suspend the pelvis over a strap

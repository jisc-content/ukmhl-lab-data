THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER. a few sutures introduced by Lembert's method; or there may be a ragged opening extending in several directions, and possibly into the peritoneal cavity. If the opening be very irregular and contused and the urine be septic, or if the case be not seen immediately after the accident, it is well not to suture it, but to drain the bladder above the puhes (see p. 291). Under ordinary circumstances however, if the case be seen early, if the urine be aseptic, and if there be only a moderately lacerated wound, there is no objection to sewing up the rent as Fig. 60.â€”Method ok Sutl'rinc; an Kx i nA-i iiKiToNEAL Rui'Tuhe ok thk Ki.aijder. The laceration is rendered accessible by pulling up the upper extremity with a retractor, and interrupted sutures taking up the muscular coat only are inserted according to Lembert's plan. The peritoneal reflection is seen above the bladder. If preferred the suture may be continuous. accurately as possible (see Fig. 60). The most important point is to provide for the free escape of urine and blood, from the very important pre-vesical space, and therefore, whatever be done to the wound in the bladder, the greatest care should always be taken both to disinfect the pre-vesical area at the time of operation, and also to provide for the escape of discharges from it afterwards by means of large drainage tubes; otherwise septic cellulitis of a grave type will follow the extravasation of urine into it. If the rent be partly extra- and partly intra peritoneal, the repair of the intra-peritoneal portion should be undertaken first (see Fig. 61), after which.

140 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE BILE PASSAGES. the latter has been removed. Therefore cholecystectomy (see p. 143), is the best operation whenever it is possible. 3. When there are stones in a moderately healthy gall-bladder there are four methods by which the condition of affairs may be dealt with, namely, (a) cholecystotomy; (i^) cholecystostomy; (c) cholecystectomy; and (d) cholecystenterostomy.

(^Modified/rom Bcvan, Annals of Surgery.) out of hot salt solution are packed round the gall bladder so as to isolate it from all the surrounding structures. The fundus is drawn well up into or actually out of the wound, and, if the organ be distended, it is well to draw off the bulk of the fluid with a trochar and cannula so as to avoid soiling the wound when the incision is made. The fundus is now laid open and the cut edges of the incision are seized in catch forceps and pulled well up into the wound. Any bile that escapes is rapidly mopped up with suitable swabs. The stones are removed either separately with forceps or with a scoop, and the interior of the gall-bladder is explored with the finger both during and after the evacuation of the stones. When all are apparently removed the fundus is pulled well up, the opening in it is covered

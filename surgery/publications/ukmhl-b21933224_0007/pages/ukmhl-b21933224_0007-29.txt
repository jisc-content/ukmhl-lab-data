DIVISION I. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. CHAPTER I. ANATOMY OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS: METHODS OF EXAMINATION. ANATOMY. The rectum proper extends from the lower edge of the third piece of the sacrum to the anus, and is about five inches long. The " first part of the rectum," formerly described in anatomical text-books, possesses a meso-colon and is indistinguishable from the sigmoid flexure, of which it anatomically forms a part. The rectum thus defined may be divided into two portions, the rectum proper and the anal portion; the former is three to four inches long, lies in the hollow of the sacrum with its concavity forwards, and extends from the third piece of that bone to the apex of the prostate in the middle line. Below it has in front of it the trigone of the bladder, the vesiculaa seminales and the prostate in the male—with which it is in fairly intimate connection—whilst in the female the vagina and the cervix uteri are in relation with its anterior surface. Its lower extremity is supported by the levatores ani and the recto- vesical fascia. The peritoneum invests the lower part of the sigmoid flexure (the part formerly called the " first part of the rectum ") completely, but about five inches from the anus the peritoneum only covers the anterior and lateral surfaces of the gut. The lateral investment then disappears, the anterior one however extending down to within three to three and a half inches of the amis and forming the posterior wall of the recto-vesical pouch. This part of the rectum may therefore be divided into two portions, the upper PT. VI. 2 A

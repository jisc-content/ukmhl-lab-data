CHAPTER VI. PERI-RECTAL INFLAMMATION AND ITS SEQUEL^.. PERI-PROCTITIS. Inflammation may spread from the interior of the rectum through its walls into the tissues around, or it may originate in the peri-rectal tissues themselves. We shall here deal with two forms which end in suppuration, namely, diffuse suppurative peri-proctitis (in other words, septic cellulitis of the pelvis) and localised peri-rectal abscess, the so-called ischio-rectal abscess. DIFFUSE SUPPURATIVE PERI PROCTITIS.—This generally follows infection from the rectum but may occasionally arise without any injury or proctitis in alcoholics or diabetics, etc.; much more commonly it follows the opening up of the planes of cellular tissue that occurs in injuries or in operations such as excision of the rectum (especially by Kraske's method) or division of a stricture. The cellulitis commences above the insertion of the levator ani, and may spread into the cellular tissue in the hollow of the sacrum right up to the iliac fossa. The tissues become infiltrated with pus, and sloughing rapidly occurs and, should the patient survive, widespread necrosis of the tissues in the pelvis follows. Usually, however, death occurs from septi- caemia or pyaemia with metastatic abscesses in the liver. The disease usually sets in very early after an operation, sometimes the same evening, and is accompanied by high temperature, delirium and vomiting. The wound becomes exti;emely foetid and greyish in appearance and the pus is sanious, while the patient gradually falls into the typhoid condition, death occurring in from three to ten days. This form is closely allied to the idiopathic gangrenous peri-proctitis described by Mr. Furneaux Jordan.' Both are very rare. Treatment.—Nothing is of much avail when once diffuse peri-proctitis has set in, and therefore every effort must be made to obtain asepsis in British MedicalJottrnal, 1879, Vol. I., p. 73.

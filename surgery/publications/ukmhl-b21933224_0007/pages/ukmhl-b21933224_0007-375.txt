CHAPTER XXXVI..A CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS OF THE URETHRA. These conditions though of great importance are fortunately rare; the most important are hypospadias, epispadias and complete or partial occlusion of the urethra. Abnormal communications between the urethra and neighbouring structures, such as the rectum or the vagina, have already been mentioned (see p. 8). CONGENITAL STRICTURES OF THE URETHRA. Congenital strictures of the urethra are met with in various situations; for example the stricture may be at the external meatus, in the penile portion just behind the fossa navicularis, or close to the prostatic urethra, and it usually takes the form of a valvular fold or diaphragm. In the adult, the meatus will usually admit a No. 12 English bougie and in children of two or three years it should admit a No. 4 or 5 ; if it does not, it must be considered abnormally narrow. As the meatus is as narrow as any part of the canal, any instrument that can pass through the meatus should pass on into the bladder. Any constriction in the urinary passages should receive immediate attention as it exerts injurious backward pressure. TREATMENT.â€”If there be a narrowing of the external meatus, a few drops of a 5% cocaine solution should be injected into the orifice and a fine tenotome or a canaliculus knife passed until it is well beyond the constriction ; it is then made to cut downwards in the middle line until the meatus has been sufficiently enlarged to admit a full-sized instrument. If the incision be at all extensive, the cut edges of the mucous membrane are united by a stitch or two to the cutaneous surface, but when the narrowing is very slight the occasional passage of a No. 14 bougie^ will prevent contraction during healing. In some cases a much more free incision has to be made and then steps must be taken to prevent subsequent contraction by covering the cut surfaces with epithelium. When the wound is too 'This need only be about two or three inches long.

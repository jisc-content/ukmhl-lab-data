THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. gauze may be thrust in and the isolation of the bowel proceeded with but, before dividing the rectum above the growth, it is well to stitch the parietal peritoneum to the sero-muscular coat of the rectum by a few fine catgut stitches and a Hagedorn needle. Before this is done, the bowel must be drawn down to the position it will occupy after the affected portion has been excised. The gut is then cut across by a series of snips with the scissors and any vessels that spurt are picked up and twisted or tied. The next point is how to treat the cut end of the bowel. Some surgeons leave it in position at the top of the wound and allow the raw Fig. 25.â€”Separation of the Pekitoneum i'rom the front of the Rectum in Periniial Excision.

We are strongly of opinion that the latter course should be adopted wherever possible and, as we only recommend this operation for growths in the immediate neighbourhood of the anus, it should be quite feasible in the majority of cases. We would go so far as to recommend extra freeing of the bowel above the growth if necessary to effect it, or even opening the peritoneum freely and dividing its lateral reflections (see Fig. 26), the peritoneum being afterwards sutured to the bowel before the latter is cut across. We are not at all inclined to think that such a procedure renders sepsis more common. Free division of the lateral peritoneal reflections will obviate any risk of the bowel receding in any case suited for this operation. To our minds saving the patient from

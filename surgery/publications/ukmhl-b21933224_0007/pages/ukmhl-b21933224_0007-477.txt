449 ECTOPIA TESTIS. whether castration should be performed. The decision will be influenced largely by the liability of the testicle to injury in its abnormal position and also by the condition of the one on the opposite side. If this be normal and in the scrotum and if there be a history of pain and attacks of inflammation in the ectopic testicle, castration should be performed and a radical cure done if there be a femoral hernia. If on the other hand the other testicle be imperfect, the surgeon will hesitate to perform castration and will not do so unless there be a history of repeated attacks of inflammation in it. When the testicle merely lies in the crural canal, the organ can be replaced in position by opening up the inguinal canal and pulling the testis out from the crural canal and replacing it as recommended for an imperfectly descended organ.

METHODS OF EXAMINATION. 7 scope"—is a cylinder, 5^ inches long, with a blunt obturator (see Fig. 5), which is introduced within the anus for about two inches j then the obturator is withdrawn, air passes in and expands the lower part of the bowel, and at least the whole of the lower two inches of the mucous membrane of the rectum may be inspected as the speculum is gently withdrawn. The speculum should be pushed slightly upwards every now and then, so as to stretch the mucous membrane and to open out its folds. Reflected light from a forehead mirror is necessary for this examination. Fig. 5.—Kelly's Rectal Specula. For examination of the bowel higher up the patient is put in the knee- chest position and a speculum—called the " long proctoscope "—about an inch in diameter and eight inches in length, is carefully introduced as high up as it will go. As the obturator is withdrawn air distends the rectum so that, with good illumination and by varying the position of the orifice of the speculum, the entire mucous membrane can be thoroughly inspected. Kelly also uses a still longer speculum that he calls the " sigmoidoscope," and this instrument, which is 14 inches long, he states that he has introduced 12 inches beyond the anus. The introduction of this instrument must be effected with great gentleness. As it progresses upwards its point is directed to the patient's left. A fourth speculum, termed by Kelly the " sphinctero- scope," is a much shorter tube for examining the sphincteric area. In addition to this physical examination, careful enquiries of course must be made as to the character of the stools, the existence and nature of discharges from the rectum, the occurrence of any protrusion during defsecation, etc. All these points will be referred to later.

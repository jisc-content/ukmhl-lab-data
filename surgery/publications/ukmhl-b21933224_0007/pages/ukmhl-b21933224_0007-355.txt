327 TUBERCULOUS DISEASE. if all the cheesy material has been scraped out, but a sinus may remain for some time, and it may be necessary to open up the wound again and scrape it out. In very obstinate cases of perineal urinary fistula due to this cause, a supra-pubic cystotomy may be done with advantage so as to stop the flow of urine over the cavity. The more elaborate operation of excision of the prostrate would only be justifiable if the affection could be attacked sufficiently early to enable the whole focus of disease to be removed, provided always that the surgeon is sure that there is no similar disease elsewhere. Theoretically, of course, this measure is the proper procedure, and it can be fairly easily done through a curved perineal incision. In practice however the surgeon will never be sufficiently sure that the disease is primary to justify operative procedures that would undoubtedly be too severe for the patient if the disease were secondary to genito-urinary tuberculosis elsewhere. When however the abscess has burst into the rectum, a perineal incision should be avoided, because a rectal fistula would be almost certain to result. It is better to dilate the anus and enlarge the opening of the abscess into the rectum, scraping out the cheesy deposit from it.

277 FOREIGN IJODIES IN THE BLADDER. Symptoms.—The .symptoms to which they give rise are mainly those of cystitis (see Chap. XXVIII.), and later on of stone (see Chap. XXXI.). The diagnosis is easily made if the true history can be obtained; failing that, inspection by the cystoscope in the male or the endoscope in the female will display the foreign body, and its nature can readily be recognised if seen before it becomes encrusted. Should it have become the nucleus of a stone, its peculiar shape will often lead to a suspicion of its true nature. Treatment.—A foreign body in the bladder should be removed as soon as possible, and its removal is comparatively easy in the female, in whom it is perhaps more common than in the male, and in whom the urethra may be dilated, and the body removed by suitable forceps ; it will hardly ever be large enough to require any cutting operation. In the male however the case is different. In certain cases, e.g. when a piece of catheter is in the bladder, a lithotrite may be used, and it may be necessary to break up the foreign body with it before it can be extracted safely; if the body be quite small it may be washed into the eye of a large evacuating catheter. When the body is sharp-pointed, or when its removal by a lithotrite is likely to damage the bladder, the .safest way is to do a median perineal cystotomy, to feel the foreign body with the finger and remove it with suitable forceps; this is better than a supra-pubic opening as the wound heals more rapidly. Should the body be too large for extraction in this manner however, a supra-pubic cystotomy must be performed, and this will be the operation of choice if one be required in the female. These operations are described elsewhere (see Chap. XXXI.).

6o THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. bed for 24 hours at least, lying upon one side with the buttocks slightly raised upon a pillow so as to prevent the mass coming down again. The bowels should also be confined for a day or two. Should this manipulation fail to reduce the piles, the best plan is to apply hot boracic fomentations, which in this particular region is best done by wringing a soft sponge out of boracic lotion as hot as it can be borne, apply- ing it to the anus, covering it over with a large mass of cotton wool and renewing it as frequently as it gets cold. This method will be most commonly used in cases of a large inflamed mass of mixed internal and external piles where reduction is out of the question, as any attempt to push these mixed piles up above the sphincter only gives rise to great pain and causes increased inflammation from the spasmodic contraction of the sphincter upon them. Unless this treatment rapidly relieves the swelling, operation should be urged, even in the face of considerable contra-indications, as the risk is much less than that of allowmg the piles to become gangrenous, which is what will probably occur. The treatment of gangrenous piles is identical with that of the inflamed irreducible variety just mentioned and consists in their immediate removal by the clamp and cautery or by the application of hot fomentations, etc., if operation be refused or be thought inadvisable. Considerable quantities of morphine will be required to allay the acute pain present in these cases. The treatment of isolated thrombosed piles, which generally are of the external variety, has already been dealt with (see p. 50).

CHAPTER XLIII. pp. VI. 2. 2 K NEW GROWTHS OF THE PENIS. The only important growths affecting the penis are papilloma and epithelioma. PENILE WARTS. These are common complications of gonorrhoea ; they are probably not due to the gonococcus itself but are caused by the irritating discharge. They also occur in connection with frequent attacks of balanitis. Gonorrhoeal warts are exceedingly common in the female in whom they may cover the entire vulva; in the male they may also be met with about the cicatrices of soft sores. The growths require to be distinguished from condylomata, especially in the female; this is readily done by noticing their pedunculated character, their characteristic papillae and the absence of any tendency to undergo ulceration. TREATMENT.â€”The most satisfactory method is to snip the growth away. Single warts may be snipped off with a pair of scissors curved upon the flat and the bleeding stopped by a nitrate of silver point. Small isolated gonorrhoeal warts occasionally heal satisfactorily if they are kept clean and dusted with equal parts of oxide of zinc, calomel and starch, but removal with scissors is a quicker plan. When the area affected is very extensive and it is desirable to avoid leaving a large raw surface, the warts may occasionally be made to disappear by keeping them dry and painting them daily or every other day with salicylic collodion (loo grains of salicylic acid to the ounce of flexile collodion). EPITHELIOMA OF THE PENIS. This is the common form of malignant disease of this organ and it commences more frequently upon the glans than upon the prepuce. It usually commences in the .sulcus behind the corona, but it may occur at the preputial ring. Phimosis apparently plays an important part in the

CHAPTER XLV. ABNORMALITIES IN THE DESCENT OF THE TESTIS. Abnormalities in the descent of the testis are the only developmental defects of the organ that are amenable to treatment. They may be divided into two large groups, one of which is termed retained or imperfectly descended testis, and the other ectopia testis, in which the organ has found its way into some abnormal position. RETAINED TESTIS. The testis may be arrested in any part of its course from the abdomen to the bottom of the scrotum, and in some cases it does not enter the inguinal canal at all; the condition may be unilateral or bilateral. Different views are held as to the cause of this, but they need not concern us here as they have no bearing upon treatment. When the testes lie in the inguinal canal the funicular process of peritoneum which descends with them is practically always open and therefore the majority of cases are complicated with a congenital inguinal hernia. Even when a hernia is not actually present at first it is always liable to occur later on. Testes in an abnormal position are usually imperfectly developed and some hold that they are incapable of discharging their functions when they lie in the inguinal canal; this point however is not quite certain and it would appear that if the testicles be brought down into the scrotum sufficiendy early in life they may enlarge and discharge their functions satisfactorily. This condition possesses a variety of risks. Besides the fact that the organ is possibly functionally useless, a congenital hernia is very likely to accompany it. The testicle is also very prone to attacks of acute inflammation not only from the causes that give rise to a similar condition in the normally placed organ but apparently from the pressure to which the displaced one is constantly subjected and from the greater liability to injury from sudden movements, such as violent flexion of the hip joint and blows or kicks

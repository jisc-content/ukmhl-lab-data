31 TUBERCULOSIS. be required. Partial excision, scraping or cauterising with pure carbolic or lactic acid or the application of solid nitrate of silver may be tried according to the e.xtent and situation of the ulceration. For pain, an ointment con- taining iodoform and cocaine is the best. Jti the true rectal for/n of the disease, when the ulcer has not yet penetrated the wall of the bowel, the anus should be fully dilated and the ulcers, if not numerous, thoroughly curetted and cauterised either with the actual cautery or with lactic acid; occasionally dilatation of the anus, followed by the application of a strong solution of lactic acid (20 per cent.) or the introduction of ointments containing iodoform or balsam of Peru by means of a rectal syringe (see Fig. 10) will lead to a cure in the slighter cases. These true rectal cases, however, are very serious and difficult to cure, as the ulcers are very numerous and extensive. We have had a most successful case in which it was necessary to excise the entire lower part of the mucous membrane and sub-mucous tissues of the rectum, as in Whitehead's operation for piles (see Chap. VIII.). By this means a most extensive and intractable condition was perfectly cured.

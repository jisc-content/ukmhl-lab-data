330 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE PROSTATE. may burst into the rectum or. the bladder, or it may make its way down behind the prostate and burst in the perineum. Tuberculous peritonitis and tuberculous cystitis are apt to follow extension of the disease in this region, whilst the prostate will almost invariably become involved. Treatment.â€”The surgical treatment is practically entirely limited to cases in which suppuration has occurred, although some surgeons have per- formed elaborate operations for the removal of tuberculous vesiculse seminales before suppuration has taken place. It is doubtful, however, whether an operation of this kind should ever be performed, as it must be very extensive and the affection is usually secondary and therefore does not warrant it. As soon as suppuration in the neighbourhood of the vesiculae seminales is discovered, a perineal incision should be made and the surgeon should work his way behind the prostate towards the abscess, so as to evacuate it by the perineum and thus avoid the risk of its bursting into the rectum or bladder or both. The procedure is quite similar to that for tuberculous disease of the prostate (see p. 326) except that the separation must be carried on between the prostate and the rectum until the abscess cavity is reached.

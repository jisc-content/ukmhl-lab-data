EPITHELIOMA. 437 After arresting bleeding, a drainage tube is inserted at the anterior angle and the two halves of the scrotum are united by interrupted sutures of catgut or silkworm gut right down to the posterior end of the perineal incision, to the extremity of which the urethra is sutured after being slit on its upper and lower surfaces as in the other method of amputation. Gauze dressings are applied and are kept in position by a T-bandage. The patient micturates normally, the dressings being removed and renewed every time he does so. The functional result of this operation is much better than that of the other method. The patient does not wet himself, whereas in cases of amputation in front of the scrotum the urine is very apt to spray out and set up eczema scroti. In both these operations the glands in the groin should be removed if enlarged. When however infected glands extend into the iliac fossa, amputation of the penis is contra-indicated except possibly when the local trouble is very severe. In that case the object of the amputation is merely to get rid of the local disease and so to allow the patient to micturate in comfort. In cases in which amputation of the penis is considered inadvisable, either owing to the extent of the disease or to other causes, the patient, if he suffers much on micturition, will be relieved by a median* perineal section (see p. 371); it is a good plan in these cases to expose the urethra, divide it across and then to isolate the proximal end and bring it out into the perineal opening. This will not only obviate passing urine over the ulcerated surface of the growth but it will avoid any necessity for the use of a perineal catheter, as there is then no tendency for the perineal wound to close; moreover, urine cannot find its way along the penile urethra to the growth.

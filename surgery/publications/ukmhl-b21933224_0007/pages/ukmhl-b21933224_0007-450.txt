SECTION IV.—AFFECTIONS OF THE PENIS, TESTES AND SCROTUM. CHAPTER XLI. PHIMOSIS AND PARAPHIMOSIS. PHIMOSIS. By the term phimosis is meant an inabihty to draw the prepuce back over the corona glandis. The condition may be congenital or acquired and varies in degree from a mere pinhole to just enough constriction to prevent the entire glans being exposed. CONGENITAL PHIMOSIS.—In the congenital form the chief trouble is at the preputial ring, i.e. the junction of the mucous and cutaneous surfaces, and there are moreover practically always adhesions between the prepuce and the glans, which may be firm and dense, so that their separation leaves a raw surface, or may be so slight that the two structures may be peeled apart without causing any bleeding. In some cases the difficulty in retracting the prepuce is entirely due to these adhesions and not to too narrow a preputial orifice. In congenital phimosis the prepuce is nearly always unduly long, but not invariably so. The condition is accompanied by an accumulation of smegma beneath the prepuce which, although it may give rise to some slight irritation from its mere presence, does not necessarily cause balanitis unless pyogenic organisms find entry. This however is .almost certain to occur as the child grows older," and then balanitis of a very severe type may set in. There may be difficulty in micturition when the preputial orifice is very narrow and this may lead to undue frequency which in bad cases may amount almost to incontinence. There may also be straining on micturition which predisposes to hernia and may produce prolapse of the rectum. The reflex irritation due to the adhesions may be very marked and is a frequent cause of masturbation as the child gets older, whilst in adult life very

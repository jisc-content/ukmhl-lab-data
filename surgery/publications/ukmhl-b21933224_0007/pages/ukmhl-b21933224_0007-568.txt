CHAPTER LV. THE INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS AMENABLE TO SURGICAL TREATMENT. This subject is still in its infancy and is full of difficulty; its full dis- cussion really involves the medical aspects of the cases as well. We must therefore refer the reader to some special work upon the subject ^ for the points that are omitted here. THE TREATMENT OF PULMONARY CAVITIES. This may be called for under the following conditions: i. Abscess of the lung following pneumonia; 2.' Bronchiectatic cavities; 3. Tuber- culous vomicae; 4. Chronic non-tuberculous lung cavities; 5. Abscesses due to foreign bodies in the lung or the smaller bronchi. ACUTE ABSCESS FOLLOWING PNEUMONIA.â€”An abscess of this kind is often accompanied by gangrene of the lung and should always be drained from outside unless it bursts into the bronchus and is completely evacuated by that route. Whenever a pneumonic abscess bursts into the bronchus it is well to wait for a few days and see whether the condition improves. Should it fail to do so, surgical inter- ference becomes urgent, as otherwise the patient will go downhill as a result of the insufficient drainage and the burrowing of the abscess in various directions in the lung. These abscesses are often multiple and their localisation is extremely difficult, owing to the consolidation of the lung that is present. The patient expectorates sputum containing gangrenous lung tissue of an offensive odour, which is so exceedingly typical that it can hardly be mistaken. As to the exact localisation of the abscess medical text-books ' Such for instance as Diseases of the Lunsrs by J. K. Fowler and R. J. Godlee: Longmans, Green & Co., London, 1898, from which most of the following points are taken.

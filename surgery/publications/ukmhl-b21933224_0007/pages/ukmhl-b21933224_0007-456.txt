428 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE PENIS. of the organ behind the constriction (see Fig. 99), The thumbs are placed over the glans and gradually knead that structure back through the preputial Fio. gg.—Reduction of a Paraphimosis. This shows the position of the fingers behind the oedematous prepuce and also the way in which the thumbs are used to knead the glans back through the constriction. opening, which is pulled forward by the fingers behind it. If there be con- siderable cedema, a few punctures may be made with a fine tenotomy knife Fig. 100.—How to divide the constriction in Paraphimosis. The glans is well bent down so as to expose the constricting band, which is then nicked in two places, as shown in the figure. in the oedematous fold in front of the constriction and the fluid allowed to escape.^ This procedure is very painful and may .require an anaesthetic. manoeuvre recommended by the late Mr. Arthur Durham may be useful in these cases. The penis is encircled from the apex of the glans to the root with a bandage of tape or narrow elastic webbing. This is applied especially firmly about the glans and the oedematous fold and is designed to drive out the fluid from the swollen end of the organ. It is kept on for two or three minutes, when it is suddenly withdrawn and the procedure recommended above for the reduction of the paraphimosis is carried out as rapidly as possible. The compression diminishes the size of the parts and in this way the glans may be rapidly thrust back through the preputial ring.

221 TUBERCULOSIS. the peritoneum is defined in front of it, and gradually separated forwards until the posterior wall of the bladder is reached, when the ureter is identified, adherent as usual to the under surface of the peritoneum. I'he patient should be turned on the sound side, so^ that the rectum falls away from the region operated upon and the pelvis should be well raised so as to carry the parts somewhat upwards. The ureter is carefully isolated both from the peritoneum and the base of the bladder, divided between ligatures as before, the open end treated as described above, and the wound sutured after providing for drainage in case of infection, owing to the near neighbourhood of the anus. In females the operation is more difificult on account of the broad ligament, and some surgeons have recommended resection of the sacrum, in order to give more room. This is done as for Kraske's operation (see p. 77). The vaginal route is not to be recommended for a tuberculous ureter, although it may be employed for an impacted stone (see p. 235).

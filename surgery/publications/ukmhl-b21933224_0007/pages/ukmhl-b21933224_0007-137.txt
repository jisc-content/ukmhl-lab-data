INJURIES. 109 drainage tube passes through the soft parts. As a rule it will be advisable to complete the last stages of the Operation as rapidly as possible owing to the exhausted condition of the patient, and probably careful suture of the abdominal wall in layers will have to be abandoned in favour of a few mattress sutures taking up the peritoneum and muscles together, the skin being united by a continuous silk stitch. When there is a large lacerated area with extensions in various directions, the bleeding cannot be controlled in this manner and it will be necessary to have recourse to firm packing of the wound. Attempts may be made to Fig. 28.â€”Method of suturing a Laceration ok the antkkior uorder of THE Liver. The two upper sketches show the steps of the uitroduction of the mattress suture while the lowest one shows this suture tied and the capsule united by a continuous stitch. under-run and tie any particularly large bleeding vessels, but the remainder of the haemorrhage must be controlled by packing strips of cyanide gauze as firmly as possible into every recess of the oozing surface. The end of the packing is brought out through the abdominal wall, which is left open for the purpose and, when the bleeding is free, the amount of packing must be large and pressure must be further exerted by a large pad of dressing externally. Packing must of course be rather doubtful in its results as there is no firm point to press against, but under these circumstances it is the only thing that can be done. In free oozing of this kind the deeper portion of the packing in contact with the raw surface may be steeped in adrenalin chloride (i-iooo) or a ten-volume per cent, solution of peroxide of hydrogen, so as to get a stronger htemostatic effect.

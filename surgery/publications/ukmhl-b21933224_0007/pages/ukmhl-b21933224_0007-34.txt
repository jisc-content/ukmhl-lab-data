THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. 6 To examine the rectum higher up, however, it is well to administer an anaesthetic and to dilate the anal orifice fully. This is done by means of the fingers which gradually stretch the muscular fibres without rupturing them (see Fig. 4). The two forefingers are first introduced into the anus and are gradually and firmly separated and at the same time swept round and round the lower end of the bowel. When a little dilatation has been effected, three fingers may be inserted on each side and hooked well above the internal sphincter. They are then gradually separated until they touch the tuber ischii on each side. After this it will be found that two or three \ \ fingers can be readily introduced into the rectum and also specula of sufficient size. Examination by the hand insinuated into the rectum, although much recommended at one time, is unsatisfactory. It is apt to produce undue distension and even tearing of the tissues, while the fingers are cramped and can really gain very little information. To complete the examination of the rectum, proper specula should be used, of which the best are those devised by Kelly of Baltimore. The lower part of the rectum is best, seen with the patient in an exaggerated lithotomy position; for examination of the upper part the knee-chest position must be employed, and in both instances full aneesthesia is advis- able. The speculum for the lower part of the rectumâ€”or "short procto-

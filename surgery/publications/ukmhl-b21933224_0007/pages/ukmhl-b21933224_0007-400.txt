372 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA. its end is made prominent in the perineum by carrying the handle somewhat backwards towards^ the abdomen. The point is cut down upon in the perineum through an incision in the middle Hne, an inch to an inch and a half long, terminating about half an inch in front of the anus. The urethra is opened by a clean cut upon the end of the groove, the edges are seized with catch forceps and retracted, when the foreign body can generally be seen by the aid of a good light and may be grasped in forceps and removed without any damage to the urethral mucous membrane. The urethral incision may be either left to close spontaneously, or may be appraximated by a few fine catgut sutures. We prefer the latter method and do not leave a catheter permanently in the bladder, but pass a No. 8 gum-elastic instrument every six hours for the first two or three days so as to draw off the urine. This can be done without risk to the union of the incision in the floor of the urethra if care be taken to keep the point in constant contact with the roof. No sutures are inserted in the skin wound; an antiseptic dressing is merely applied over it, and after the third day the patient may be allowed to micturate normally.

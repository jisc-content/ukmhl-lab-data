367 RUPTURED URETHRA. (b) Of long-standing" cases.â€”When operative procedures have not been undertaken in the first instance, but are called for after the lapse of some time on account of the occurrence of sepsis, the procedure is practically the same. A catheter must be got into the bladder, either from the meatus or if necessary after supra-pubic cystotomy, but there is here no possibility of suturing the rent in the urethra. After the catheter has been tied in position all that can be done is to introduce a drainage tube down to the defect and pack the wound around it, carrying out the after-treatment as above described. Extensive extravasation of urine may have occurred in the perineum by the time the patient is seen ; the subject of extravasation of urine is dealt with separately (see Chap. XL.). When extravasation occurs very soon after the accident in these particular cases immediate perineal section is urgently called for, and a catheter must be tied into the bladder as recom- mended above, and the urethra repaired if possible. This will often be feasible in these cases as the extravasation is recent and the urine is pro- bably not yet septic, and may be drained away freely through the perineal incision and septic infection thus avoided. Should extravasation of urine have e.xisted for some time, and should symptoms of phlegmonous inflam- mation have set in, the case must be treated on the lines recommended for extravasation of urine (see Chap. XL.).

CHAPTER XLVI. TRAUMATIC AND INFLAxMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE TESTIS. INJURIES. Punctured or incised wounds of the testis call for no special description; their treatment is similar to that of wounds in general. CONTUSIONS OF THE TESTIS.—When the testicle is bruised, haemorrhage occurs beneath the tunica albuginea and, if this be extensive and allowed to remain, complete atrophy of the testis may follow. After the accident there is rapid swelling of the organ, accompanied by intense pain, some collapse and a feeling of sickness. The pain is so severe in bad cases as to cause the patient intense agony. Treatment.—In very slight cases the application of iced lotions or an ice-bag may be sufficient, but if there be any marked extravasation it is essential to allow it to escape in order to avoid atrophy of the testis. This is quite readily done by making an incision through the tunica albuginea and may if preferred be done by a tenotomy knife introduced through the scrotum over the body of the organ. This allows blood- clot or oozing blood to escape, and healing occurs in a very short time if the wound be kept aseptic. LACERATED WOUNDS.—When the testis is lacerated the best treatment is probably to remove the organ at once as, when the injury has been so severe as to divide the skin and rupture the tunica vaginalis, the testis will in all probability be hopelessly injured. Moreover, sepsis is almost certain to occur and great risk and trouble will be saved by proceeding at once to castration. The contused edges of the wound in the soft parts should be excised at the same time. TORSION OF THE TESTIS.—A number of cases have now been operated upon in which the testicle has been twisted to such an extent that its blood supply is cut off and gangrene occurs; this is especially likely to occur in an imperfectly descended testis when the organ hangs

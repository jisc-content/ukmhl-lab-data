55 H/EMORRHOIDS. Before this is done it is well to smear the buttocks thickly with vaseline or some ordinary ointment so as to prevent scorching from the proximity of the cautery, and we have found it a good plan in addition to surround the parts with a towel which still further protects the skin of the buttocks. A cautery of suitable shape (see Fig. 14. C) is then applied at a dull red heat and made to sear off the pile gradually (see Fig. 15). It is best not to snip off the portion of the pile projecting beyond the clamp before applying Ci.A.M]' AND Cautkkn- Oi'Euation FOR Pii.F.s. The figure shows the method of searing ofT the pile .nfter it has been pulled down Ijy the ring forceps and secured in the clamp. The parts are protected from the heat of the cautery by a towel thrown over them. the cautery, as is sometimes done ; by searing off the whole mass a thicker eschar is obtained and bleeding is more effectually guarded against. When the projecting portion of the pile has been burnt off, the seared surface is dried and a second cautery at a very low red heat is rubbed well over it. This should be done slowly and thoroughly so as to obtain the thickest possible eschar and is the best preventive against bleeding. A Paquelin cautery is unsuitable for this operation, as it is very difficult to keep it at the low heat that is required. If a cautery be used hotter than at a dull red heat It cuts like a knife, does not sear the vessels properly, and there may be troublesome haemorrhage when the clamp is relaxed. We always heat our cauteries in an ordinary fire or at the flame of a Bunsen lamp if available.

IMPERFORATE ANUS AND RECTUM. side of the anal incision. The bowel is now incised and the meconium allowed to escape. If the gut can be drawn down close to the skin it may be possible to suture the cut edge of the mucous membrane to the skin margin B Fig. 7.â€”The Mhthod of Oi'iiNiNt; an Imperforate Anus. The first stage is shown in A. Here the blind end of the rectum has been exposed, .-ind before it is opened four sutures are passed, as seen in the diagram, in order to pull the bowel as far down as possible. B shows the method of suturing the mucous membrane to the skin after the bowel has been opened. The finer sutuies are those seen in A, while the coarser ones, marked by the arrows, are those passing through the whole thickness of the rectal wall and uniting it to the skin. The centre suture of the three is in the act of being passed, in the upper one the thread h.is been seized and pulled out as a loop prep.aratory to being divided, while in the lowest one the loop has been divided and two sutures result. with a few points of silkworm gut (see Fig. 7). A piece of oiled lint or a small drainage tube is then introduced into the bowel so as to keep the cut surfaces apart. In three or four days dilatation is commenced and kept up by insinuating a well-oiled little finger into the bowel, and this must be con- tinued for a long time so as to prevent contraction {vide supra).

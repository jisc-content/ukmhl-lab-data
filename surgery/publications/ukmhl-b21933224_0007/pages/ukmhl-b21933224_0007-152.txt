124 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE LIVER. without withdrawing the pins, in order to see whether the hsemorrhage has been effectually controlled. Any bleeding spot can be dealt with readily by a fresh application of the cautery, and when this has been satisfactorily done the ligature is removed; the pins however are allowed to remain for a few days, partly to keep the liver well up in the wound, and partly also to enable the ligature to be reapplied should htemorrhage recur. If the cautery be insufficient to check the htemorrhage, the elastic ligature may be reapplied and kept on, large antiseptic dressings being applied outside, the pins and ligature, with the constricted portion beyond, being allowed to separate by ulceration. Healing then occurs by granulation in the ordinary way. and may, if necessary, be hastened by the application of Thiersch's grafts. In one case Keen removed a carcinomatous left lobe of the liver entirely with a Paquelin cautery, the only trouble met with being during the division of the large veins. He arrested the bleeding temporarily by digital pressure, and finally under-ran the main bleeding points and secured them satisfac- torily. The wound was packed with iodoformed gauze, which was removed in the course of two or three days.

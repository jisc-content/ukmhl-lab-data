16 the other side of the question. Before leaving this extremely interesting subject, I cannot avoid refemng to two circumstances in connexion with the treatment of hernia; most sm-geons re- cognize the teiTible results which ensue from delaying an operation too long. Nevertheless, it is even now necessary to enforce the gi-eat tmth, that delay is dangerous, still the more decided average of success after operation for hernia, shows that the truth is practically appreciated. The other point alluded to is, the treatment of cases after the operation has been perfonned, and here a great imi^rovement has taken place within the last few years, in consequence of a more correct knowledge of the pathology, and of the ti-eatment of abdominal inflammations in general; the majority of practi- tioners now recognize the great importance of keeping the inflamed parts at perfect rest, and of ti'anquillizing the nervous and vascular system ; it is no longer considered necessary that a portion of bowel which had been constricted and imtated for hours or days, should, immediately after it has been liberated, be further irritated and exposed to mischief by the action of purgatives, nor is it deemed prudent that large absti-actions of blood should be made for the purpose of preventing or remedy- ing peritoneal or intestinal inflammation. Thus, instead of giving castor oil or colocynth soon after the operation for hernia, the surgeon allows nature to take its course, giving time for the injured intestine to repair itself, and if signs of inflam- mation do come on, he depends upon opium as his sheet anchor instead of prostrating his patient by copious, local, and general blood-letting, or by profuse salivation. Our knowledge of the pathology and treatment of the sm'gical diseases of the urinary organs, has been much extended and improved within the last few years, altliough as yet, neither chemists nor surgeons have found out a method of destroying stone in the bladder, except by operative process; nevertheless, the introduction of lithotinty must be looked upon as an im- proved means of treating this affection, calculated as it is in a great measure to supersede the apj^arently more formidable operation of cutting into the bladder. Although surgery is in- debted chiefly to Civiale for this gi-eat addition to its resources, our own countrymen Brodie, Liston, and Fcrgusson, have con- tributed greatly to its adoption in England; but it must be con- fessed notwithstanding, that we have not yet been enabled to

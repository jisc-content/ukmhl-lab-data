23 clocti-iues and opinions, and by his masterly use of the English language, to hand down to all seekers after truth, the richest treasures of surgical lore. Before bringing to a close the very desultory and imperfect obsers'ations -which I have brought before you, 1 cannot ^omit a reference to the condition of the Medical Society of London, which has now been instituted upwards of eighty years. All of us have reason to rejoice at its present prosperity, both in a financial point of view, and as regards the numbers of those belongin gto it, many of whom are men who have taken a high position in their profession, and amongst whom can be found those devoting their best energies to the investigation of disease and the furtherance of science. I need not mention the names of these gentlemen, in fact they would be too numerous. To some of those, who have done much service to surgical science, I have already refeiTed"; there are many who have striven equally as Avell in the other depaiiments of our noble profes- sion.

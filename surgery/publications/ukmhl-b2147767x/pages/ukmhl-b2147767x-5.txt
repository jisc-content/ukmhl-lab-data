7 and opportunities incline them to the almost exclusive pursuit of the last-mentioned department of science. My own op- portunities and inclinations have led me this way, and on look- ing for a subject for consideration on this occasion, I have thought it would be most appropriate for me to request your attention to soroe of the great improvements which have been made in this direction of late years, and more especially to refer to the labours of those belonging to the Medical Society of London, who have contributed to the advancement of surgery. The present age is, perhaps, the most remarkable the world ever saw, and at no other period has the spread of science been so great as at present. Most truly have the words of the in- spired prophet come to pass, " Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased;" and he who thinks seriously must feel it a privilege to live in such an age. In our own science these great improvements are as well marked as in eveiy other depaitment of learning, and more especially, per- haps, have these advances been made within the last few years, and all who are acquainted with surgery, as practised by our forefathers, will admit that the most rapid stiides have been made towards rendering it more scientific, more simple, and more effectual. It would be out of the question for me to refer to the majjo- rity even of the improvements which have tended to simplify and render more accurate the science and practice of surgery; I must content myself with a reference to those which are most marked, and especially those with which the names of Fellows of this Society are connected. In the first place, I may state, that guided by more correct physiological and pathological data, we have, within late years, arrived at a much better knowledge of the phenomena of in- flammation, and of the treatment which is best adapted to pre- vent it, and to subdue it and its results. Inflammation is not now looked upon as merely an accumulation of blood in the part affected, or an excited action of vessels attended by a more vigorous state of the circulation at large. Not many years ago the opinions entertained upon this point were unsound and mi- scientific, and were consequently followed by eiToneous prac- tice. To combat inflammation of any kind soever, whether simple, erysipelatous, or traumatic, the use of bloodletting and

6 was so suddenly taken from us. Most of us have listened to his eloquence in debate, which shone forth in such clear and forcible language, and I need not say how. well he, above all others, would have accomplished the task which it is my duty this day to fulfil. It is, however, a mournful satisfaction for us, whilst reflecting upon his premature end, to know that death found him earnestly following his scientific pursuits, and en- gaged in acts of philanthropy and true heroism. His early de- cease was a loss to the whole profession, but more especially to this influential Society, of which I may truly say he was one of the greatest ornaments. You will, I am sure, not think it unbecoming in me to make this brief allusion to our departed friend, and probably you will be the more indulgent towards myself when you consider in whose place I now stand, and how unworthy I am to hold the position which he, had life been spared, would have this day occupied, and the duties of which he would have so gracefully and so ably fulfilled. I shall dwell no longer upon this melancholy topic, but at once proceed to the task which has been more especially im- posed upon me ; and here I must express to you the diflSculty •which besets me on choosing a subject worthy of the occasion; and I am sure you will give me credit for speaking the tmth, when I state that the difiiculties I labour under are great and peculiar—great, on account of my deficiency and inexperience, peculiar on account of the composition of my audience, which contains many who are eminently versed, both in theoretical and practical skill, and whose professional tastes and inclina- tions widely differ. Eveiy follower of medical science has one common object in view, and this is to do all he can to relieve human suffering, and to combat the ravages of disease in whatsoever form the many-headed foe presents itself. The cultivator of pure medi- cine, the obstetrician, and the surgeon who heartily engages in his own particular sphere, follows the same profession, which is in reality one and undivided, and each must necessarily feel an interest in what the other undertakes; for the studies which form the basis of all medical knowledge are identical. Some here present are engaged more especially in pure medical science and practice, others follow the no less important path of obstetric medicine and surgery, and a third class belongs to those who combine both of these with surgery, or whose tastes

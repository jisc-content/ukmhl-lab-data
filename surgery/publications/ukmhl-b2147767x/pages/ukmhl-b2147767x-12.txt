14 sion the way in which the cure of an aneurism might be effected; and this discovery must be looked upon as one of the greatest events in the history of surgery; but admirable and beautiful as was the suggestion of Hunter, which has been acted upon with the greatest success for many years, there yet remained to be pointed out a method of treating aneurism, which, based upon the same views is even more simple, and probably will prove to be more effectual. It is only within the last ten years, that the treatment of aneurism by compression can be said to have been placed in our list of surgical remedies. It had, indeed, been tried by others, but it was not until some of our eminent bre- thren in Dublin had investigated the subject, that it was brought prominently forward; the results, however, of their trials of compression, soon convinced a portion of the surgical world, that the treatment was worthy of confidence, and although from some quarters much opposition has arisen, it has been found that it is a more safe mode of treatment than that by the liga- ture, and one equally as effectual. A very large number of published cases proves this, and although compression cannot be employed in many instances, such as anemism of the cai'otids of the subclavian, and of the external or internal iliac, it is likely to supersede the use of the knife and ligature in the ma- jority of cases where the vessels of the exti'emities are diseased. This must be looked upon as a great achievement in the surgery of the present age; and the names of Hutton, of Cu- sack, and of Bellingham, will ever be honourably connected with the modern treatment of aneurism. Much interest and importance is attached to hernia as a surgical disease, on account, in the first place, of its extreme frequency of occm'rence in othemise healthy and able-bodied persons, and secondly, because so much of the success which results from treatment, depends upon a correct appreciation of its anatomy and pathology, and upon a right and timeous use of those measures which are at the surgeon's disposal. The researches of Pott, of Sir Astley Cooper, and of Lawrence, went far to simplify the subject; and a vast deal of light was thrown upon the true anatomy and pathology of hernia by their inves- tigations, and the treatment of the disease under its vaiying conditions was greatly improved. At a later period, the excel- lent surgeon who is now the official head of the surgical profes- sion, showed that the results of operations performed for

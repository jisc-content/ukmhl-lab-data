18 My colleague, Mr. Wade, has devoted a great deal of atten- tion to the investigation of the merits of potassa fusa, as an agent in the treatment of certain obstinate cases of stricture ; and it is my sincere conviction, after a considerable trial of this remedy, that if it were more fully used, there would not have been any occasion for the prolonged and angry discussions which have of late been carried on regarding the merits and demerits of the perineal section. It now remains for me to speak of the progress which has of late been made in that department of the art, which is appro- priately termed operative surgery ; for here indeed have the most rapid strides been made, and in some instances it appears as though we had an'ived almost at perfection, as far as this term can be applied to anything that man undertakes. It is impossible for one who has rendered himself familiar with the history of operative surgery of bygone years, and who contrasts it with its present condition, not to feel that it has been eminently advanced by the surgeons of the present age. It is true, that the operative is looked upon as the coarser and less scientific branch of sm'gery, and it is the habit among many to decry it, and to deny to those who have been and are most distinguished in using the knife, those mental endowments which are so necessary in a man who wishes to shine in any walk of the medical profession. It must be confessed, that for the mere purpose of executing operations, the higher qualities of the mind are not called into play so much as when the at- tention is directed to the investigation of the more abstruse points of pathology and medical practice, but those who look upon operative surgeiy as a mere handicraft, forget that the skilful wielding of instruments alone is not all that is necessary in one who wishes to be a good operator, in the true sense of the word. Far from this, he must not only make himself thoroughly acquainted with the principles and practice of ordi- nary surgery, if I may so speak, but with this knowledge he must be possessed of certain endoAvments and characteristics, which are more the gifts of nature than the results of his own seeking; much indeed may be acquired by practice, but tlie quick eye, the cool temper, and the imperturbable presence of mind, are truly gifts of nature, and if to these qualifications are added a sound knowledge of anatomy, and a ready appreciation

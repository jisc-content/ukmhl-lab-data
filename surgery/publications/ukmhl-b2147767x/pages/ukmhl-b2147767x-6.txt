8 of other powerful lowering remedies was employed to a great extent, and the fact that the resources of nature were required in order that the various processes connected with inflamma- tion should be carried out with safety to the patient, was lost sight of. Of late years, however, pathology has taught.us that in by far the greater number of cases of inflammatory diseases andinjmies, some morbid condition of the blood is working as the direct or indirect cause of the manifestations observed, and that the ab- straction of the diseased fluid, or the violent lowering of the nervous and vascular energies, by active medicines is danger- ous and unscientific treatment. The surgeon, when called to a case of inflammatory disease, does not content himself with studying and combating the local manifestation alone, he looks further, and endeavours to ascertain what is the precise nature of the cause producing it, and if he finds this out, as he gene- rally will, his line of practice will be more scientific, and will tend to greater success, than if he were led by a mere empi- I'icisra, or looked alone to sj^mptoms. It is impossible to overlook the great improvement connected with the local treatment of inflamed and ulcerated parts. Sim- plicity indeed, is now the order of the day in the application of surgical remedies, instead of the complicated dressings which were formerly used to such diseased parts, the clean, simple, and effectual water di'essing is now employed by most surgeons; and although this fact may appear to be almost too insignificant to mention here, the improvement is a great one, and we are especially indebted to the late Mr. Liston for having so strongly advocated this simple appliance. Not only is inflammation, with its consequences, much better understood and more correctly treated than it was a few years ago, but a more extended knowledge of its pathology, and of the conditions and circumstances under which various attacks of inflammation arise, has led to the prevention of it in a gi'eat degree. The records of surgery, both at home and abroad, have shown that a very considerable number of those who were brought together in hospitals, as sufferers from injuries or ope- rations, became attacked by inflannnation, erysipelatous, or gangrenous; it was ascertained, after diligent investigation, that this unfortunate result was caused by overcrowding, and by an insufficient attention to ventilation and cleanliness.

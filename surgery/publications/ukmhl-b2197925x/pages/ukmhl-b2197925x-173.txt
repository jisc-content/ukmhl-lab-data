143 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. piece of hard iron or steel with a flat end, made rough in rectangular lines like a file. By placing the rough end of the cone upon the foreign body at the bottom of the wound and rotating the olive-shaped handle between the finger and thumb, particles of the metallic or other body can be rasped off, and retained in the grooves of the file-like end, and thus brought out for examination. Extraction of halls and foreign bodies.—It is of the greatest im- portance for the future well-doing of the patient, that any ball or foreign particles which may have lodged should be removed by the surgeon. A most careful examination of the parts is always neces- sary. This should be made as soon after the injury as possible, before swelling and oedema of the tissues have come on. If the ball has tra- versed some distance, and it cannot be detected near the surface, a silver probe of about tweh^e inches in length is most useful, and will allow an exploration to be made along the track of the bullet. As a rule, however, the best examination is made with the finger passed t into the wound, which may be enlarged if required. When the ball is deeply lodged, a bullet forceps will be found of great service. Excellent instruments are devised by Coxeter, Savigny, and others. When it is near the surface, a pair of straight incisor-tooth forceps will seize fast * Forceps for extracting bullets.—Weiss. f Pocket spoon and drill forceps for extracting bullets.

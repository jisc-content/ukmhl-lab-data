DISEASES OF THE 290 swelling occurring very soon after the pain ; redness and tenderness of the skin; and fever, which is often violent and alarming. The swelling is peculiar, and is distinctive of the disease. It is occasioned hy a rapid effusion of fluid into the synovial cavity; and, consequently, if the joint is superficial, it fluctuates freely. It is always most prominent at the points where the joint is least covered by ligament, and, consequently, the shape of the joint is always altered. When the knee is affected, the patella is protruded forwards, and theie is a great fulness at each side of it, and at the lower and front part of the thigh. In the elbow, the swelling is most distinct above and. between the olecranon and the condyle, and in the hip and shoulder there is a general fulness of the surrounding parts. Prognosis.—This disease is much more serious when it affects one joint solely, and more particularly when it arises from local injury (especially a penetrating wound), than when it affects many joints, and arises from constitutional disorder. The danger to life in any case will be proportionate to the severity of the febrile symptoms, and the rapidity and sharpness of the pulse ; delirium, or typhoid symptoms, show great peril. Morbid Anatomy.—In slight cases the synovial membrane is red- dened, and the joint contains a quantity of turbid serum. In very severe cases, the membrane suppurates rapidly, and the cartilage entirely ul- * Sketch of a patient affected with acute synovitis of the right knee.

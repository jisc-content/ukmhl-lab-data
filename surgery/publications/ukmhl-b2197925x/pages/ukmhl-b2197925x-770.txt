SLINGS AND BANDAGING. 736 neatly without pins or stitches, by merely splitting up the end of the bandage into two tails, which may be turned opposite ways round the finger, and be tied in a bow. This is a convenient way of keeping dressings on the penis, unless sticking-plaster is used, which is better. VI. For the Hand.—A bandage about two inches wide may be passed in a figure of 8 round the hand and wrist, excluding the thumb, and may be finished by one or two circular turns round the wrist. VII. For the Fore-arm.—After applying it about the hand and wrist as just described, carry it up the fore-arm, and in every turn fold or reverse the bandage sharply and smoothly back upon itself, in such a way that it may lie on the limb without creases. VIII. For the Foot.—Let the roller be first passed round the metatarsus, and then be carried up round the ankle, and back again round the foot exactly as depicted at p. 72. The bandage should always be brought up on the inner side of the instep, as there shown, in order to support the arch of the foot. Sometimes it is necessary to cover the heel entirely with the bandage. This can only be neatly accomplished

INGUINAL HERNIA. 5GT behind the external ring. Its coverings are the same as those of the oblique variety, except the fascia propria and cremasteric fascia, for it has no connection with the cord. The epigastric artery runs external Fig. 4* to the neck of the sac. This hernia may, however, separate or burst through tiie conjoined tendons before it. In a few rare cases it has been found to protrude outside the border of the conjoined tendon and to be covered by a few cremasteric fibres. The spermatic cord gene- rally lies on its outer side. (Figs. 5 and 8, left side.) 3. The congenital hernia is a variety of the oblique, and is so called because the state of parts which permits of it exists only at or soon after birth. A portion of omentum or intestine accompanies the testicle in its descent, and passes down with it into the very pouch of perito- naeum which forms the timica vaginalis reflexa, before its communica- tion with the general peritonseal cavity has become obliterated. The sac of this hernia is consequently formed by the tunica vaginalis; its coverings in other respects are the same as those of the oblique variety, and the protruded bowel lies in immediate contact with the testicle, and if not replaced generally adheres to it. (Fig. 6.) 4. The encysted (or hernia infantilis) is a sub-variety of the conge- nital. The protruding bowel pushes before it a sac of peritonaeum either into or close behind the tunica vaginalis, and this tunic and the sac adhere very closely together. This hernia, therefore, has, as it * Figure 4, quoted from Med. Times, 1864, vol. 1., p. 220, shows the parts of inguinal rupture seen from the front; b, shows the fibres of the internal oblique normally covering the deep ring and restraining protrusion.

236 MSEASES AND INJURIES OF THE BONES. 3. Cancer of the lymphatic glands is usually a secondary affection, as we have before described. More rarely they are the primary seat of the disease, which then is more frequently soft cancer than hard. The diagnosis at first may be difficult, especially between soft cancer com- mencing in young subjects, and any other form of enlargement. But the rapid progress of the soft cancer, and the failure of health, which is sure to ensue after a certain time, will be leading distinctions. CHAPTER Y. DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE BONES. SECTION I.—DISEASES DEPENDING ON HYPERTROPHY. I. Microscopical Characters of Diseased Bone.—When a thin transverse section of diseased bone is examined under a good microscope, the observer readily distinguishes some large round or oval apertures— sections of the Haversian canals which convey the blood-vessels. Around these the bone—an obscurely-granular substance—appears to be arranged in concentric laminEE, containing amidst the laminae the bone cells, with the canaliculi or minute pores projecting from them. Larger vacuities in the bone, visible to the naked eye, contain the maiTOw and veins. Now it appears, from the researches of Mr. Tomes and of Mr. Campbell De Morgan, that bone during life is in a state of constant absorption and renewal. Fresh Haversian canals are being incessantly tunnelled out in the solid bone, and older ones are filled up. This is evident from

OPERATIONS FOR TYING ARTERIES. 752 wards. Now the operator must carefully identify the artery by its pulsation, or by the appearance of its coats; but it may not pulsate unless the muscles of the limb are relaxed. The needle must be passed in whatever direction the operator finds most convenient for avoiding the veins. Should a large branch be exposed, the trunk must be tied above and not below it. bhould two large arteries be found running parallel, it must be ascertained by pressure which of them communicates with the aneurysmal sac, or the wound, and that one tied ; but if no effect be produced, except both be compressed, then both must be secured. Should it happen when only one vessel is ap- parent, that compression on it does not check bleeding or pulsation be- low, seaich must be made for a second one. When the ligature is applied very high, the proximity of the origin of the superior profunda artery must not be forgotten. To tie the Brachial Artery in the middle of the arm, the incision should be along the inner side of the biceps. The basilic vein will probably be found passing from its superficial to its deeper course. The median nerve will, if regular, be seen lying over the vessel, and should be drawn either outwards or inwards, and the biceps be well relaxed. The ope- rator should be on his guard not to mistake the inferior profunda artery and the ulnar nerve, for the brachial and the median nerve, an error liable to be made if the profunda has be- come enlarged, and best avoided by dissecting towards the biceps, or rather towards the centre of the limb, and not getting too far inter- nally. The middle third of the artery should be tied, when such an operation is required for hasmorrhage from the hand, or from the inter- osseous vessels. To tie the Brachial Artery in its lou-er third. â€” This operation has been most frequently done for aneurysm, produced by careless vene- section, and there can be no doubt that in the large majority of small

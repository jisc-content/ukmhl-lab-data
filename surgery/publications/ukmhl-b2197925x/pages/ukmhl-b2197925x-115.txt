And this coagulation extends some distance from the mortified part, so that a limb has been amputated in the thigh for mortification of the leg without the loss of any blood from the femoral artery. Sometimes, however, as in hospital gangrene, these processes of adhesion ai-e deficient, and the blood is found fluid in the vessels, so that the separation of the slough is attended with severe hemorrhage. Constituiioml Symptoms.—The constitutional symptoms of mortifi- cation (that is to say, making a distinction between mortification and any disease v/hich may have gone before and led to it) are those of depression. If it be very extensive—if the adjacent parts be unhealthy, with no disposition to form the line of demarcation, but, on the con- trary, with a greater tendency to serous effusion, or diffuse inflamma- tion—or if the mortified part be of great importance, as intestine or lung, the constitutional symptoms will be of a low typhoid cast; there will be great anxiety, hiccough, a jaundiced skin, a soft, or i-apid thready, and jerking pulse, and frequently profuse perspiration of a cadaverous odour. This indicates the fact that mortification introduces a new element of danger :—to wit, the absorption of putrid liquids from the mortified part. Diagnosis.—It is important not to mistake the lividityand vesica- tions of bruises, especially when they accompany fractures, for gan- * From a cast in the King's College Museum.

DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS. 012 there for an hour or two at a time. This is often called the cure by vital dilatation.^ The plaster bougie, if used, must be slightly bent, and oiled. If its passage is resisted, gentle pressure may be tried, to see if it will enter the stricture. If it seem to pass, the operator should let go for a moment to see if it recoil; for it must be remarked that it may bend against the stricture without entering it, and may thus lacerate the canal. If there is more than one stricture, a metallic sound with a bulbous point may be of use, because it will not be grasped by the fii'st stric- ture after the bulb has passed. 2. Urethra Dilators.â€”The good effects of the bougie are owing to the stimulus of gentle pressure. But, in order to accelerate the cure, various plans have been proposed for effecting dilatation, with or with- out actual laceration of the stricture. First may be mentioned the compound circular catheter, used by Dr. Andrew Buchanan of Glasgow, 1831, and described in the Med. Gaz. for March 1841. It consists of three or more graduated silver tubes sliding one over the other, and the smallest sliding over a round-pointed probe. The external tubes acting as guides enable the inner ones readily to pass the strictured part, and when once a smaller tube has passed, it is safe and easy to slide in the others. In guiding this instrument along the membranous and prostatic portion, Dr. Buchanan retains his finger in the rectum. {See Figure A.)

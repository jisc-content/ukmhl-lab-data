DISEASE OF THE HIP-JOINT. 306 duration of the disease may vary from two or three months to sevei'al years. Diagnosis.—From psoas abscess it may be distinguished by the absence of pain in the back, and of tenderness on pressui e in the iliac and lumbar regions. Psoas abscess also points on the outside of tlie femoral vessels below Poupart's ligament. From chronic rheuraatic arthritis, by the history of the case, the age of the patient, the irregular hardness caused by ossified growths around the joints, the absence of audible crepitation, and by the pain caused by pressing the articular surfaces against each other; which is not a character of the chronic rheumatic affection. Yet it must be remembered that this latter disease may lead to abscess if the patient meets with injury. The great pain caused by pressing the femur against the acetabulum will distinguish this disease from sciatica. Treatment.—This must of course be the same in principle as the treatment of other diseased joints. If the patient comes under treat- ment in the earliest stage, the limb should be maintained at perfect rest in the straight posture, by means of a straight splint reaching from the axilla to the foot, or by sandbags. If distortion has already com- menced, a bandage of leather or pasteboard should be applied ; and the patient should not be permitted to lie constantly on the sound side, else the distortion of the spine and the chance of dislocation will be en- hanced.

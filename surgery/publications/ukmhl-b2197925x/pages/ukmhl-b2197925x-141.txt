EPITHELIOMA. Ill is the true skin, thickened into a tough brawny mass, (composed of a fibrous basis interspersed with numerous spots and streaks of opaque yellow, or brown. 4. If the subcutaneous tissues are involved, they present the same character. Microscopical examination shows, 1. The epidermic layer to be com- posed of epithelium, arranged in concentric layers around and between the papilla. 2. The papillae and dermis are composed of white, inter- mingled with yellow fibrous tissue, everywhere abundantly infiltrated with epithelium cells, and with theu' nuclei and fibro-plastic matter. In the papillae the epithe- lium is seen to be arranged ' --^^jj,^ symmetrically in concentric - l i_ t'^^'j-^ layers amongst the scanty - ", r fibrous elements; and this ^ ^o-^v ^ ) arrangement may pene- _ ^ \*ff *^ trate to some depth within ^ -^^^ ' ^—-^ ^ ^ v ; the cutis, from which ~ , - • elongated and imbricated —' rolls of epithelium, some- what resembling the heads of young asparagus, can be extricated. 3. Within the cutis and subjacent tissue, the epithelium is found some- times in concentric pellets, like the comedones or grubs, or inspissated contents of sebaceous follicles; sometimes in rings formed within obstructed ducts or follicles, but usually in large irregular quantities infiltrated amongst the fibres of the cutis and of the subcutaneous areolar tissue. The epithelial cells vary much in f size, although their nuclei do not; \^.._^^";'^\ they may be round, elongated, or ^^^^^ ^ / ^ spurred, wrinkled, split into fibres ; they may be infiltrated with oil- globules ; dried up ; or softened into an almost amorphous granular mass mixed with oil and cholesterine, which to the naked eye resembles tubercle. Generally speaking, the larger the cell, the less perfect the nucleus. Some cells have double nuclei, or some nuclei double nucleoli, but not often. Epithelial tumours usually exude from a cut surface a copious, clear, serous juice, in which may be observed floating masses of epithelium cells, nuclei, and, perhaps, oil-globules and cholesterine. The diagnosis of this disease from cancer is spoken of in the last section. * A representation of a papilla, or the apex of a granulation, found in the urine, in the case of epithelioma of the bladder. Internally it contained a loop of vessels; outwardly it was clothed with scales of exuberant epithelium. About 200 diameters. t Epithelial cells infiltrating the deep tissues of the lip, near a so-called canczr of the lip.

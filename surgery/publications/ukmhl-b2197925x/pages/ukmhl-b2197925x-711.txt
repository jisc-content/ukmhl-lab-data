VESICO-VAGINAL FISTULA. 677 moted. When the spontaneous processes of cure are carried so far as can be, art must step in. The application of a cautery at a black heat to the edges of the fissure, at intervals of from ten to thirty days, so as to get them not to slough, but to contract, is much used, and with very excellent results, by Dr. Arthur Farre, both in the vesico- and recto-vaginal fistula and in lacerations of the perinaBum ; and the writer has seen it used with excellent effect in a case of recto-vaginal fistula by Dr. Tanner. But in most of such cases an operation should be performed as follows: â€”The patient, gently chloroformed, must be comfortably supported, leaning forward on her knees, with the chest at a lower level than the * abdomen. When a woman who has borne children, with a largish belly and somewhat relaxed, is placed in this position, and when the orifice of the vagina is dilated with the fingers, or with a single- bladed speculum, resembling a spoon with the edges rounded off, the downward pressure of the abdominal viscera will expand the vagina, air will enter audibly, and a good view will be obtained of the whole * Vesico-vaginal fistula.

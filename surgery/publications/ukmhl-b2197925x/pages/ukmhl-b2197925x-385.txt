355 the ends of the thread are each passed through the loop of its own side, drawn tightly through the punctures, and tied in a loop knot or bunch Fig. 1. Fig. 2. so that they can be unloosed and retightened as the tissues shrink and ulcerate under the pressure. In four or five days, the strangulated parts are sloughy and more or less separated. If not the ligature must be tightened upon them. As the wound fills by granulations, these must be carefully watched, and any tendency to njevous growth (marked by a deeper redness than the healthy granulations) must be restrained by the application of strong nitric acid, laid on with a feather, the parts being afterwards well oiled. Another method, practised by Mr. Wood in cases where it is desirable to save the skin and prevent a scar, as in subcutaneous nsevi of the face, neck, hands, and arms, is done as follows:â€”The same needle is used as in the operation last described. Armed with a stout, hempen, well-soaped ligature thread, it is first passed under the skin round half the circumference of the morbid tissue, entering and emerg- ing at the opposite poles of the tumour. The short end of the thread is left in the puncture, and the needle withdrawn, carrying the long end. Next, it is passed under the base of the tumour across its diameter, entering and emerging at the punctures first made. The loop at the eye of the needle is then caught, and held while the needle is with- drawn, carrying the free end of the thread. Lastly, the needle is passed round the remaining half of the circumference, under the skin, through the same two punctures, and the ligature thread detached. There are now a loop and two free ends emerging from the further

PERMANENT STRICTURE. 617 with extravasation of urine, and in cases of stricture complicated with abscesses or false passage when no instrument can be passed ; and it is expedient in cases of very old stricture with extensive urinary fistulae, when the health is giving way, and other means fail of afford- ing relief. It is performed thus: â€”the patient is placed in the lithotomy position ; a grooved staff' is passed through the stricture if possible. If this be not possible, it must be passed down to it. The left forefinger, introduced into the rectum, is to feel for the staff in the urethra, and serve as a guide to the incisions. Then a straight bistoury is to be plunged in just above the anus to the depth of an inch, with its edge upwards, and made to cut its way out upwards in the middle line of the peri- nseum. The end of the sound should next be felt for and cut upon, and the knife is then to be carried backwards through the stricture into the urethra beyond it, which is always more or less dilated and prominent, especially if the patient is told to strain and try to pass urine. The stricture should be thoroughly divided, and all sinuses laid open. A catheter should then be passed into the bladder, and be retained there for twenty-four or forty-eight hours. If the operator desires merely to relieve the bladder, and does not think it prudent, from the pa- tient's condition, to make the more extensive incisions through the stricture which we have just de- scribed, he may, after the first in- cision, keeping the back of the knife to the rectum, cut into the mem- branous part of the urethra behind the stricture, and so get a female catheter into the bladder, reserving the stricture for future ti-eatment.

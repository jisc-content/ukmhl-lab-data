OBTUKATOR HERNIA. 586 are the ordinary seats of hernia. It may be a consequence of wounds or bruises. Its treatment requires no distinct observations ; but if it should ever be necessary to operate for the relief of strangulation, care must be taken to avoid the epigastric artery.* III. Perineal Hernia descends between the bladder and rectum, forcing its way through the pelvic fascia and levator ani, and forming a tumour in the perinseum. IV. Vaginal Hernia is a variety of the preceding, in which the tumour projects into and blocks up the vagina, instead of descending to the perinseum. V. Labial or Pudendal Hernia, another variety, descends be- tween the vagina and ramus of the ischium, and forms a tumour in one of the labia. It is to be distinguished from an inguinal hernia which has descended into the labium, by the absence of swelling at the abdominal rings. These three hernia must be replaced by pressure with the fingers, and be kept up by pads made to bear against the perinseum, and perhaps by hollow caoutchouc pessaries worn in the vagina.

In a fatal case related by Mr. Howship, in which a very small piece of * Mention is made in the Lend. Med. Gaz., 21sfc Oct., 1842, of an adipose tumour, situated between the peritoueeum and abdominal muscles, and project- ing through an aperture in the linea alba, through which it could be pushed back, so that it completely simulated a hernia. Such a case, if complicated with peritonitis, might render the diagnosis very obscure; but an incision would clear up the mystery. t From a preparation of Mr. Fergusson's in the King's College Museum.

116 CANCEH. contained in the meshes of a most delicate fibrous tissue. It is, as its name implies, of about the consistence of brain, or of very firm blanc- mange. When cut, it is seen to be of a whitish-yellow colour, or pink- ish, if vascular; on pressure there exudes from the cut surface a plentiful ymce, containing abundance of cancer cells, or nuclei. In external characters the soft cancer usually forms a tumour of rapid growth, rounded, smooth, more or less lobulated, softer in some places than in others, not tender. In its earlier stages it may be circumscribed and separable, though it may extend long distances in the interstices of muscles or other organs; in its latter it is usually adherent, blended with surrounding parts, and not moveable. If situated near the sur- face, it may, by the rapidity of its increase, cause the skin to ulcerate ; then, relieved from pressure, it grows with greater rapidity, throwing up huge fungous masses, from whose surface there oozes a thin sanious fluid. This, however, is not peculiar to soft cancers, but common to any other rapidly-increasing growth. 2. The hard cancer, or scirrhus, or carcinoma, has, as its name im- plies, a much firmer consistence than the preceding variety, which is due to the presence of a dense fibrous tissue; but there may be every gradation, in this respect, from a scirrhus as hard as fibro-cartilage to the softest and almost diffluent encephaloma. In well-marked examples, a hard cancer cuts crisply ; the cut surface shows irregular intersect- ing, firm, whitish fibrous bands, with a softer grayish or yellow matter in the interstices, from which the cancerous juice can be made to exude by pressure. In outward character it presents itself as a firm, hard, * Soft Cancer of the Breast, in the state known as fuvgus hematodes. From the King's College Museum.

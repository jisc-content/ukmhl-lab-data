In surgery, as in all other arts, tho;ie means are best which act directly; and there is no doubt but that the best instrument for treat- ing fractured patella is M. Malgaigne's hooks, here depicted. Two of the hooks are fixed into the tendon at the upper edge of the bone, and two into the lower, and they can be brought and kept in apposition by the screw. They cannot penetrate the bone, nor wound the joint. They may be kept in. six weeks, to insure bony union. Malgaigne had treated (1853) about eleven patients, producing bony union, and no bad results.* Thirdhi, inflammation must be sedulously prevented if possible. If it comes on, it must be removed by leeches, cold lotions, or warm ibmentations, and purgatives ; and no constrict- ing apparatus should be applied during this condition. In such a case as that depicted and described at p. 283, it has been proposed to scrape off the aponeurotic membrane which adheres to the broken surfaces, by subcutaneous section, and then to apply the hooks. 2. Fracture by direct violence is generally comminuted; perhaps longitudinal. There is * See a very able paper in Med. Times and Gazette for 1864, vol. 1. p. 86, by Mr. Pyle, of the Middlesex Hospital, for a series of eight cases treated by the hooks and eight by the old method. The superiority of results is remarkable, and not less so the less amount of irksomeness and shorter time of cure. The author believes from results which he has seen that fractured patella is one of the oppi'obria of English surgery.

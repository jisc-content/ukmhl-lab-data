AMPUTATIONS OF THE FOOT. 790 II. Amputation op all the toes at their metatarsal JOINTS—an operation which may be requisite in cases of frost-bite— is performed by first making a transverse incision along the dorsal aspect of the metatarsal bones, dividing the tendons and lateral liga- ments of each joint in succession ; and then, the phalanges being dislo- cated upwards, the knife is placed beneath their metatarsal extremities, and made to cut out a flap from the skin on the plantar surface, sufficient to cover the heads of the metatarsal bones. III. Amputation op the metatarsal bone of the great TOE is performed precisely like the operation for the removal of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. An incision down to the bone with a scalpel, is carried along its dorsum and round the root of the great toe, as shown in Fig. 1, Secondly, the knife, which must be kept as close to the bone as possible, is made to dissect it out from the sur- rounding parts ; thirdly, the bone is cut through with forceps, a part of the operation shown in Fig. 2. Vessels are to be tied, and the wound the tarsus, before performing amputation. For example, he had a case in which the head of the metatarsal bone of the great toe was suspected to be carious, and was condemned to be cut out; a serious operation, inasmuch as it takes away one of the three supports of the arch of the foot. But a free incision revealed disease in the fi.vst jjhalanx only. This was removed, and the patient recovered with the slightest possible limp.

DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP. 319 the head of the bone is thrown on the dorsum ilii. 2nd]y. The dis- location backwards on the sciatic notch; ordly, downwards, on the obturator externus muscle ; and 4thly, forwards, on the os pubis. Be- sides which there are two or three others that are exceedingly rare. t 1. Dislocation upvjards on the dorsum ilii is the most frequent. Symptoms.—The limb is from an inch and a half to two inches and a half shorter than the other; the toe rests on the opposite instep ; the knee is turned inwards, and is a little advanced upon the other; the limb can be slightly bent across the other, but cannot be bent out- wards ; the trochanter is less prominent than the other, and nearer the spine of the ilium ; and if the patient is thin, and there is no swelling, the head of the bone can be felt in its new situation. Diagnosis.—Fracture of the cervix femoris may be distinguished from this dislocation by the circumstance that the limb can be freely moved in any direction, although with some pain ; that it is turned out- wards instead of inwards ; and that it can be drawn to its proper length by moderate extension^ with some crepitus, but becomes shortened again as soon as the extension is discontinued: whereas in dislocation, it requires a forcible extension to restore the limb to its proper length * Dislocation upwards of the Hip-Joint.

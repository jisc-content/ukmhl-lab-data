OSSEOUS TUMOUR. 107 Cartilaginous tumoui'S are more frequent in early life. They are often multiple and hereditary; and although, as a general rule, they do not return when thoroughly excised, yet to this rule there are many exceptions. A case is narrated by Mr. Paget, in which a cartilaginous growth extended along the lym- phatics from the testicle to the vena cava inferior, and into the cavity of that vein.; masses of car- tilage were also found in the lungs.f II. Osseous Tumours are so con- stantly found in connection with the bones, that it will save repe- tition if we refer our readers for an account of them to the Chapter on the Bones. But we must say here, 1, that a distinction is to be drawn between tumours containing true bone-tissue, and others which are merely calcified or impreg- nated with amorphous earthy salts. 2. That some osseous tumours are foi'med by the hypertrophy of ex- isting bones ; and 3, others by the ossification of pre-existing fibrous, fibro-plastic, or cartilaginous tu- mours. When these are attached to the bones, they constitute exostoses; but true bony tumours, formed by the ossification of the other kinds, may exist isolated in the soft parts. The term osteosarcoma was for- merly used to signify any tumour in which bone was mingled with softer tissue ; as, for example, the enchrondroma, or fibrous tumour, when ossifying, and cancerous growths, springing from the sur- face of bone. SECTION V.â€”GLANDULAR AND VASCULAR TUMOURS. I. Glandular Tumours ai-e formed by the development of a tissue resembling that of secreting glands. Such tumours ai e most common in the female breast, where they are known by the terms chronic main- mar y tumour, and imperfect glandular hypertrophy; but they may * Bony skeleton of enchondroma. t .Aliiiler on Cancer, kc, translated by West, Lend, 1840 ; Lebert, Pbys.

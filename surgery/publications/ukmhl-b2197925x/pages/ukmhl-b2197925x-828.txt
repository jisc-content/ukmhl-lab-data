AMPUTATION AT THE ANKLE-JOINT. 794 lateral ligaments divided. The os calcis is then dissected out, in which process, which is not easy, the knife should be kept close to the bone, so as not to wound the plantar artei'ies if possible. The malleoli are cut 2. off smoothly, and if there is any disease of the ankle-joint, a thin layer of the end of the tibia should be removed; the posterior flap is then brought forward and retained by suture. The skin of the heel is rather Jiable to slough, and hence many surgeons make the incision more oblique, so as to preserve more skin from the dorsum of the foot, and less from the sole. II. PiRiGOFFS AMPUTATION is theoretically more perfect than Syme's, inasmuch as it is easier to perform, leaving a longer stump, better adapted to bear pressure; and does not disturb the tendo Achillis, nor, generally speaking, cause so much injuryâ€”nor is there the hollow flap. Instead of dissecting out the entire os calcis, this sur- geon removes the anterior part of the bone, which supports the astra- galus, and leaves the heel process, which forms a rounded, callous, and natural termination to the stump, and fits better into the heel of a shoe for the support of the body. M. Pivigoff began his first incision* close in front of the outer mal- leolus, and carried it straight down to, and transversely across the sole of the foot, then obliquely upwards and forwards to the front of the inner malleolus. It divides everything down to the bone; and the inci- sion is brought obliquely forwards on the inner side, in order not to cut the posterior tibial aitery before its division into its plantar * See a very good account of this operation by Mr. Spencer Wells, Med. Times, 20th March, 1858.

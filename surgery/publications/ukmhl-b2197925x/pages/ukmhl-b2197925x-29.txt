THE SURGEON'S VADE MECUM. PAET I. ON SOME AFFECTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH MAY ACCOMPANY LOCAL DISEASE OR INJURY. CHAPTER I. PROSTRATION, OR COLLAPSE. Certain affections of the nervous system may be caused by, or may accompany, or follow, or complicate, various diseases and injuries. But when we speak of affections of the nervous system, we do not speak of anything immaterial or psychical; for every pain, every dis- order of motion, or of thaught, depends, without doubt (so far as sur- gery is concerned), upon physical conditions, although we are not at present able to state what such conditions may be.

If the symptoms are analysed, they will be found to be com- pounded, 1st. Of the effects of depression of the heart's action ; includ- ing the symptoms commonly known by the term syncope; and 2nd.

Thus, sometimes depression of the vascular system predominates, and the patient lies in a state of per- fect syncope, with the pulse and respiration imperceptible. Sometimes the nervous system is chiefly affected, the patient being insensible, even though the heart's action is restored; or bewildered and incoherent, as though intoxicated; or even comatose, as though he had taken a nar- D B

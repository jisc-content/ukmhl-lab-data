DISLOCATION OF THE ELBOW. 316 to injury of the circumflex nerve. Violent spasms and neuralgic pains of the arm sometimes occur from injury to the other nerves.* IV. Dislocation of the Elbow presents six varieties. Botk radius and ulna may be dislocated, 1, simply backwards; or, 2, back- wards and outwards ; or, 3, backwards and inwards. 4. The ulna by itself may be dislocated backwards; and the radius by itself either, 5, backwards; or 6, forwards. 1. When both radius and ulna are dislocated backwards, the elbow is bent at a right angle, and is immoveable. The olecranon projects much behind ; a hollow can be felt at each side of it, corresponding to the great sigmoid cavity ; and the trochlea of the humerus forms a hard protuberance in front. The coronoid pi'ocess rests in that fossa of the humerus which naturally contains the olecranon. 2. In dislocation of both bones backwards and outwards, the coronoid process is thrown behind the external condyle; and in addition to the preceding symptoms, the head of the radius can be very plainly felt on the outer side of the joint. 3. The dislocation backwards and inwards is known by a great pro- jection of the outer condyle, in addition to the symptoms of the first variety. 4. In dislocation backwards of the ulna solely, the olecranon is much projected backwards, the elbow is immoveably bent at right angles, and the forearm is much twisted and pronated. The treatment of these four varieties is the same. Reduction may be ejected, first, by fixing the lower end of the humerus whilst the forearm is drawn forwards; or, secondly, the surgeon may bend the elbow forcibly over his knee; or, thirdly (if the case be quite recent), he may forcibly straighten the arm, so as to make the tendon of the biceps pull the trochlea of the humerus back into its place. * See Stanley on Rupture of the Biceps Tendon, Lend.

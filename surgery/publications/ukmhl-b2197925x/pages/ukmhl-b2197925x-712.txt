Too much care cannot be taken in this respect. Then sutures are to be passed either by means of a needle with a fish-hook curve, which the writer devised for the purpose, first through the farther, then through the nearer edge ; the needle being so curved that it can be introduced and withdrawn without wounding the vagina, and so that the operator's hand does not get in the way of his eyes. When a sufficient number have been parsed, their ends may be passed through a bar of white metal, drilled with holes ; one bar on the farther the other on the nearer side of the fissure, so as to act as quill sutures: the ends of the wires to be secured by split shot, pushed on the wires close up to the bar, then pinched by forceps to make them bite the wires. This is Dr. Marion Sims's plan. A better needle, however, is the hollow one represented here, de- * This fact has long been applied by the author in practice; and has been prominently stated by iJr. Marion Sims in his Clinical Kemarks on Uterine Surgery, Lancet, 1864, vol. ii.

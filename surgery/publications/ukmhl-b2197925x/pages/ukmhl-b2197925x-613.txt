STRANGULATED INGUINAL HERNIA. 579 cessive coverings, before enumerated, are usually divided in the fol- lowing mannerl—a little bit of each is pinched up with forceps, and Fig. 16. I'ig- 1^- cut into with the knife held horizontally; a director is passed into this little aperture, and the layer is then divided on it to the extent of the incision in the skin. Cautious operators will find (or make) many more layers than those usually enumerated, which are, in fact, easily subdivisible, especially in old hernise. But the practised surgeon, who knows that he is operating on the living body, and that his object is to cut through everything till he reaches the sac, will dispense with these dissecting-room tbrmalities. When at last the sac is reached, which will be linown by its bluish transparency, it is to be opened sufficiently to admit the finger, a little bit of it being first pinched up and cut through, so as to admit the director. Then the left forefinger should be passed up into the neck of the sac to seek for the stricture, which will generally be at the internal ring. It is usually at tlie deep ring, but may be at the external ring (or at both); but wherever it is, it must be dilated so as to allow the finger to pass into the abdomen, A curved blunt-pointed bistoury or hernia-knife—not cutting quite up to the point—should be passed up flat on the finger through the stricture, and its edge be then turned up so as to divide it; and in every case the division should be made directly upwards, parallel to the linea alba; and then whether the hernia be direct or oblique, the epigastric artery will not be wounded. If no strigture be discovered in the neclj, it must be sought for in the body of the sac.

625 ENLARGED PROSTATE. ture, and incidentally of the glandular. " In youth," says Mr. Thomp- son, " the organ becomes enlarged by interstitial plastic effusion^ the result of inflammatory action. In age there is an unnatural develop- ment of the prostatic tissue itself." The increase may be but slightly above the ordinary chesnut size of the gland, or it may render it as large as a man's fist, or larger. It may aifect the whole organ, especially the lateral lobes, pretty uni- formly ; in which case the pi'ostatic portion of the urethra is greatly lengthened ; or it niay affect one side more than the other, in which case the canal will be twisted; or it may affect the posterior median portion, which lies between the ejaculatory ducts, enlarging it into what is commonly called the middle or third lobe; a lobe which, ac- cording to Mr. Thompson, is purely the result of unnatural enlarge- ment and does not exist in health. The consequence of this is, that there is a projection at the very orifice of the urethra, causing a most serious impediment to the issue of the urine. The prostatic portion of the urethra, besides being lengthened, twisted, and obstructed, may be very much narrowed ; or, on the contrary, may be expanded into a sort of pouch, which may communicate with cavities formed by the dilated ducts of the gland, and contain calculous matter. Hypertrophy and derangement of the muscular tibres at and near the trigone, may pro- duce a ti-ansverse bar at the neck of the bladder. * Enlarged prostate, f Cyst of the prostate from the King's College Collection.

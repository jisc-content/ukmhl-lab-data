512 LARYNGOTOMY AND TRACHEOTOMY. above the isthmus of the thyroid gland, and immediately below the cricoid cartilage. The operator should feel for the cricoid cartilage, and ink a perpendicular line, a quarter of an inch long, in the middle line below it. The skin should be drawn up over the thyroid, and then be cut through in this line. Then the cricoid cartilage and first ring of the trachea being made out, the hook of the steel director is to be hooked in just below the cricoid, and made to hold the larynx well upwards and forwards. It will be seen that the groove of the director is open to the very end, and that on the opposite side to the groove the instrument finishes in a tenaculum hook. This hook then being fixed under the cricoid, and held up with the operator's left hand, a nari'ow stout scalpel is passed along the groove, with its edge downwards. " Should the thyroid isthmus," says Dr. Edwards, " or any pulsating vessel be in the way below, the puncture should barely admit the extre- mity of a probe-pointed bistoury;" in which case the bistoury being steadied against the end of the groove may be made to divide two or three rings of the trachea from within outwards in subcutaneous fashion; the soft parts over the trachea can be dilated enough after- wards to admit of the introduction of the tube. Of course if the sur- geon chooses to perform the operation below the thyroid gland, this instrument will be equally useful.* The instrument shown below was devised by Mr. H. Thomp- sonf at the request of Dr. Marshall Hall, who wished to find some method of opening the trachea most expeditiously and safely. It con- sists of two blades, united at one end by a hinge ; at the other bent downwards at an angle, and furnished with cutting edges, nicely * Charles Edwards, M.D., Lancet, 1853, vol. 1., p. 492. f Lancet, 1853, vol. i., p. 221.

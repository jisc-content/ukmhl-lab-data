EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOTNT. 806 let down by hinges, so as to give access to the wound: in other re- spects the cut explains itself.* Mr. Price, who with Mr. Parkinson and Mr. Heath, had great oppor- tunities ot perfecting the details of treatment in Mr. Fergusson's cases in the King's College Hospital, before he executed his own operations, used a Mclntyre's splint, of thin tinned iron, with a footboard. The length can be regulated. The portion corresponding to the popliteal space is slightly convex upwards, so as to keep the bones in their place: and is narrow, so that the wound can be got at. There is an inter- val between the leg plate and footboard, in order that nothing may press on the heel or tendo Achillis. The foot and leg are confined by rollers to this splint, previously v/ell padded with wool covered with oiled silk ; and with additional pads of the same, where needed, espe- cially behind the head of the tibia. A short splint should be laid on the front of the thigh, and compressed by a web and buckle. Then on the outside of this apparatus is used a long side splint, the central part of which is replaced by an iron hoop. It passes up the side, and is provided with a perineal band, as usual (p. 278). Lastly, the whole limb, so put up, may be swung in Salter's apparatus, as re- presented in the following drawing made from the life by Dr. West- macott, from a patient of Mr. Price's in the Great Northern Hospital. The wounded part is uncovered, and the side splint removed, and part of the swing undone to show it. The practical fact is, that the dress- ings had been duly attended to, that the limb had never been disturbed since the opei-ation, and was convalescent in the fifth week.

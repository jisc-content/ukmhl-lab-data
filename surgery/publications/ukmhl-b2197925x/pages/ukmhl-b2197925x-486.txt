The first consist of fleshy pedunculated growths, nearly colourless, having a thin cuticular covering, unattended with pain, not appearing as the result of inflammation, and not accompanied with discharge, and- usually attached to the middle glandular portion of the meatus. These are extremely rare. The others, which are very common, and which grow chiefly from the very bottom of the meatus, are consequences of inflammation, and are always attended with discharge. They are usually found of the size of a pea or bean, but may, of course, be much smaller, or may be so large as to project from the meatus. When small they are usually of a florid red colour. They consist of fibro- plastic cells, with more or less of perfectly-developed fibro-cellular tissue, and of almost structureless gelatinous substance. Cancer of the ear in an early stage may simulate polypus. Tt^eatment.—Polypi are generally symptomatic of other affections of the organ, especially of the deeper-seated parts, to the removal of which the surgeon's chief attention should be directed. When these affections im- prove, polypi will sometimes waste away, or become loose and fall out of the meatus. For the most part, however, they require special means for their cure. The instruments here figured are very effective in ex- tracting them ; and their return may be prevented (counter-irritation * Sir W. E. Wilde's snare for polypi; the father of the ecraseur.

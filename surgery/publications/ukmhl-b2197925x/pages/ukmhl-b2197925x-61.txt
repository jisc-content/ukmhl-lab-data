31 INFLAMMATION. means of introducing it into the blood. Thus the lungs and pleura, and other organs, largely supplied with lymphatics, introduce a large quantity of fibiine into the blood, when inflamed ; whereas the bi'ain, if inflamed, being poor in lymphatics, produces no hyperinosis. This state is usually attended with increase in the white corpuscles, which are products of the lymphatic glands and spleen. There are," says Vir- chow, " three different conditions bordering one upon the other—hype- rinosis, leucocytosis, and leuchsemia, between which and the lymphatic fluids there exists an intimate connection." Hyperinosis is to be re- ferred to the accidental condition of the organs from which the lymph- atic fluids are derived, whilst those states which depend on an increase in the cellular elements are rather regulated by the condition of the glands through which these fluids have flowed. Leucocytosis is an in- crease in the white cellular elements of the blood, depending on tempo- rary or transient conditions of certain organs: leuchsemia, a permanent increase depending on fixed conditions, usually fatal. Leucocytosis to a certain degree takes place after every meal, from the matters which pass through the mesenteric glands. In pregnancy there is constant leucocytosis and hyperinosis, and enlargement of lumbar glands;— hence the bulfy coat and the multitude of colourless cells in the blood, which have sometimes figured as evidence of puerperal pyaemia. In scrofulous enlargement of the lymphatic glands, the blood becomes loaded with white particles. So far Virchow. SECTION IV.—ANATOMY OF AN INFLAMED PART. An inflamed part has a large quantity of blood intruded into its vessels; and its tissues and their interstices are infiltrated with liquids which have exuded from, or have been attracted from those vessels. It is softer^ than a sound part, for the hardest tissues lose some of their cohesion. It is also redder, although mere redness, |;os^ mortem^ is no proof of inflammation, for it may be produced by congestion or by a straining of tissues with dissolved blood pigment which has oozed out of the vessels in incipient putrefaction. In its minutest analysis inflammation seems to begin with a kind of nutritive irritation,—an increased assumption of nutritive matter by the microscopic elements of the part, and a cloudy ^ appearance, owing partly to the imbibition of unusual ^ . nutriment, partly to the enlargement of the germinal matter contained. The next step consists in fissure, ^^^^ multiplication and division of the nuclear and cell ele- ments. Then comes hypersemia,—of the part if it have \ vessels ;—of the surrounding parts if it have none ; and ^^^^^ exudation, the appearance of liquor sanguinis, i.e. of serum and more or less fibrinous material, in the in- 1^^^^^^ terstices of the part if it have interstices, or else into the "^ #1^^^^^ neighbouring parts. Virchow divides inflammation ' -^il^^^^fl * Portion of muscle involved in inflammatory exudation; fatty degeneration of the muscle; and infiltration with fibro-plastic matter. From ^Tature.

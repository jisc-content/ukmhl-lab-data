798 EXCISION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. are denuded, softened, or necrosed, and they may be cut off with forceps or saw. Mr. Fergusson's Lion Forceps, p. 483, will be of great service in steadying the extremity of ,^ bone which is being removed. As much I as is necessary, and no more, of the bra- chialis must be cleared from the coronoid process. The lower end of the humerus is next dealt with ; if it requires to be cleai-ed from the soft parts in front, the knife must be kept close to the bone ; then as much as necessary, and no more, may be cut off. Arteries are now to be tied, and so soon as bleeding has ceased, the wound is to be brought together by su- tures, and the arm laid in a half-bent pos- ture, either on an angular splint, well padded and covered with oiled silk, to which it is to be properly secured by bandages; or Mr, Butcher's box, with moveable sides, may be used ; or Mr. Christopher Heath's splint, which secui-es, in the greatest per- fection, the advantages of entire rest; the power of keeping the limb of any desired length, by means of the screws; the power of bending it to any angle by means of the central hinge; and the convenience of dressing the wound without disturbance. The cut explains itself.* When the reparative stage has fairly set in, the joint should be moved from time to time to insure the formation of a flexible uniting medium or false joint. There are many varieties in the plan of the incisions and the after steps of the operation which will readily suggest themselves. For in- stance, the incision may be a perpendicular one six inches or so in length—which is theoretically the best—or may be like X or j—, or * See Mr. Heath's paper, Lancet, 28tli Nov., 1857.

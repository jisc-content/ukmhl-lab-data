589 SPASM OF THE SPHINCTER ANI, although the anus may be closed, there may be a fistulous track leading from the rectum just above it, and opening somewhere in the peri- nseum.* Treatment.â€”If the end of the intestine can be felt protruding when the child cries, a free crucial incision may be made into it without delay: if it cannot be felt, a day or two should be waited, so that it may become distended with meconium, and then a cautious incision should be made with a double-edged bistoury, in the direction of the curve of the sacrum. If it succeed in reaching the bowel, the aperture should be kept open by a bougie. But if this operation should fail in reaching the bowel, or if the rectum appear to be altogether deficient, the only resource is the for- mation of an artificial anus in the left loin (p. 550). When the rec- tum opens into the bladder or urethra, an aperture must be made into the neck of the bladder for the free dischai'ge of the faeces,J if the natural orifice cannot be restored. III. Spasm op the Sphincter Ani is known by violent pain of the anus, with difficulty of evacuating the fgeces. On examination, the muscle feels hard, and resists the introduction of the finger. This affection may be caused by constipation of the bowels, or disorder of the health. It may occur in sudden paroxysms which soon go off; or * Case in South's Chelius, vol. ii. p. 329. t Imperforate anus. From the King's Coll. IMuseum. X Case in Fergusson's Pract.

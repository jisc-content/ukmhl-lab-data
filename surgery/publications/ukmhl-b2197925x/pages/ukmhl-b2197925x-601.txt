Whereas hernia begins at the top of the scrotum ; it is not transparent; does not fluctuate ; does not prevent the testicle from being clearly felt, although it obscures the cord ; and dilates on coughing. But hernia may and does often coexist with hydrocele, the former beginning from above, the latter from below. Moreover, a hernia, consisting of intes- tine greatly distended with flatus, or a sac containing efi^used fluid, has been known to be as transparent as a hydrocele. 3.

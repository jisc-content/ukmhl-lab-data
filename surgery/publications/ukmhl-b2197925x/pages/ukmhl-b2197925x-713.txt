679 VESICO-VAGINAL FISTULA. scribed by Dr. Simpson, and said to have been deviseil by Mr. Startin, Other modes of securing the wire sutures, areâ€”the metallic button of Dr. Bozeman, a phite of lead adapted in size and curvature to tit the spot; and perforated with holes through which each pair of ligatures is drawn, and then fixed with split shot. This apparatus insures great fixity of the parts, and its use has been attended with great success. Instead of using a shot the wires may be twisted. Dr. Simpson has devised a wire splint, to hold the margins, or rather the whole site of the wound steadily, and to hold the sutures. It is made by twisting fifteen or twenty strands of fine iron thread into a cord ; the ends of which are plaited together in a circle, which may be moulded so as to surround the wound. A sufficient number of apertures is made with a common bcier, to allow the sutures to pass. The above figure shows it applied.* The annexed engravings repiesent needles adapted for wire sutures in these or any other operations. Mr. Price's has two holes, about half an inch apai t, and the upper and under surtaces grooved; wire " from hole below to that above ; end of wire doubled to hold it. Mr. Murray's has a groove and open box end. * Copied from Dr. Simpson's Lecture in Med. Times and Gaz , Jan. 81h, 185'J. Jlr.

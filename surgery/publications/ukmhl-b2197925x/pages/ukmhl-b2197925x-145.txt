CANCER. 115 there may be large mother-cells, containing three or more nuclei or perhaps small complete cells ; or there may be nuclei in abundance, which have not yet had a cell-wall developed upon them, to- gether with abundance of molecules and granules. Cancer cells may deviate from the common type,—1st, through want of development ; hence the smallest and least complete cells are found in the quickest growing cancers of the soft variety, and it may be very difficult to distinguish these from tibro-plastic cells. It may be affirmed that small old slowly- growing hard cancers, yield the most per- fect, and large I'apidly-growing cancers the worst developed specimens of cell. 2ndly. Cancer cells present other varieties depending on degenera- tion and oily inliltration ; for cancer, like all other tumours, may decay into a yellow-cheesy tubercle-looking mass. This was described by Miiller as a distinct variety under the name reticular cancer. The cancerous juice which may be squeezed from the freshly-cut sur- face of every cancer, and should be taken up for examination without scraping, is a rather milky liquid, v/hich mixes readily with water into an emulsion. * The strojna, or framework ot cancer, may either be the natural fibrous, or glandular, or other tissue, or else a new fibrous tissue, of varying degrees of firmness, and intermixed in rapidly-growing tumours, with fusiform cells, and other common fibro-plastic elements. Neither nerves nor lymphatics have been found in cancer. Varieties of Cancer.—1.

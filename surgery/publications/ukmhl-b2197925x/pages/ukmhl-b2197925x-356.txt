DISLOCATION OF THE ANKLE. 326 turning inwards. 3. In the dislocation forwards, the foot appears shortened, and the heel lengthened, and the toes pointed downwards. There is also a partial dislocation forwards, in which the tibia is only- half displaced from its articulation with the astragalus, the fibula being also broken ; the foot appears shortened and immoveable, and the heel cannot be brought to the ground. 4. A dislocation bark- wards has been described; but it must be excessively rare, as Sir A. Cooper never saw it. There is a case of it described by Mr. Colles, which, however, was probably one of transverse fracture of the tibia and fibula just above the joint, with displacement back- wards. The fracture of the fibula about three inches above the outer malleolus, which accompanies the dislocation of the tibia, is commonly called Pott's fracture. As a fifth variety, may be quoted the thrust- ing up of the astragalus between the bones of the leg, as represented in the adjoining cut. t Treatment.—These injuries may be so various and complicated, that it is impossible to lay down particular rules for every variety, although » Unreduced dislocation of the tibia inwards, with fracture of fibula; from a cast taken by Mr. Wilmott, of St. Mary's Hospital, a year and a half after the accident. There was no attempt at reduction. t Astragalus thrust up between tibia and fibula, Accident of five years' standing; no attempt had been made at reduction. There was no fracture.

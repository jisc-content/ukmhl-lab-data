500 EPULIS. Treatment,â€”Fomentiitions; removal of the tooth, if much decayed ; and an incision as soon as mattei* can be detected. If the tooth is extracted soon, the sac of the abscess very often comes away with it. XII. Epulis signifies a fibro-plastic or fibrous tumour of the gum. It generally commences between two teeth, which it gradually sepa- rates, then loosens, and finally displaces, and may spread so as to involve several of them. Or it may begin on the free surface of the gum, internal or external, and may form a tumour flat, prominent, polypous, or pendulous. This tumour is indolent, painless, and of slow growth ; but it ought always to be extirpated without delay, because it is liable to increase, and might become the seat of offensive ulceration, to say nothing of the deformity and inconvenience which it occasions. * If possible, it must be cleanly shaved from the periosteum; but if necessary, the tooth on either side must be extracted, and the tumour entirely cut out. A portion of the alveolar process must be removed likewise, if necessary, in order to render the extirpation complete. A similar tumour is sometimes formed when a dead portion of the root of a tooth remains in its socket, and the gum has healed over it. The tumour should be entirely removed with the knife, and the ex- traneous body should be sought for, and be extracted, if possible. Cancerous tumours of the gums are exceeding rare ; they will, how- ever, be recognised by their rapid gi owth, and tendency to haemorrhage, * This cut represents an epulis, in a patient of Mr. H. Walton's; it had existed many years, and interfered with the movements of the tongue and use of the jaws, and so produced great emaciation.

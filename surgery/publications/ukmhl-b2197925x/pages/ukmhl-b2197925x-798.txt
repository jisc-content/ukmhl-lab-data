converging branches of this vessel that were met with at the upper part of the wound. The deep fascia having been divided, and the muscles exposed, the edge of the gastrocnemius is to be drawn aside, in order to expose the soleus. The fibres of the soleus are next to be severed to the extent of the first incision, until the fascia covering its anterior surface is seen, and then this is to be pinched up, perforated, and divided on a director.

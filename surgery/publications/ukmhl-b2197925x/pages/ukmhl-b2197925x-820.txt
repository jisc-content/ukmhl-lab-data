AMPUTATIONS OF THE HAND. 786 through, and the knife, being placed between the carpus and bones of the fore-arm, is made to cut out a flap from the anterior surface of the palm, as represented in the figure (p. 785). The tendons must be short- ened, the styloid processes removed, and the skin brought together by sutures. The radial and ulnar, and sometimes an abnormal median artery, will require ligature after this operation. SECTION X.—AMPUTATIONS OF THE HAND. I. Amputation of the fingers or thumb at their last joint may be performed thus:—The surgeon holds the phalanx firmly between his finger and thumb, and bends it, so as to give prominence to the head of the middie phalanx. He then makes a straight incision across the head of the middle phalanx, so as to cut into the joint, and takes care to carry it deeply enough at the sides to divide the lateral ligaments. The joint being thoroughly opened, the bistoury is carried through it, and made to cut a flap from the palmar surface of the last phalanx, sufficient to cover the head of the bone; and it is better to leave too much than too little. If, however, the joint cannot be bent, this operation may be per- formed thus :—The surgeon holding the phalanx firmly, with its palmar surface upwards, first passes his knife horizontally across the front of the joint, the flat surface towards it, and cuts out the anterior flap; then divides the lateral ligaments and the remaining attachments with one sweep of the knife. II. Amputation at the second joint of the finger or thumb may be performed in the same manner. III. It is always expedient to save as much as possible of the fingers

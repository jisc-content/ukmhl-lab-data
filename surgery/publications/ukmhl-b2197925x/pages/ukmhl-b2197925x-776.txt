OPEEATIONS FOR TYING ARTERIES. 742 sterno-thyroid muscles, and is crossed by the omo-hyoid, generally about two inches above the clavicle. A dense fascia is connected with this muscle. In the upper part of its course, corresponding to the larynx, the sterno-mastoid leaves the carotid, which is then covered only with skin, platysraa, and fascia. Both common carotids termi- nate opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, by dividing into internal and external carotids. The carotid artery, in the lower part of its course, may require to be tied for aneurysm in the upper part of the trunk. In the upper part, the operation may be necessary for haemorrhage or for erectile or other tumours about the face or orbit; moreover, it may be expedient, on Brasdor's principle, in aneurysm too low down to admit of a liga- ture between the disease and the heart. To tie the Carotid in its lower part.â€”The patient being placed on his back, with the shoulders raised, and with the head thrown back and slightly turned towards the opposite side, an incision three inches in length is made on the inner margin of the sterno-mastoid muscle. This incision should be carried through skin, platysma, and superficial fascia, and should extend from opposite the lower part of the thyroid cai tilage, to a quarter of an inch above the sternum. The head should now be turned to the side operated on, and be brought a little forwards, so as to relax the sterno-mastoid muscle, the edge of which is to be

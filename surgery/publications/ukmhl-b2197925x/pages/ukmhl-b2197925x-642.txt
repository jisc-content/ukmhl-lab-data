608 DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS. 4. Puncture of the bladder above the pubes.—This is performed by making a small incision through the linea alba just above the pubes, and then thrusting a long trocar and canula downwards and back- wards into the bladder, where it is not covered by the peritona;um. In performing this operation care should be taken that the point of the instrument does not glide between the bladder and pubis. The canula must be retained, and the patient be kept on his back to prevent extra- vasation; and no time should be lost in restoring the natui'al passage. SECTION II.—PERMANENT STRICTURE. Permanent Stricture signifies a contraction of the urethra, caused usually by inflammation, infiltration of plastic material, and subsequent shrinking of this material and of the canal, and gristly degeneration of the tissues around the canal. But Mr. Hancock has found, contraiy to the general opinion, that lymph may be effused on the free surface of the mucous membrane, and then be developed into imperfect fibrous tissue, partially blocking up the canal. In some cases a small portion of the mucous membrane, perhaps only a line or two in extent, is found thickened and deprived of its natural elasticity ; or perhaps contracted so as to form a sharp fold, as if it had been tied with a thread. But in old neglected cases, the canal with the corpus spongiosum around may be converted into a thick, gristly, cartilaginous mass several inches in extent. The most frequent situation of stric- ture is ''in the substance of the bulbous portion of the camd, or a little anterior to it."* * Henry Smith, F.E.C.S., quoted in Ranking, vol. x., 1849, with an account of examination of ninety-eight specimens.

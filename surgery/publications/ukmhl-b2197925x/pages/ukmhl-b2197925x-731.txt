TALIPES VARUS. 697 tibial tendon deviates to the inner side, and crosses the inner mal- leolus in a curved direction downwards and backwards in proportion to the severity of the case. The posterior tibial tendon does not pass from behind the inner ankle obliquely downwards and forwards, beneath and then in front of this process towards the navicular bone, as in a state of health; because the navicular bone itself is displaced inwards, backwards and upwards, by the contraction of the tibialis posticus muscle, so as to be lield in contact, and articulate with the inner malleolus. The tendon, therefore, passes directly downivards to its insertion, or even with a slight inclination backwards * In fig. 6, this tendon turns a little under the malleolus to reach the navicular. The lujaments are elongated in front of the ankle-joint, and on the convexity of the foot, and shortened in the sole of the foot and behind the ankle-joint, in proportion to the severity of the case, and its duration. Treatment.—In tlie cure of talipes varus, the great practical rule is to divide the treatment into two distinct stages, and to accomplish the objects of the first stage very thoroughly before commencing the second. In the first stage the inversion of the foot is to be overcome by divi- sion of the anterior and posterior tibial tendons, and that of the flexor t longus digitorum ; and then by bandaging the foot to a straight splint placed on the outside of the leg extending to the knee. For an infant * As in case exhibited to the Pathological Society by Mr. H. Thompson, vol. vi., p. 357. t The above four cuts, for which the author has to thank Mr. W. Adams, exhibit—1, talipes varus; 2, the bandage applied after division of the tibialis tendons; 3, the distortion reduced to simple equinus; 4, restoration complete.

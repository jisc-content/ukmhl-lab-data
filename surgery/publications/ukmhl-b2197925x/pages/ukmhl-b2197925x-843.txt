EXCISION OF , THE ANKLE-JOINT. 809 moved together with the integument covering it, which was included between the incisions. Then the astragalus was detached from the tibia and fibula, with great care not to wound the anterior tibial artery. The astragalus was next detached from the scaphoid, and the malleoli were removed with forceps. The posterior tibial artery was tied. The patient recovered, with a fair use of the foot. The front half of the cuboid, with the bases of the 4th and 5th me- tatarsal bones, were removed by Mr. Wood for caries of long standing in the summer of 1864, at King's College Hospital. The patient made an excellent and rapid recovery, with no deformity beyond a small scar, and with excellent use of the foot.

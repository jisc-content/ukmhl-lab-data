754 OPERATIONS FOR TYING ARTERIES. must be slit up, the supinator longus turned aside ; and if the vessel is tied in the upper third, care must be taken to cut between the muscles without wounding them. To tie the Radial Artery on the outer side of the Wrist, an incision should be made through the skin, from opposite the styloid process of the radius, to the commencement of the first interosseous space. The tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, which crosses the artery just before it dips into the palm, is the best guide to it; and it will be easier to tie the vessel on the ulnar side of the tendon. VII. The Ulnar Artery, larger than the radial, passes from the middle of the bend of the elbow obliquely inwards, forming a slight curve with the concavity outwards, and then nearly vertically along the ulnar side of the fore-arm to the wrist; where it passes over the annular ligament on the radial side of the pisiform bone and enters the palm. In the upper half of the arm it is covered by the four super- ficial muscles which arise ft'om the internal condyle. In the lower half it is nearly superficial, and lies between the flexor digitorum sub- imis, and the flexor carpi ulnaris, the latter of which is on the ulnar

48 CHAPTER IX. EXUDATION OF FIBRINE, AND ADHESION. One of the commonest effects of inflammation is fibrinous effusion, the process by which organised .idhesions or bands of false membranes are formed; cavities are filled up, membranes rendered thick, opaque, and rigid, and the substance of organs infiltrated with solid deposits. The material is, so far as we know, the same, whether effused fiom the vessels or generated by the * tissues, as that which has been de- scribed under the head of repair. It may very soon become permeated //y^^ ^.>^. / by blood-vessels, which no doubt are ./t^ -.-'.o^i^/ outgrowths from the nearest capillaries. ^/^^ /' ' ' y 0--) be developed into any of the tissues capable of renovation: i. e., fibrous tissue, bone, or epithelium, forming bands of adhesion, cicatrices, superficial deposits, and thickened © Q. z riiembranes.

(3.) From a continuance of local Irritation and afHux, the lymph may soften into pus. In some cases, as of phlegmonous erysipelas, diffuse inflammation, carbuncle, and the like, the exudation is so aplastic and cacoplastic from the firet as to be incapable of organisation, and so poisonous as to be unfit for absorption, and it softens only into an amorphous puriform fluid. Examples of adhesion.—1. After wounds, in which the efforts of nature at repair have been frustrated, a certain degi-ee of inflammation ensues, and so soon as the inflammation abates, the reparative ma- terial takes the form of granulations. These are composed of plastic cells, in every variety of size, shape, and development, mixed with filamentous intercellular matter. According to the older theory, the lymph effused develops itself into the cells: according to the newer, the cells on the surface increase and multiply, and form the granu- * 1, Lymph, with fibrils and corpuscles; 2.

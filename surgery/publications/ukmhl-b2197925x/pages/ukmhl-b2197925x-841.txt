807 EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOIKT. ing shows a small pad placed on the femur, to keep the end of it from tilthig forwards. During the first few hours, the patient, as after every other opera- tion, should be watched by a surgeon, to guard against shock, vomit- ing, spasm, and haemorrhage. The end aimed at in the operation has been described ; the time which is required to produce it is uncertain; but after five or six weeks the limb may often be lifted, and the patient go on crutches, with the firm confidence that after some months he will have a strong and useful limb, adequate for any active employ- ment. To complain of the time required to rescue a patient from mu- tilation, and give him a useful leg, is absurd. Numerical Results.â€”From the revival in 1850 to December 1854, 31 cases had been collected by Mr. Butcher; from that time to De- cember 1856, when he published his second memoir, 51 additional cases; altogether 82; by the end of December 1858, Mr. Price had collected 79 besides, making 160 in all. Of the 160, 32, or 20 per cent, died; of whom 8 died of pyaemia, and 1 of erysipelas ; these are hospital causes. Exhaustion, irritation, and shock destroyed 15; acute phthisis, peritonitis, pneumonia, suppression of urine, and dysentery each destroyed 1 ; 1 died after amputation; 2 from unknown causes. In 18 cases, one of which was fatal, amputation was obliged to be resorted to, for non-union, abscess, and hectic. In at least 50 per cent, the operation resulted in a good useful limb. It must be added that since that time, Mr. Price collected particulars of nearly 250 cases by various operators, of which

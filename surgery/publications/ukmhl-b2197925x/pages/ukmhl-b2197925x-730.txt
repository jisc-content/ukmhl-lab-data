696 TALIPES VARUS. * Anterior aspect of leg, and dorsum of foot. the navicular bone is drawn directly under the inner malleolus (see fig. 7). These are the only movements essential to varus; but, in some cases, shortening of the foot takes place from contraction of the plantar fascia and flexor brevisâ€”and also in severe cnses, after the period of walking, more or less transverse rotation of the foot takes place from the superincumbent weight telling upon the foot in the act of progression, so as to narrow the transverse arch, and approximate the filth to the fii st metatarsal bones, as seen in fig. 6. As a result of these changes in position affecting different portions of the foot, the bones become somewhat misshapen. The head of the astragalus presents the most important deviation in form, which Mr. Adams, in opposition to Scarpa and Little, describes as existing at birth, 7.* and regards as an adaptation of the bone in its cartilaginous condition to the altered position of the navicular bone. In a severe case, the head of the astragalus, instead of its regularly convex surface directed anteriorly, as in the healthy foot, presents two aiiicular facets at right angles to each other, and divided by an abrupt line; one, the larger, looking directly inwards, and articulating with the displaced navicular bone ; the other, looking directly forw^^irds, is left exposed by the altered portion of the navicular bone, and coveied only by the elongated portion of the ligament which in a healthy state connects these bones. The most important alterations in the direction of the tendons relate to those of the anterior and posterior tibial muscles. The anterior

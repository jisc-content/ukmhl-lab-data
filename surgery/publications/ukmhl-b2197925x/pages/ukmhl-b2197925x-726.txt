Thus, to take the simplest case first, it may be caused by primaiy spasm affecting one or many mus- cles ; and this again may be dependent (in non-con- genital cases), 1st, on a rheu- matic or sub-inflammatory state of those muscles or their nerves; 2ndly, on irri- tation propagated directly from the spinal cord, from actual disorder of that part; 3rdly, on irritation reflected from the spinal cord, but originating in disorder of some other organ, especially of the bowels. The cause of intra-uterine spasm is pro- bably some shock to the ner- vous system of the mother. Secondly^ instead of being caused by primary spasm of any given muscles, it (in non- congenital cases) may be caused by primary paralysis of their an- tagonists ; so that there being no proper balance of forces about the ankle joint, the foot becomes fixed in one of the above- mentioned deformed po- sitions ; probably by a process of adapted atrophy; which is, in plain English, a process by which a muscle shortens itself perma- nently, if long placed in a shortened position. Thirdly. It may be caused as a sequel of * Talipes equinus, from a cast in the King's College Museum, f Talipes varus, from the King's College Museum.

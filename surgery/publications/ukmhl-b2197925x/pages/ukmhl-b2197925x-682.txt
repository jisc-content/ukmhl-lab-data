648 LITHOTRITY. crushing instrument of any value was manufactured by Mr, Weiss in 1824. It was composed of two blades sliding on each other, and brought together by a screw. This is, in essentials, the instrument used at the present day. ISir B. Brodie, however, thought that the screw would act with such violence on a hard calculus that the * bladder would be injured by the flying off of the fragments ; and so for a time it was laid aside. In 1825, Dr. Haygarth invented a sliding instrument, to which a screw was connected at the suggestion of Mr, Hodgson, who tried it on a patient in the Birmingham Hospital in the same year. To this dis- tinguished surgeon belongs the honour of having first performed the modern operation of crushing by the screw. But the method which now acquired celebrity, and which was first practised by Heurteuloup in 1830, consisted in hammering the stone to pieces. The patient was confined to a bed of peculiar construction, called the lit rectangulaire; and the percuteur courbe d marteau—a sliding instrument composed of three blades—was made to seize the stone. This was then broken by i-epeated blows with a hammer on the other extremity of the instrument, which was fixed securely to a vice. But this plan was fraught with many inconveniences. The instrument was too feeble : in one case it was bent up over the pubes ; its blades were apt to become so clogged with pulverised fi-agments, that they were withdrawn w'th ditficulty, or pei-haps not until the orifice of the urethra had been slit up; and the bladder was exposed to injury from pei'cussion communicated from the instrument, and from the violent splitting of the calculus. * Weiss's Lithotrite with screw force.

AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT. 776 the cicatrix is behind the end of the bone, and therefore less liable to be galled in ^vall^ing. In the same manner flaps may be made from the inner and outer sides of the limb, the surgeon first grasping the flesh, and transfixing it, and cutting a flap on one side of the bone, then passing the knife close to the bone on the other side (without again piercing the skin), and making another flap. 3. Teale^s Operation.â€”The surgeon is recommended to begin by marking out the flaps with ink. Taking the circumference of the limb at the point where the bone is to be sawn, half of this wall be the length and breadth of the flap. One line is to be traced on the inner side, as near as may be to the femoral vessels, without including them in the flap; a similar parallel line on the outer side, and a line of equal length joining their lower extremities. A transverse line may then be drawn to show the place of the short flap, which should be one fourth the length of the long one. " The operator begins," says Mr. Teale, " by making the two lateral incisions of the long flap through the integuments only. The transverse incision of this flap, supposing it to run along the upper edge of the patella, is made by a free sweep of the knife, through the skin and tendinous structures, down to the femur." But should the lower transverse line fall across the patella, the skin must be dissected off, and the cut be carried down to the fiemur, above its upper edge. " This flap is completed by cutting the fleshy structures from below upwards, close to the bone." The pos- terior short flap, containing the large vessels and nerves, is made by one sweep of the knife down to the bone ; the soft parts being after- wards separated from the bone close to the periosteum, as far upwards as the intended place of sawing. * This cut, copied from Mr. Teale's book, shows the flaps put together by sutures.

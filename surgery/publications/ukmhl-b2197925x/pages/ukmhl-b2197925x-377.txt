347 ANEUEYSM. The advantages of compression are, that it can be discontinued in a moment should it appear expedient; and that there is no chance of that severe and frequent accident of the ligatureâ€”secondary haemorrhage: and that should it fail, the knife can still be resorted to, without deteri- oration or disadvantage in the condition of the parts. The objections which have been ui'ged against it are, that in some cases the patient, from irritability of system, cannot bear it for a suffi- cient length of time to produce a cure ; and that inflammation and sloughing of the integuments may ensue, especially if there is a de- bility of the circulation, and a want of vitality in the skin. Compression is contraindicated when the integuments ai-e inflamed, or the limb much swelled from venous obstruction ; and likewise in cases which are very rapidly increasing, with little tendency to the formation of fibrinous layers, for there is always a danger of the tumour bursting, or of the limb below becoming mortified. In such cases the ligature must be applied. And if, during the course of treatment by pressure, such circumstances should suddenly arise, it must be at once remitted, and immediate recourse had to ligature of the vessel above. The patient, before undergoing this treatment, should be purged, and during it he must be confined to bed ; the excretions by stool and urine be kept up by aperients and salines; the diet nourishing but not stimulating ; and pain and restlessness be allayed by opium. The skin at the part pressed should be shaved, if necessary, and be well powdered with French chalk. The pressure should not be severe enough to cause great pain; and it should be applied at two or three points, in the course of the femoral artery; being shifted, when it becomes irksome, from one to another. It should not be carried to the point of com- pletely closing the vessel; its most beneficial operation being that of obstructing or lessening the flow of blood so as to relieve the interior of the aneurysm from the force of the heart's impulse and to keep the vessel

Fig. 7 shows another vai'iety of the encysted hernia, in which the sac is apparently formed of tunica vaginalis, but its com- munication with the testicle is closed. Diagnosis.â€”1. The difference between the oblique and direct in^ guinal hernice, and their relations to the epigastric artery, and to the crural ring and Poupart's ligament, are shown in Fig. 8. In the oblique, the neck of the tumour inclines upwards and outwards, and causes a fulness extending up to the middle of Poupart's ligament. In the direct it inclines (if at all) rather inwards; and when the hernia is reduced, the finger, carrying integument before it, can be passed straight back into the abdominal cavity, feeling the edge of the lectus muscle internally, and the os pubis close below. But in old cases of oblique hernia, the neck of the sac is dragged down towards the middle line, so that all distinction is lost. 2. Hydrocele may be distinguished from hernia by its beginning at the bottom of the scrotum ; by its being semi-transparent and Huc- * This diagram, fig. 5, gives an internal view of the parts concerned in the formation of inguinal, crural, umbilical, and obturator hernia ; a, the superficial ring seen through the opening at which direct hernia protudes; 6, the deep ring through which oblique hernia passes ; c, the crural ring; /; the epigastric artery; d, the umbilical ring; e, the obturator opening.

743 COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. exposed, and a vein that usually runs in this dii-ection to be looked for and avoided. With slight use of the finger or handle of the scalpel, the sterno-raastoid must be separated and drawn outwards, and the sterno- hyoid and thyroid muscles inwards. If it will at all make matters more easy, the lower and inner portion of the sterno-mastoid may be divided, and the same may be said of the omo-hyoid, which should now be sought for near the upper part of the incision. The dense fascia which unites this muscle to the sheath must now be scratched through, and the sheath will be seen, with the descendens noni upon it, which should be drawn to the inner side. The greatest care should be taken throughout, and more particulai ly now, to avoid the numerous thyroid and other veins to be met with. The sheath must be pinched up with forceps, and opened with a cautious touch of the knife, whose flat surface should be held towards the artery.

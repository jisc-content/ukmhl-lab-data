516 LARYNGOTOMY AND TRACHEOTOMY. operation should always be performed if there is imminent danger of suffocation, even though the patient's ultimate recovery may be quite hopeless, 3. The operation is sometimes required for tumours, warty ex- crescences, and epithelial growths within the larynx. The symptoms are slowly increasing hoarseness, followed by loss of voice, tickling cough, and noisy breathing; with purulent or bloody expectoration if ulceration occurs. The laryngoscope will confirm the diagnosis. 4. Tracheotomy was proposed nearly 20 years ago by Mr. Mayo, as a palliative in hydrophobia. It was afterwards proposed by Dr. Marshall Hall, in order to relieve or prevent the congestion within tlie head which may precede the sqyqyqv epileptic fits, iroxa the spasmodic closure of the rima glottidis. Experience has decided against the proposal in epilepsy,! and hydrophobia does not kill by suffocation. * 1. Warty excrescences within the larynx. Laryngotomy has been per- formed.

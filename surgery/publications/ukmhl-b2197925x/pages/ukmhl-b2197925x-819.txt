AMPUTATION AT THE WRIST. 785 second circular incision; the interosseous parts and the remaining fibres ai'e next cut through with a cathne; the flesh and the bones are then to be sawn througli togethei', the saw being worked perpendicularly. The radial, ulnar, and one or two interosseous arteries require ligatures. 2. Flaps.—The limb being placed in a state of pronation, the sur- geon makes a flap from the extensor side, just as is represented in the cut (p. 784) ; and he then transtixes the flexor side, and makes the other flap; taking care not to pass the knife between the bones whilst performing either transfixion. The interosseous parts are next divided, the flesh drawn upwards, and the bones sawn through. If the tendons project they must be shortened. Another way of performing the double flap operation at this point is to place the hand in a supine position and to cut the front flap first. Teale's operation is performed, mutatis mutandis, like that of the leg; and that of the upper arm like the thigh. SECTION IX.—AMPUTATION AT THE WRIST. 1. Circular.—The skin being pulled back, a circular incision is made a little below the level of the line that separates the fore-arm from the palm of the hand. Some little dissection will then be required to turn back the integuments as far as the line of the radio-carpal joint. The external lateral ligament is then cut through, and the knife carried across the joint, to divide the remaining attachments. Finally, the styloid processes of the radius and ulna had better be removed with the cutting forceps, and the integuments brought together with sutures. 2. Flaps.—A semilunar incision is made across the back of the wrist, its extremities being at the styloid processes, and its centre reach- ing down as far as the second row of carpal bones. This flap being dissected up, the joint is opened behind, the lateral ligaments are cut D 3 E

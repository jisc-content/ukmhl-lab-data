CHRONIC RHEUMATIC ARTHRITIS. 294 away, leaving the bone bare, and of ivory hardness and polish—a con- dition depending upon a filling up of its canals and interstices with bone tissue, or at least with earthy deposits. This eburnated bone is liable to be worn into grooves, or to be worm-eaten by ulcer- ation. The ligamen- tous textures are usu- ally wasted, unra- velled, or altogether absorbed. The syno- vial membrane thick- ened, vascular, and studded with innu- merable melon-seed- shaped projections, fibrous, cartilaginous, or bony. Symptoms. — The patient complains of racking pain in the affected joint, of a rheumatic, gnawing, weaving character, and sometimes ren- dered worse by changes of weather, sometimes by the heat of the bed at night. It is not usually aggravated by pressing the articular sui'faces against each other. The joint becomes stiff"; its movements limited, and often attended with an audible and sensible grating sound. The muscles ai-ound it become wasted, and the limb often shortened. When the hip is the part affected, the body is bent forwards at an acute angle with the hip ; the step is shoi-t, and the power of flexing the limb on the pelvis, as in going up stairs, very limited. In the shoulder joint, which is frequently the seat of this disease, the glenoid cavity has been found greatly enlarged, completely divested of cartilage, and surrounded with an irregular osseous growth : the glenoid ligament and long tendon of the biceps absent; so "that the head of the humerus may be drawn up and play against the under surface of the acromion, which may be coated with porcellaneous substance ; the head of the humerus increased in size; flattened, divested of cartilage, its cortex thin, and cancelli soft and porous, and the circumference of the anatomical neck overlaid with an irregular growth of bone; the cap- sular ligament generally thickened, but absorbed in certain places, and the tendons connected with it almost entirely atrophied and absent.

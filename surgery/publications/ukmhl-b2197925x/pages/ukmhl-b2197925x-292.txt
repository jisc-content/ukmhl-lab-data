262 FRACTURES OF THE SCAPULA. loops for the shoulders, attached to two pads resting on the scapula, which are drawn together by straps and buckles.* The application of the proper sling in these cases is very important, and its neglect or in- efficiency frequently produces a contorted union of the broken collar- bone. Mr. Wood, of King's College Hospital, recommends its applica- tion in the following way;—A stout silk handkerchief long enough for the purpose is folded cornerwise and laid over the elbow and forearm with the double corner towards the hand. One end of the handker- chief is then carried obliquely along the back to the opposite shoulder, and the other across the chest to meet it; the ends are then crossed over the opposite shoulder, carried under the axilla, and tied behind. The double corner is then carried between the- hand and the breast, and fastened by a needle and thread securely to the upper part of the front end near the shoulder. The hand is thus kept well up towards the opposite shoulder, the elbow well forward, and the whole arm confined efiectively to the side. In cases of willow fracture of the collar-bone in children, the proper application of such a sling is the only means of retention that is neces- sary or effective. IV. Fractures of the Scapula.—The body of this bone may be broken across by gi-eat direct violence. One case is known also in which it was fractured by muscular action.f The symptoms are, great pain * Mr. Vincent treats all fractures and dislocations of the clavicle by merely- placing the patients on flat beds, by which the parts assume and preserve their natural position. Bandages, he says, do little good commonly, and are not required if the patient keeps his bed. Op. cit. t Quoted In Eanbing's Abstract, vol, ii, p. 104.

213 CONSTITUTIONAL SYPHILIS. pain, which begins in the evening, and lasts almost all night, but ceases in the daytime. The pain is shortly accompanied with oblong swellings, called nodes, arising from infiltration of the periosteum with lymph and serum. These swellings are rather tender ; they communi- cate a doughy feeling, or obscure sense of fluctuation to the fingers, and the skin over them is at first pale and moveable. If the disease be arrested at this stage, it causes merely a superficial deposit of rough porous bone (syphilitic exostosis); or else a consolidation of the bone itself through the deposition of fresh osseous matter into its cancelli. If the disease proceed one step further, a quantity of glairy serum is effused between the periosteum and bone, producing an exquisitely-painful fluctuating tumour. If it advance still further, the bone may become carious ; matter form between it and the periosteum ; extensive exfoliations ensue ; the patient suffers severely from the pain and discharge; and if the disease be seated on the head, death may ensue from irritation of the dura mater, or protrusion of the brain through apertures in the skull. Such aggravated cases are fortunately now very rare. V. Of Muscle and Tendon.â€”Tumours called gummata, and * This cut shows the ravages of syphilitic caries. From the King's College Museum.

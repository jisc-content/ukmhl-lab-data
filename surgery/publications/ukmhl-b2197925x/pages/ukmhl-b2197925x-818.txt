AMPUTATION OF THE FORE-ARM. 784 These flaps being dissected up, the capsule of the joint may be opened, the head of the bone turned out of the socket, and the remaining soft parts be divided; or the bone may be sawn through just beneath its neck. An assistant should be directed to grasp the flap which con- tains the axillary artery just before it is divided, because the pressure above the clavicle is generally not sufficient to stop the circulation entirely. SECTION VII.—AMPUTATION AT THE ELBOW. This is performed by passing the knife through the muscles in front of the joint, and cutting upwards and forwai-ds, so as to make a flap from the fore-arm. Then the operator makes a transverse incision be- hind the joint. He next cuts through the external lateral ligament, and enters the joint between the head of the radius and external condyle, then divides the internal lateral ligament, and, lastly, saws through the olecranon^ the apex of which, attached to the triceps, may be left in the stump, or may be afterwards dissected out. SECTION VIII.—AMPUTATION OF THE FORE-ARM. This operation should always be performed as near the wrist as pos- sible. 1. Circular.—The limb being supported with the thumb uppermost, and an assistant drawing up the skm, a circular incision is made through it down to the fascia. When the integuments, assisted by a few touches of the knife, have been retracted as much as possible, and folded back all round for about an inch, the muscles are divided by a

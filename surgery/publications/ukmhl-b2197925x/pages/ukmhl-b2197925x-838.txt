EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 804 laid th^ joint open, and has removed a slice of bone. This point is clearly laid down by Mr. Butcher.* The patient, whilst under chloro- form, suffers no prolonged shock ; and if the bones are found extensively diseased, am- putation should be performed at once. Mr. Feigusson has done this ; and Mr. Hutchin- son, a surgeon no less remark- able for his own successful operations, than for his zeal in collecting accurate statistics. The latest views of Mr. Fer- gusson, as expressed in his lec- tures at the Royal College of Surgeons, in June, 1864, in- cline, however, rather to re- excision (or re-section as be terms it) than to amputation, after unfavourable results from the first operation. In operat- ing on a case which appeared to be suitable for excision, Mr. Hutchinson found the car- tilage gone, the joint surfaces carious, deep ulcers excavated in the patella and tibia, the can- cellous structure of the femur infiltrated with yellow matter, and containing an ill-circum- scribed abscess; and a second slice revealed no better state of things. Amputation, therefore, was immediately performed. The patient had lost nothing by the attempt to save his Imib; and Pedantry only, complaining of such as " disturb her ancient melancholy reign," could object to the proceeding. Â° The operation consists, first, of one or more incisions for laying bare the joint. Mr. Fergusson usually makes an H incision in front of the joint; the lateral lines about four inches long; the cross cut running below the patella. The lateral should, as Mr.^ Butcher says, be placed far enough back to allow the discharge to run out freely, and prevent pouching of matter in the ham. Other surgeons have made a single semicircular flap, running below the patella, with upward extensions * Second Memoir on Excision of the Knee-joint. Dublin Quart Jour Med Science, Feb., 1857.

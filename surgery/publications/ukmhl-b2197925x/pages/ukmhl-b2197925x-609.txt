0)0 IXGUINAL HERNIA. bent, the pubes cleanly shaved, the rupture completely reduced, and chloroform administered, an oblique incision about an inch long is made in the skin of the scrotum over the fundus of the hernial sac. The knife is then carried flatwise under the margins of the incision, so as to separate the skin from the deeper coverings of the sac to the extent of about an inch or rather more all round. (See Fig. 11.) The Fig. 11. forefinger is then passed into the wound, and the detached fascia and fundus of the sac invaginated into the canal. The finger then feels for the lower border of the internal oblique muscle, lifting it forwards to the surface. By this means the outer edge of the conjoined tendon is felt to the inner side of the finger. (See dissection of parts in Fig. 12.) The needle is then carried carefully up to the point of the finger on its inner side, and made to transfix the conjoined tendon, and also the inner pillar of the superficial ring. When the point is seen to raise the skin, the latter is drawn over towards the median line, and the needle made to pierce it as far outward as possible. (See Fig. 13.) A small hook bent on the end of the wire is then attached to the eye of the needle, drawn back with it into the scrotum, and then detached. The finger is next placed behind the outer pillar of the ring, and made to raise that and Poupart's ligament as much as possible from the deeper structures. The needle is then passed along the outer side of the finger, and pushed through Poupart's ligament a little below the deep hernial opening. (See Fig. 14, dissection.) The point is then directed through the same

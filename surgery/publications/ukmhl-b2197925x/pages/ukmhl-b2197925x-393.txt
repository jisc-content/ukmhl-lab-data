INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE NERVES, 363 generation of coagula, in dilated veins. The following figure repre- sents a patient of Mr. Fergusson's, in whom several of these con- cretions formed in pouches of ii-regularly-dilated veins under the lower jaw. They were extirpated by the knife, which is the only remedy available. CHAPTER IX. INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE NERVES. I. Complete division of a nerve produces palsy and loss of sensi- bility in the parts to which it is distributed. The nerve, however, will readily unite in the same manner as bone or tendon, and sensi- bility and motion will return. Sensibility has been known to return in one case in three weeks (in a case related by Paget in ten days), and the power of motion in four weeks, after division. A nerve may also recover its functions after a small piece of it has been rem^oved. Some- times, however, the divided ends, instead of uniting, shrink and be- come bulbous, as they do in a stump after amputation.* * The bulbous ends of a nerve which had not united have been cut out, but without avail.

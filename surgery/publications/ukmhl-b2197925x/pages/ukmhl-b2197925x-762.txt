728 ARTERIOTOMY. with his head towards the surgeon, the latter puts his left thumb on the vein a little above the clavicle, and then opens it with a lancet, cutting towards the thumb, and in a direction downwards and inwards, so that the incision may cross the fibres of the platysma. When blood enough has been taken, the wound should be closed with lint and plaster, and not till then should the thumb be removed. In per- forming the operation of venaesection care must be taken that the open- ing in the skin and fascia is directly over, and rather larger than that in the vein, otherwise an accumulation of blood takes place under the skin, causing a tumour (thrombus) which by pressure upon the vein may stop the flow of blood. This is especially the case in rense- section of the jugular if the fibres of the platysma are not properly divided. The veins in the leg, scrotum, or neighbourhood of the eye or ear, can readily be opened in the same manner, instead of the ordinary mode of venassection, or leeching, or cupping. Abscess in the areolar tissue, inflammation under the fascia, phlebitis, neuralgia, varicose aneurysm, and aneurysmal varix, are occasional ill consequences of venaesection. IV. Arteriotomy.—The temporal artery should be opened above the outer angle of the eyebrow—not just above the zygoma. The surgeon feels for the largest branch—usually the anterior—steadies it with two fingers, one placed above, and the other below, the intended puncture—then pushes in the lancet in the same manner as in ve- naesection. The incision should be directed across the vessel, and should cut it about half through. When sufficient blood has flowed, the best plan is to introduce the lancet, and cut the vessel completely across, so that its ends may retract. A firm graduated compress should then be applied, and be confined with a bandage passing round the

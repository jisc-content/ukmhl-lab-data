AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. 779 is severed. The patella should be brought down over the end of the femur. SECTION IV.—AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. 1. Double flap Amputation at the upper fourth of the leg.—This useful operation, practised by Mr. Syme and the late Mr. Liston, is performed a little below the knee-ioint, the bones being sawn about two inches below the tubercle of the tibia. It makes the most useful kind of stump for the labouring man, who is best accommodated with a stiff wooden or peg leg, since the pressure is borne by the callous skin and bone of the front part of the tibial tuberosity with the knee bent as in kneeling. The stump being short, does not project behind beyond the socket of the leg, and is much less in the way than a longer stump. The operation is performed in the following way. * This diagram represents the lines of incision in the double flap and oval amputations. t Oval amputation, before the stump is put together.

130 PART III. DIFFERENT KINDS OF INJURIES. CHAPTER I. BRUISES AND SUBCUTANEOUS INJURIES. SECTION I.—INTRODUCTION. Definition.—Injuries attended with the division of various tissues, without wound of the skin ; or if with a wound of the skin, one which is very slight and quickly healed. This definition includes bruises or contusions, that is, injuries in- flicted by blows with blunt weapons,.as well as strains or sprains, which consist in the rupture of tendinous or ligamentous fibres, by over-stretching; besides simple fractures and dislocations, and those subcutaneous wounds which are made by surgeons in tenotomy and other operations. Pathology.—There is a great distinction between injuries without and with wound of skin ; for, as Hunter said, wounds, " in which the parts do not communicate externally seldom inflame, while those of the second order commonly both inflame and suppurate." The general progress of subcutaneous injuries is this. At first there is a certain amount of pain, consisting in a perpetuation of the original sensation of injury. There is some amount of extravasation from the blood-vessels which are torn: and there will be probably in twenty- four hours some amount of throbbing or infiammatori/ pain, with an increase of swelling, from inflammatory exudation. But if the case does well, all inflammation soon ceases; inflammatory exudation and effused blood are absorbed ; and there is a growth of pure plastic material, which fills the gap of the severed muscle tendon or bone as the case may be, and which infiltrates slightly the adjoining portions of tissue. This soon begins to organise itself, after the manner described in the Chapter on Repair, and becomes a fibrous tissue, by which any severed parts are united. If the blood be in a diseased state, and charged with material for

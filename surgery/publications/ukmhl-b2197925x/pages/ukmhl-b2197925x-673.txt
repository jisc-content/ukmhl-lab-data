639 GRAVEL. quantity that is passed during twenty-four hours should be collected into one vessel; so that its acidity and speciric gravity and quantity may be flxirly estimated. We may observe as a further preliminary, that when a precipitate is let fall from the urine after it has been voided, it is called a sediment; that when precipitated in the bladder or kidneys it is called gravel; and that gravel lodging in any part of the urinary passages may concrete into stone. Further, that when the urine of any person habitually pre- sents any one kind of deposit, he is generally said to have a correspond- ing diathesis; as the lithic diathesis, &c. The principal diseased conditions we are at present concerned with are those in which the urine deposits—1st, uric or lithic acid; 2ndly, oxa- late of lime ; 3rdly, phosphates. 1. Li thic, or Uric Acid, or Red Gravel.'—This is deposited in the form of minute crystals, tinged with the colouring matter of the urine. It generally indicates a highly acid state of the urine, through which it is precipitated from the ammonia and other substances which ought to be held in solution. The amorphous Uthates of ammonia, soda, and lime form a very common sediment, varying in colour from nearly white to dark red or yellow. The ui'ine from which it is deposited is generally acid; clear when passed, but clouded as it cools; and this sediment may readily be distinguished by its dissolving when heated slightly. Lithates, deeply tinged by pink or brick-dust colouring matter, form the sediments observed in fever, gout, and chronic diseases of the liver. The lithate of soda is sometimes found. II.

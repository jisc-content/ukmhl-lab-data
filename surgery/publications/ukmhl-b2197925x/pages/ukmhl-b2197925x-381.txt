351 In some instances the arterial character predominates; the tumour, if situated in the skin, being of a vivid scarlet, and pulsating strongly ; in others, it is of a most dusky hue and venous character. In some instances, again, the affection seems to be confined to the larger blood- vessels, with little, if any, implication of the smaller ones. If the arteries are affected (as shown in the following figure), the tumour (which is sometimes designated aneurysm by anastomosis) is tense and pulsates vividly ; if the Veins, they feel like a bunch of earth-worms, and are easily emptied. The most frequent situations are the skin, and subcutaneous cellular tissue, especially about the head. It has been found in bone. The causes are unknown. The disease is usually congenital. The vulgar idea is, that a lobster, or raspberry, or some such thing has been longed for by the mother, and that the influence of her mind has impressed on the foetus the image of the thing she longed for. It may originate, however, later in life. Symptoms.â€”Nsevus of the skin may present itself as a mere red speck or patch, or as a soft raised swelling, dusky or scarlet, according as it is arterial or venous. The subcutaneous nsevus feels soft, and very much hke a fatty tumour, except that firm pressure will usually cause it to be emptied and to disappear. " Some of these tumours," says Mr. Listen, " communicate a thrill to the fingers; they can be emptied to a certain extent, by uniform and continued pressure, or by inter- rupting the circulation, and are instantly filled on permitting the blood again to flow into or towards them. The large ones pulsate syn- chronous with the heai t's action. They are much increased in size by anything that increases the activity of the circulation ; as the cries of children, and the violent exertion of adults. On the application of the stethoscope, pulsation is heard as in common aneurysmal tumours, and

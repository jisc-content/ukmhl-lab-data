435 THE OPHTHALMOSCOPE. such an extent as almost to hide the disc (fig. 3). Hyperasmia of the disc is common in those cases of impaired vision from overwork, which Fig. 3. are met with in the case of engravers, compositors, sempstresses, &c. Blood may be effused on the surface of the disc, constituting what has been called apoplexy of the papilla. Black pigmental deposits are occasionally seen on its surface, and frequently at its edge. The disc may present a cupped appearance, as in glaucoma, where it is said to be indicative of intra-ocular pressure; or an elevated appearance of its centre. The form of the vessels entering and leaving the centre, and the nature of the shadow, as shown by varying the light, will be the best means of ascertaining in these cases which state is present. Atrophy of the Disc is far from uncommon ; it is often congenital; it is sometimes found in a squinting eye, and is often associated with excessive myopia. In cases of atrophy of the disc, the retina generally preserves its normal condition and vascularity. The optic disc does not always preserve its circular form; it is occasionally jagged in its out- line, and pigmentary deposits are of frequent occurrence at its edge. From the choroidal degeneration which is often seen around its circum- ference, and from the white shining appearance of the sclerotic through the retina, the edge of the disc may be but indistinctly defined, and the crescentic patches of sclerotic may be confounded with the outline of the disc by the beginner; but to the practised eye the outline may always be distinguished. The Retina.â€”Its transparency should be unimpaired, and its vascu- larity not greatly different from that of the healthy state. If the disc be hyperemic, it will naturally partake of the extra vascularity, but not always ; for the disc may be injected with small vessels, while the re-

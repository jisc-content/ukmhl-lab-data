687 PARTIAL HYPERTROPHY, Cp. 109). The growth of glandular or fibro-plastic matter, projecting into the cavities of the cysts, was formerly designated by the name sero-cystic sarcoma. The abundant formation of epithelium has in- duced some persons, most improperly, to describe this disease as epithe- lial cancer. We may add that portions are often found softened, and in a state of fatty decay. The growth is usually slow. The size attained may be enormous. Mr. Fergusson, in 1853, removed one weighing twenty- seven pounds. No age is exempt ; yet the majority of cases occur in women under thirty-five. The tumour generally commences at the circumference of the breast, and is produced by the hypertrophy of one lobule. It is moveable under the skin; feels granulated just as the natural organ does when its tissue is developed by lactation or during menstruation; may increase so as to cover over and hide, or cause atrophy of the remainder of the organ ; yet is not attended with retrac- tion of the nipple, or adhesions, or enlargement of the lymphatic glands. There may be pai7i, especially at the menstrual period, at which time the entire gland becomes more enlarged and tender; yet not the wearing pain of cancer. When cysts are formed, fluctuation becomes perceptible at one or more points ; the disease increases slowly or quickly ; at last it distends the skin, and a round aperture is formed, from which a cauliflower excrescence sprouts out; and the pain and discharge may be very ruinous to the health. The disease may last almost any number of years, and may increase to a great size without greatly affecting the health. In some cases it disappears of itself; in others it remains stationary.

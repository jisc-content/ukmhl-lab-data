314 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. outwards, so as to relax the deltoid, supraspinatus, and biceps muscles. When extension has been made for some "minutes, the surgeon should lift the head of the bone with his knee, and it will frequently return with a snap. 2. The extension may be performed in the same direction with the aid of the pulleys; recollecting always that they are not to be used in order to exert greater force, but to exert it 7nore equably. A damp bandage should be applied round the elbow, to protect the skin before the strap of the pulleys is attached. 3. By the heel in the axilla. The patient lies down on a bed, and the surgeon sits on the edge. He puts his heel (without his boot^* into the axilla, to press the head of the bone upwards and outwards, and at the same time pulls the limb downwards and a little forwards, by menus of a towel fastened round the elbow. 4. By the knee in the axilla. The patient being seated in a chair, the surgeon places one of his knees in the axilla, resting the foot on the chair. He then puts his hand on the shoulder to fix the scapula, and with the other depresses the elbow over his knee. 5. According to the method invented by Mr. White of Manchester, and revived by Malgaigne, the patient lies down, and the surgeon sits behind him. The scapula is well fixed, by placing one hand upon the shoulder, or by passing a jack-towel over the shoulder and fixing it to the opposite corner of the bed ; then the arm is raised from the side, and drawn straight up by the head, till the bone is thus elevated into its socket. Modifications of this process have long been in use on the Continent; and there is no doubt but that English bone-setters have some plan * A case is related by Dr. Warren, of Boston, in which a person made a violent attempt to reduce a dislocation by putting tlie heel of his boot into the axilla. The result was a rupture of the axillary artery. Vide Banking's Abstract, vol. iii. p. 43.

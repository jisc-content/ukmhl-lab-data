PERMANENT STRICTURE. 613 by means of a fine wire which lies in the groove. The travellers are of various sizes. The instrument is made by Weiss. Mr. T. Wakley's instruments.â€”Tiiey consist of, firstly, a very small catheter, A, which is to be passed through the stricture into the bladder. Secondly, a slender steel rod, B, which is next to be passed within the catheter and screwed into it. This rod and the catheter thus united form a directing-rod, over which other instruments are to be passed. Thirdly, there is a series of straight silver tubes, c, of graduated sizes ; the smallest just one size larger than the directing- rod; the largest equal to a No. 10 bougie. Each of these tubes is constructed so as to glide accurately over the directing-rod ; and thus, the latter being in the urethra, any stricture can be dilated to as great an extent as the surgeon thinks prudent at one sitting. Of course the size of our page prevents the artist from showing more than two ends of these instruments ; the middle will readily be imagined by the reader. In the next place, Mr. Holfs improvement of M Perreve's instru- ment, may be mentioned. It consists of a staff, formed of two blades, A and B, joined at the smaller extremity, C, and capable of diverging by means of a screw, D, at the handle. Between them is a directing- t * Mr. Wakley's Dilator. See Lancet for 1851, vol. i., p. 122. t Mr. Holt's Stricture Dilator.

280 FRACTURE OF THE FEMUR. placed reaching from hip to heel. The feet are not included under the sheet, but kept in a symmetrical position with each other. In the United States, this injury has lately been much treated upon a plan of Dr. Nathan Smith's. This consists in placing along the front of the limb from the pelvis to the toe a piece of iron wire, of the thickness of a No, 10 or 12 catheter. This is bent at the knee and ankle joints into an easy angle and tastened to the limb, without being permitted to touch it, by adhesive plaster and a roller, omitting au interval if there be any wound. The wire and limb are then suspended to the ceiling of the room by a hook and cord, the latter being fastened to the wire in two places, one above another below the knee. Ex- tension is made by the degree of obliquity given to the suspending cord, and counter-extension by raising the foot of the bed on bi icks, so that the inert gravity of the trunk tends towards the head in the opposite direction. Mr. Fergusson has devised a modification of the straight splint, con- sisting of a long iron bar, of the length of the ordinary straight splint; the upper half of which can be unscrewed and removed, so as to make

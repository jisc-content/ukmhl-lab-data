578 STRANGULATED INGUINAL HERNIA. 2. The irreducible inguinal hernia must be supported with a bag- ti-uss. If it contain only omentum, a common truss is sometimes Fig. 14. Fig. 15. applied in the usual manner, so as to make the omentum adhere to and plug the neck of the sac. But this cannot often be borne, and is liable to induce swelled testicle. For these cases, a ring pad truss on Wood's principle, with an India-rubber water cushion, is the most comfortable and effective apparatus.* 3. In attempting the reduction of strangulated oblique inguinal hernia, the patient should be placed with his body bent forward, his pelvis raised, and his thighs as close together as possible (although the surgeon must put one arm between them), and the pressure must be made upwards and outwards. The operation for this hernia is performed thus :â€”The parts being shaved, and the skin made tense, an incision three or four inches long must be made through the skin, along the axis of the tumour, begin- ning from above its neck. This will be quite long enough, even for the largest hernia; because the object is to bring the seat of stricture fully into view, without exposing too much of the sac. Then the sue- very aggravated and exceptional character, an enormously large hernia with a very large opening into the cavity of the belly, and a lax and indefinite neck. * Wood, On Rupture, Inguinal, Crural, and Umbilical.

DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 386 Museum, made by Mr. Hewett, who kindly obtained permission for the author to have this drawing made. The patient was five months old, and died under Mr. Tatum's care. The cavity of the tumour is seen to be intersected by the branches of the cauda equina. The nerves passing out of the spinal canal at the upper part of the opening, run across the cavity of the tumour to its posterior wall, where they are firmly fixed, the nerves being here flattened and spread out upon a fine membrane. From the sac, the anterior branches of the first four sacral nerves return in distinct bundles, forming large. loops, to the anterior sacral foramina, through which they pass as usual to form the sacral plexuses. The fluid had evidently been effused between the visceral arachnoid and pia-mater ; and the walls of the sac were formed by the visceral and parietal arachnoid and by the skin, all of vvhich were much thickened, and firmly united to each other. In cases like this in which the nerves pass through the cavity of the tumour, it is probable that the fluid was originally in the subarachnoid cellular tissue, after partial adhesions had formed between the nerves, and the two layers of arachnoid covering its posterior surface. But in some cases the nerves are found spread out upon the posterior wall of the sac, without passing through its cavity ; and in these most pro- bably the fluid was effused into the subarachnoid cellular tissue, after extensive adhesions had united the cord and its nerves to the two layers of arachnoid covering its posterior surface. Whereas, if the fluid be

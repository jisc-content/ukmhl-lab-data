ANEURYSM. 343 toms of disordered circulation and respiration. Tn the abdomen, an aneurysmal tumour may be felt through the parietes. Diagnosis.—Other tumours situated over ai'teries, and receiving con- tiguous pulsation fi'om them, may be distinguished from aneurysm by noticing, 1st. That they do not pulsate at first, when they are small; whereas aneurysms do so from their earliest formation. 2ndly. That a tumour may often be lifted up from the artery, and that then it will cease to pulsate. 3rdly. That aneurysms are generally soft at first, and become hard sub- sequently ; tumours are gene- rally the reverse. 4thly. That tumours cannot he emptied by pressure; and that no alteration is made in their size or consistence by com- pressing the artery above. 5thly. Enlarged lobes of the thyroid gland may be distin- guished from aneurysm of the carotid by their slipping up out of the fingers, along with the larynx, in the act of deglu- tition. 6thly. Psoas abscess may be known from aneurysm by the precui'sory pain and weakness in the back; and by its disappearance when the patient lies down. 7thly. Pulsating tumours composed of erectile or of cancerous growths—especially those con- ' nected with bone—are some- / times mistaken ibr aneu- rysms ; from which, in fact, it may be hardly possible to distinguish them during life, since they may have the same kind of pulsation, at- tended with the same whizzing noise, and checked, like that of aneu- rysm, by pressure on the artery above. The mistake, however, is ot * 'I'his drawing exhibits an aneurysm of the common femoral artery, for which the external iliac was tied by Sir B. Brodie. The ligature is seen im- bedded in lymph; the coagulum in the artery above and below it; and the laminated coagula in the aneurysm. From the Museum of St. George's Hospital.

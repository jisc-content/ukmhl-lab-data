344 ANEURYSM. no very serious consequence, because the ligature of the main artery, which would cure an aneurysm, might check the growth of a tumour. 8thly. The contiguous impulse of a tumour in contact with an artery is in one and the same direction in all its parts, whereas, in an aneurysm it is an impulse radiating in all directions from a common centre, a dilating impulse. This may be demonstrated by placing the ends of two quills or lead pencils on opposite sides of the tumour, if the impulse be a true dilating impulse the pencils will diverge from each other, but not by a contiguous impulse. Progress.â€”As an aneurysm enlarges, its coats become thinner, but are strengthened by the adhesion of the parts around. As the enlarge- ment proceeds, these are gradually absorbed ; bone offers r.o resistance, but is absorbed as well; and at last the tumour reaches the skin and distends it. Inflammation succeeds ; the skin becomes red, then livid and vesicated ; and sloughs. When the edge of the slough separates, a fatal bleeding ensues; sometimes in a gush enough to destroy life at once, although more frequently the blood oozes away slowly. But an aneurysm may open into a mucous canal; or into a serous cavity ; ov into a vein, with, of course, a fatal disturbance of the circulation if the vein is large ; or into the cellular tissue of a limb ; or it may cause death through its pressure on the trachea or oesophagus; or through the pain and irritation created by its compressing nerves or interfering with the abdominal viscera, without bursting. We may observe, that when an aneurysm opens into a mucous canal (as shown in the follow- ing figure), it is usually by a small round ulcerated spot, not by a slough, Fig. 1* Fig. 2. * Figure ] exhibits a front, and Fig. 2 a back view of an aneurysm of the arch of the aorta, which burst into the trachea.

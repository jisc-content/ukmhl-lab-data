577 STRAKGULATED INGUINAL HERNIA. enter and emerge at the same cutaneous aperture, without any inci- sion of the skin. During their application the forefinger invaginates tlie thin skin of the scrotum into the hernial canal, and thus protects the important deep-seated parts. The same structures are transfixed as desciibed in the preceding operation. The pins are bent at a right angle near the blunt end, and provided with loops at the bent part (see Fig. 17, p. 579), so that each can be locked into the loop of the other, and then by a half turn can be twisted round so as to entwine closely the included structures, and cause them to adhere intimately as the pins ulcerate nearer to each other, and finally meet. By the oblique direction of the pins an adhesion along the whole length of the canal between the surfaces of the perforated sac;, and the tendinous walls of the canal and pillars of the ring is insured. Out of 100 cases of all kinds and every degree of severity of inguinal rupture, opei'ated upon by this surgeon, no less than 68 have proved up to the present time satisfactory cures. Many of the patients were operated on five or six years ago, and in the less severe cases have worn no truss after the first few months. One only died. The fatal result occurred three weeks after the operation, from pyamia then prevalent in the hospital. Most of those not entirely cured have been much improved, and a truss made available, Kone have been made worse by the operation.* * In a case at wLicli this surgeon lately assisted Mr. Walton, of St. Mary's Hospital, the patient died a week after from peritonitis. This case was of a D 2 P Fig. 13.

FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 278 sists of extension of the limb by the long splint, and a circular girth with a pad, to support the upper extremity of the shaft, and keep the broken surfaces in apposition. (4.) Fracture of the Epiphysis of the Tro- chanter Major.—The trochanter is sometimes broken off from the femur, at the part where it is united by cartilage, as an epiphysis in youth. The diagnosis is generally obscure; but we allude to the accident in order that the surgeon may be aware of the possibility of such an occurrence. The part will unite by ligament. (5.) Fracture of the Femur just below the Trochanters is liable to be followed by great deformity, because, as Sir A. Cooper said, the upper fragment is tilted forwards by the psoas and iliacus. Yet Mr. Butcher has shown that it is generally the lower fragment which is drawn upwards and outwards by the power- ful action of the hamstring muscles and glu- tens maximus.* (6.) Fracture of the shaft of the Femur requires no observations as to its causes or symptoms. Treatment. — For all cases of fractured thigh, including those of fracture of the cervix, in which the patient's strength admits of a reasonable effort to procure union, the long splint is the best instrument. The com- mon long splint, known as Liston's, is repre- sented in the next cut. It is a narrow deal board, of a hand's breadth for an adult but narrower and slighter for a young person. It should be long enough to reach from below the axilla to four or five inches below the toot. At its upper end it has two holes, and at its lower end two deep notches, with a hollow for the outer ankle. * Butcher on Fractiues of the Femur, Dublin Quarterly Jour. Med. Sc., Feb.1853.

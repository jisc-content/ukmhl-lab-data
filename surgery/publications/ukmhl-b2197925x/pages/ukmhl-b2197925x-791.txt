757 EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. To tie the External Iliac, the patient should lie flat on a table, in order that the abdominal muscles may be rendered rather tense. An incision, three and a half or four inches long, should be made above and parallel to Ponpart's ligament, beginning about half an inch outside the external abdominal ring. It should be carried through skin and the superficial fascia, and be completed so as to lay bare the external oblique tendon. If the external epigastric artery be divided, as is probable, it should be secured. The tendon of the external oblique should next be cut through to the same extent, either on a director, or not. The internal oblique and transversalis muscles are now to be similarly divided; and as they vary in thickness, and as the peritonaeum is close behind, this part of the opei-ation must be conducted with great delicacy. A portion of the muscle should be lifted with forceps, and be carefully cut through, to form an opening into which the finger, or a large blunt director may be insinuated, and upon which the muscle may be divided. The edges of the wound should now be gently drawn asunder by bent spatulse; the fascia transversalis be exposed and scratched through, and the opening be enlarged by tearing with the fingers. And next the peritonseum should be most delicately stripped off, from the walls of the abdomen and from the iliac fossa, till the finger reaches the artery, as it gradually rises from the pelvis. The sheath must be scratched through with the finger-nail or a director at the point selected, and the artery separated from the vein ; the aneurysm-needle should be passed between them, and the genito-crural

356 puncture, the thread being entirely sunk into the puncture nearest to the operator, as seen in the adjoining figure (see tig. 2). The ends are then each made to pass through the loop, and tied very tightly in a loop knot, so as to leave the power of tightening it as the parts inclosed shrink under the ulcerative process. As the thread is tightened, the loop recedes into the puncture, but is held there by the ends passing through it, and the pressure exercised throughout is everywhere equalized. By this method the suppuration and sloughs formed by the najvus escape by the two punctures along with the thread. Two small spots of cicatrix remain the only evidence of the operation having been done. A method analogous to extirpation is, the dwision of all the soft parts around the tumour. This was once done successfully by Mr. Lawrence, in an aneurysm by anastomosis on the finger. He divided all the soft parts, except the tendons and thecae. But in other cases it has been unavailing. If the disease is inaccessible to any of these means (as in the orbit) and increases rapidly, ligature of the common carotid (or of whatever other large vascular trunk supplies it) is the only resource. The figure in the preceding page represents a case of this disease, chiefly of a venous character, in a female, about thirty yeais of age. Mr. Storks tied the common carotid artery, with the effect of producing

It is an operation which is easily performed by any one who has the proper instruments, and uses them with ordinary care ; and it is one which if unskilfully or carelessly performed may lead to very serious results, to say nothing of the suffering which it inflicts. We beg the reader, therefore, to study well the construction of the instruments employed, and to practise with them on the dead body, before he tries his hand on the living. They are the forceps, the ele- vator, and the key. 1. The forceps is the instrument that is now generally employed by dentists. It should be made with sharp edges, so that it may be pushed up between the tooth and the gum, and should seize the tooth by its neck, close to the alveolus.

Stumps in the upper jaw may be extracted with

095 TALIPES VARUS. exists in the healthy condition of the foot; and in talipes varus the inversion of the foot takes place essentially from this centre of motion, and involves only the anterior two-thirds of the foot. The posterior third of the foot, consist- ing of the OS calcis and astragalus, has its centre of motion in the ankle-joint, from the construction of which it can only move in the direction of flexion and extension ; at least this is essentially the direction of its motion. In a severe case as that I'epresented, the posterior third of the foot is elevated by the action of the muscles of the calf upon the os calcis, and the astragalus is raised from its horizontal into a vertical position ; its centre of motion being at the ankle-joint. The anterior two-thirds of the foot are drawn inwards and up- wards, producing the inversion charac- teristic of varus, by contraction of the tibialis anticus and posticus, the flexor longus digitorum, and in severe cases the extensor and flexor pollicis; its centre of motion at the great tarsal jomt is indicated by the dotted line in figs. 6 and 7.

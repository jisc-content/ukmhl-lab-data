802 EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. such cases of injury or disease as would otherwise be submitted to amputation in order to save the patient's life, or enable him to en- joy ic. The object of the operation is to produce a firm and useful limb, slightly shortened, and with entire bony anchylosis, or fibrous union admitting of some small degree of motion at the situation of the joint. But all cases are not suitable for excision. And those cases are un- suitable, and better adapted for amputation, in which either the quan- tity of diseased bone requiring removal is very great—for then the case will probably not do well—or if it proceed to recovery, and the patient be young, the future growth of the limb may be prevented; or the quality of the disease may be such as experience has shown to be incompatible with the exudation of healthy material of repair. This last is a point which has been very clearly stated by Mr. Price.! If the "white sweUing" has begun with disease of the synovial membrane (see pp. 289, 298) or so-called ulceration of car- tilage, the diseased joint surfaces may be cut off, and the case * The above drawing represents a patient of Mr. Price's, a young woman set. 26, whose left knee was excised in October, 1856. The patella was retained; but was cut out after a year, because abscesses continued to form around it.

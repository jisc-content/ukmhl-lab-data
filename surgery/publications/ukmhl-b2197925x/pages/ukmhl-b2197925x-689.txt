The left forefinger nail is now to be well fixed in the groove of the staff, the knife is slipped in over it, with its flat surface nearly hori- zontal ; its point is made to pierce the tissues covering the staff and to enter the groove, and to slide along the groove towards the bladder, dividing the membranous part of the uiethra, and the edge of the prostate. This completes what the French would call the second temps. Now the knife being withdrawn, the left forefinger is gently in- sinuated along the staff into the bladder with a rotatory kind of motion, dilating the parts as it enters ; and is made to feel for the stone. "By it, too," says Mr. Thompson, " the surgeon takes a kind of hold of the bladder and maintains his communication with it." In the next place, the assistant removes the staff, and the surgeon cautiously introduces the forceps over the finger into the bladder ; the finger being with- drawn as the instrument enters. And, at this moment, Mr. Fer- gusson, with admirable dexterity, opens the forceps, and with a turn of the wrist, giving a scooping motion to the open blades, catches the stone as it is brought within their jaws by the gush of urine that escapes. For it must be observed, that so closely does the finger follow the knife into the bladder, that no urine escapes till the finger is withdrawn.

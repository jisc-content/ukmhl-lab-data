VENISECTION. 727 passed through the centre and be made to cut one line of a V incision first, and the other afterwards. Or two instruments may be used together. The ecraseur was invented by M. Chassaignac, and in- troduced into England by the late lamented Mr. Price. III. Venjssection at the bend of the arm should always, if possible, be performed in the median- cephalic vein. A ligature being placed a little above the elbow (but not tightly enough to stop the pulse at the wrist), the operator takes the forearm in his hand, places his thumb on the vein a little below the intended puncture, and then (using the right hand for the right arm, and vice versa) pushes the lancet obliquely into the vein, and makes it cut its way directly outwards. When sufficient blood has been taken, the surgeon should untie the ligature above the elbow, and place his thumb on the bleeding aperture. Next he should put a little bit of lint on the wound, and secure that with a strip of plaster, only removing his thumb sufficiently to admit of the application. Then he should remove his thumb enough to put on a little square compress of linen, and over that the middle of a bandage. This is to be passed round the elbow in the form of a figure of 8, and the two ends are to be crossed and turned backwards over the compress. The next figure (p. 728) is intended to show the way in which the surgeon should grasp the arm, and keep his thumb over the bleeding aperture till the bandage is secured. The jugular vein is some- times opened in cases of apoplexy in adults, and in children if the veins at the elbow are hidden by fat. The patient, if a child, being laid in a nurse's lap, * This cut shows the veins of the bend of the elbow, together wi tion of the brachial artery to the median basilic vein. ith the rela-

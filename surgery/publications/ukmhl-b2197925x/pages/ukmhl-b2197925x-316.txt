FRACTURES OF THE LEG. 286 usually much inflammation, and not much separation of fragments; so that position and bandages suffice, * after inflammation has been subdued. 3. Compound Fracture of the knee-joint will require excision or amputation, if the skin is very much torn, or the bones comminuted; and amputation if the popliteal vessels are injured likewise. If the vessels are entire, and the bone not commi- nuted, nor the skin torn away, an effort may be made to save the limb. XIII. Fractures of the Leg. —The ordinary fractures of the leg may be readily distinguished by cai-e- ful examination. There are several methods of treatment. (1.) By the common splints.—The injured leg being laid on its outer side, the fracture is reduced by extension from the knee and ankle. Then a many-tailed bandage is applied by some surgeons after the manner represented in the cut. This bandage is easily made thus:— take a piece of roller, long enough to reach from the knee to the foot, and to overlap about one-third of the leg besides. Cut another roller into pieces, and lay them across the first at right angles, in such a manner that each shall overlap one-third of the preceding one : these transverse pieces (which should be half as long again as the circumfe- rence of that part of the leg which they are to encircle) are to be stitched to the longitudinal one, and then the bandage is ready for use. One splint, well padded, should be applied to the outer side of the * Comminuted fracture of the patella, partially united by bone. From a patient of Mr. Partridge's.

Indolent abscesses, some time after opening, may be treated with injections of iodine lotion, or of zinc or copper lotion.

The thin red skin overlapping the edges of an ulcer or abscess, which is inclined to heal, may be removed by a touch with iodine paint. Such are the chief points worthy of notice in the local treatment of scrofulous abscesses and ulcers. V. Tabes Mesenterica, or Marasmus, consists in a tubercular disease of the mesenteric glands, and of the follicles of the intestines, precisely similar in its course and phenomena to the same disease in the cervical glands. The diseased intestines inflame, adhere together, and ulcerate, so that openings form between different convolutions; and on examination the peritonaeum is found as thick as leather, and the intes- tines resembling a collection of cells rather than a simple tube. Symptoms.—Emaciation and voracity, owing to the obstructed course of the chyle; the belly swelled and hard; the skin dry and harsh ; the eyes red ; the tongue strawberry-coloured ; the breath foul ; the stools clay-coloured and offensive, sometimes costive, sometimes extremely relaxed. The patient of course dies hectic, although he often lasts wonderfully long. Treatment.—Animal food and other nutriment given in small quan- tities at short intervals; mild mercurials to amend the intestinal secretions, especially the combination of corrosive sublimate with tinc- ture of bark, F. 87 ; tepid salt bathing; stimulating liniments to tlie abdomen ; change of air ; and the cautious administration of the anti- scrofulous remedies before mentioned, especially the cod-liver oil. * Represents enlargement of tlie mesenteric glands from a scrofulous patient.

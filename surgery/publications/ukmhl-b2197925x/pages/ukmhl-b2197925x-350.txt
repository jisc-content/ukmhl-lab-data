320 DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP. and shape ; but when once the head of the bone is replaced in its socket, it remains there.* Treatment.â€”As we have said at pp. 309 and 315, dislocations may- be reduced hj manoeuvring or by main force : the former being the preferable plan if it can be adopted. The manoeuvre by which a dislocated hip can be reduced (sometimes called the flexion method) consists in employing the length of the limb as a lever and the trochanter as a fulcrum, by which the head may be got into such a position as to slip into its socket. For this purpose the knee must be bent on the thigh, and the thigh on the pelvis: the * There are a few cases on record of fracture of the upper extremity of the femur, in which a portion of the great trochanter was brolien off, and drawn by the muscles backwards on the dorsum ilii, into the position usually occupied by the head of the bone when dislocated ; so that the nature of the accident was obscure; but there was no shortening.

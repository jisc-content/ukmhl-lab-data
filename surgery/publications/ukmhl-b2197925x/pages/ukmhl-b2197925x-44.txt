14 CONVULSIONS. CHAPTER V. CONVULSIONS. In order to complete the view of nervous disorders produced by local injury or disease, it is necessary briefly to allude to convulsions, occur- ring in epileptiform paroxysms. These are familiar in medical practice, when arising from irritation of the gums, of the stomach, of the uterus, &c.; they also occur occasionally from some of the local affections which custom has assigned to the surgeon. In particular, they may arise from spicula of bone growing from the inner surface of the skull ; or from slight injuries to the skull which have left the bone unsound ; and especially from irritation of the urinary organs; retention of urine, renal calculus, and the like. In children, convulsions are apt to be pro- duced by severe injuries or diseases of any kind, at the time when the nervous system is beginning to be exhausted. The symptoms it is not necessary to describe in this place. As to the treatment, the following are the main indications: 1. To search for, and remove, or soothe any external source of irritation. 2. To eva- cuate disordered seci-etions. 3. To lessen accumulation of blood in the central organs of the nervous system, if it exist, as indicated by tirm pulse, and turgid lips, eyes, and countenance. Ice to the head, and mustard to the feet, are almost equivalent to a cupping. 4. In the opposite class of cases, with feeble pulse, pale face, and dilated pupil, to give beef-tea and brandy. 5. In all cases to give sufficient nourishment.

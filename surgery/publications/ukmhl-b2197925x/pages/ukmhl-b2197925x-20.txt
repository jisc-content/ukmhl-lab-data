PREFACE. xvi to the lot of the practitioner, but not for those intricate sabjects which claim special treatises to themselves. I find that the collection of formulse at the end of the work has been received with great favour, and I have added to them considerably. Many of them are original prescrip- tions by masters of repute, and others are such as I use in my own practice. It were greatly to be wished that the search for specifics be continued with vigour. We want remedies which shall do for the exudations or cell-growths of cancer, fibro-plastic tumours, carbuncle, and the like, what mercury, iodide of potassium, and salts of ammonia do unquestionably in some cases of inflammatory, rheumatic, scrofulous, and syphilitic deposits. Such remedies can never be guessed at, or argued out a priori^ but can only be attained empirically ; that is, by observation and experiment; and I hope I need not repeat to ray readers that the true "science" of medicine is based, not on a priori argument, but on the results of practice.

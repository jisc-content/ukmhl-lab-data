EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 803 will do well; or if there be decayed scrofulous exudation, tubercular as it is called, into the bone structure, and it be in one or more circumscribed masses, bounded by a layer of lymph and healthy bone, these masses, when laid bare by the section of the bone, may be gouged out, as a dentist would deal with a carious tooth, and if sound bone be left the case will do well. Not so, if, as Mr. Price remarks, the scrofulous exudation be diffused throughout the cancellous tissue; if the whole area of the bone be enlarged and softened, with its cancelli filled with strumous deposit. and its periosteum thickened and separating. In such a case, the whole disease can scarcely be removed, and diseased bone is left, incapable of healthy exudation. Low inflammation, repeated abscesses, and fresh operations to remove carious or necrosed fragments will be the almost certain result, and if the patient do not die of exhaustion or pysemia, he must go through amputation at last. Here it may be observed, that since there are no absolute diagnostic marks of the various forms and degrees of joint disease, it may happen that the surgeon must sometimes come to a final decision after he has * This represents a boy, aged 9, whose knee was cut out by Mr. Price, July 20, 1856 : for a time he did well, but never had good use of the limb, which at the end of two years and three months presented the appearance shown above. The limb was then amputated, and he recovered. After the amputation, the ends of the bones which had suffered excision were macerated, and are repre- sented in the next cut. Evidently the causes of failure were the intensely strumous diathesis, the softened and unhealthy state of the bones, and the formation of numerous abscesses in the soft parts, which had been the seat of disease fcr four years before the excision.

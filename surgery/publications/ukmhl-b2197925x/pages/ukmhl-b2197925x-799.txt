765 POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. tact with it, and not unfrequently surround it by anastomoses. The nerve is superficial to, and sometimes a little on the outer side of the artery. If the artery is not readily found, and there should appear to be want of room to look for it, some of the fibres of the soleus may be cut across. Instead of directing the soleus to be cut, some operators have pro- posed to separate its tibial origin from the bone. If this he done, the first incision should be made higher up, and nearer to the tibia. The objections to it are, that in case of injury, when the muscles are swollen and infiltrated with blood, it would be very difficult to distinguish between the attachments of the soleus and those of the flexor longus digitorum and tibialis posticus ; so that all of the muscles of the leg might be detached, and the interosseous membrane reached, instead of the artery. Again, supposing the soleus to be correctly separated from the bone, it is no easy matter to draw the muscle sufficiently aside to expose the artery. This operation is considered by Mr. Guthrie to be so " painful, diffi- cult, bloody, tedious, and dangerous," that he proposes to reach the artery hj making a perpendicular incision six or seven inches in length, at the back of the leg, through the skin, gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus; then the fascia will be exposed with the artery beneath it, and the nerve to the outer side or lying directly over it. Perhaps this ope- ration cannot be spoken of in much more complimentary terms than the preceding one. To tie the Posterior Tibial in the middle of the leg.â€”An incision must be made three inches long, half in the middle third of the leg, half in

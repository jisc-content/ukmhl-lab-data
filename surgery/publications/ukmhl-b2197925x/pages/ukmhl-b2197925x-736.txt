EXOSTOSIS. 702 snipped off close all round with a small pair of scissors, and the poul- tice, if inflamed, applied, or lead lotion. If not inflamed, the zinc ointment is the best remedy. If the tip of the finger is long painful and tender without suppurating, it should be well pencilled with lunar caustic. The resin ointment is recommended by Mr. Vincent as an application, after the part has been opened. The tendinous whitlow, or thecal abscess, affects the tendinous sheath or periosteum, and was described at p. 232. We may observe here, however, that if purgatives and fomentations do not speedily relieve, the finger should be freely laid open with a scalpel. The knife should be canied deep enough to feel the resistance of the bone or tendon, so as fairly to open the sheath of the latter. If matter have extended into the palm, the incision should be continued along the metacarpal bone till it freely gushes out. It is better not to cut into the spaces between the metacarpal bones (unless matter points there very deci- dedly indeed), for fear of wounding the digital artery. If it be neces- sary to slit up the palmar fascia, a cut should be made over the head of a metacarpal bone, in order that a director may be passed under it. The carbuncular whitlow is an unhealthy infiltration of the subcu- taneous tissue of the finger, brawny, slow to suppurate, and altogether resembling, and requiring the treatment of, carbuncle, p. 228. XIII. Exostosis.â€”A fibrous tumour, which subsequently ossifies, is not uncommon on the dorsal surface of the last phalanx of the great toe. To cut away the anterior half of the nail, and dissect it out, is the only useful treatment.* * See Barwell on the Cure of Club-foot without cutting Tendons. Lond., 1863.: E. J.

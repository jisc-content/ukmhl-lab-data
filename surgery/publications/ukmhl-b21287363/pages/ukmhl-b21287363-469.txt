461 ENUCLEATION. first sliding a blade of the scissors beneath the conjunctiva as close as practicable to the cornea then working it toward the limbus with a sort of riving motion, the incision can be made very close to the base of the cornea. Still holding the bite of the forceps the con- junctiva is undermined for a few mm. all round, and the anterior prolongation of Tenon's capsule is likewise incised. Still keeping the grasp of the forceps, the scissors are exchanged for a hook which is. inserted beneath the tendon of the superior rectus, and, thereafter, one hook or the other serves to fix the globe. The forceps is laid Fig. 231.â€”Severing tendon of externus in enucleation. aside, the hook shifted to the left hand, the scissors again taken, the conjunctiva and capsule pushed back to expose the caughi-up tendon, and the latter severed by cutting from heel toward point of hook. Before freeing the point, however, and allowing the eye to roll upward again, and without dropping the scissors, the second hook is inserted. In this way the hooks and scissors are carried around the spiral, and continuous line of insertion of all the recti muscles, never letting go with one hook till the other is in place. It is the aim to always leave enough tissue engaged by the tip of

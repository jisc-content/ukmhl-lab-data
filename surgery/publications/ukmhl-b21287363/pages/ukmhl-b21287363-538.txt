EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. 53° a tiny ellipse. The idea is that this hole shall form a sluice gate, as it were, for the aqueous in case of after-opening of the incision, thereby preventing prolapse or impalement of the iris. Variations of Technic.—The different steps of the operation for cataract extraction with the corneal flap, as described in a previous chapter, are by no means constant, but are subject to many modifications and changes, according either to the peculiarities of the case, or to the views of individual operators. It is the purpose of this section, therefore, to cite some of the changes in, or departures from, prevalent methods, or, rather, from the methods already described. Holding the Lids Apart.—Some surgeons prefer to operate for cataract without the blepharostat, instead, having an assistant perform this service with his fingers or with the Desmarres retractors. The fingers alone are unreliable, especially in the event of a squeezing subject. The retractors, or at least one retractor for the upper lid, is a safe and effective means of holding the lids. A new and highly efficient retractor is that devised by Fisher, of Chicago. Shown in Fig. 241. Its handle is of spring steel, and lies over the frontal bone. Thus both the handle of the instrument and the hand that holds it are out of the way of the operator. Fixation of the Globe.—One may employ a fixation forceps provided with a locking device, but this does not conform to the later and more approved ideas. Many unpleasant accidents have occurred as a result of the lock, for it is apt to prove stubborn in an emergency, and is, on the whole, best dispensed with. An excellent method of fixation, and one peculiarly adapted to use in connection with deeply set eyes, is that of Czermak. This consists in grasping the tissue at the middle of the inferonasal quadrant of the corneal limbus, in lieu of that

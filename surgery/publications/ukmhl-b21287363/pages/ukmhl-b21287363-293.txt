ECTROPION AND BLEPHAROPLASTY. Fig. 158.—Dieffenbach, No. 1. FlG. 157.—Beard's operation for elongated lower lid. an equilateral triangle. The skin and muscle thus enclosed were extirpated. The outer edge of the lower lid was pared off for a distance coinciding with the length of one side of the triangle. The skin at the inner side of the angle and beneath the outer half of the lid was undermined, the whole lower lid slid out- ward, closing the angular opening, and the coapt- ing edges were sutured. Thus the pared, or raw, part of the lid margin becomes the lower lip of the primary, or hori- zontal, incision (Figs. 158, 159). Method of Szyma- nowski.1—With a view to the elimination of the downward traction of the scar on the outer commissure and also to the enhancement of the effect, this surgeon has changed the form and axis of the Dieffenbach triangle (Fig. 160). That is, he places its apex at the commissure, extends one short side up and out, gives it a long, vertical base; then a third side, of intermediate length, leading back to the canthus. In other respects the method does not differ from Dieffen- bach's. Thus, the upward slant of the short side gives the pro- cedure added capacity for lifting up the lid, and the long, narrow cicatrix, extending as it does both up and down from the level of the commissure, does not tend to the latter's displacement. The effect, moreover, is easier to dose than is that of the older operation. The outer portion of the lid border AD is prepared by removing its edge to a depth sufficient to include the hair follicles, and for a 1 Graefe-Saemisch Handb., Bd. iii, S. 4(16.

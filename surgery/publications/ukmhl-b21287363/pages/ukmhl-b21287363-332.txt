OPERATIONS UPON THE CONJUNCTIVA. 324 bulbar opening are undermined and united by fine silk sutures, the knots of which are not too tightly tied (Figs. 193 and 194). When the loosening of the lid from the eye leaves a de- fect too broad to be covered by simple lateral mobilization of the membrane, peduncu- lated flaps are fashioned from a part somewhat further away and turned in to fill the gap—a method first practised by Teale.1 In de- taching the symblepharon, if only its point involved the cornea, this surgeon made an incision across the growth, at the limbus, and left the corneal portion which was supposed to dwindle away from atrophy. The rest he separated in the usual way and (in downward symblepharon) took a vertical flap from either side of the cornea (Fig. 195); the two were disposed one above the other on the defect, to cover it, stitched together, and, also, to the cut edge of the pterygoid above, and to the lid flap below. The secondary de- fects were closed by simply drawing the conjunctiva to- gether by sutures (Fig. 196). Teale,2 at a later period, made an arched bridge flap from the lateral and upper conjunctiva which he slid down over the cornea, and Stitched into Fig. 196—Teale-Knapp operation.

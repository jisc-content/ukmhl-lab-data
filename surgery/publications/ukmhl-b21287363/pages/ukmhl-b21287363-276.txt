ENTROPION. 268 curved needles and holder or Reverdin's needle with handle. The ■ needles should be small, fine, and sharp. Large ones cause needless traumatism. No. 2, braided, black, silk thread, boiled in paraffin, makes an excellent suture, of which three are put in, the first one midway of the tarsus and the other two, one on either side five or six millimeters away. Each needle is passed from below, through the lower flap just far enough from the edge to insure a firm hold for forty-eight hours, then through a small, horizontal fold of the tarso-orbital fascia, picked up in the forceps, just above the convex border of the tarsus, thence high up beneath the superior flap, and brought out through the muscle and skin but a short distance below the super- cilia. To make the fold or tuck in the fascia, slightly dig the needle into it just where the crest should be, pull it up and grasp the base of the raised part with the mouse-tooth forceps, so Fig. 141.—Beard's method for entropion. ag tQ form a horizontal pleat and shows course of sutures. 1 pass the needle through, close to the jaws of the forceps (Fig. 141). Eighth step. Tying the Sutures.—Here the closest attention to the detail of every maneuver is of the greatest moment. The lips of the intermarginal incision will now be found tightly glued together by fibrin. They are parted with the points of the closed scissors and all shreds cleaned out. So, too, as regards the flaps of the external opening. They are lifted up, and all blood, etc., removed from under them, so that they may slide over tarsus and fascia. The central suture is tied first. A double turn is made in the thread and the lower end given to the aid, while the operator holds the upper between thumb and index. The edge of the lower lip of the cut is grasped with the mouse-tooth forceps near the thread to be tied, and drawn up, turned backward and placed in contact with the

478 " CHAPTER XI. EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. Condition of Patient's General Health.—All that is requisite in this particular is that the patient be in his usual health and that this should be such as to give a reasonable expectation of life. While it is well, as a routine practice, to make careful physical examination, there are really very few pathological conditions existing in cataract subjects, as we find them, that are actual contraindications as regards the operation of extraction. Although it is almost the universal custom (with the writer among the rest) to ascertain the exact condition of the urine; neither diabetes nor nephritis are actual bars to the operation so long as dissolution is not imminent. The same may be said of cardiac disease, aortic insufficiency, etc. General arteriosclerosis, while it makes one fear expulsive hemorrhage from the choroid, should not cause rejection, but should lead to ■extreme caution and to the institution of appropriate preparatory measures as regards diet and other regimen; also the exhibition of remedies whose effects are supposed to counteract the evils of this disease. Age of the Subject.—Extreme old age of itself should not stand in the way. The writer's eldest subject was ninety-two, and the result was all that could be desired. On the other hand,- given an unusually youthful subject for senile cataract, the question merely hinges upon the kind of cataract and the manner of operating to be undertaken. Condition of the Eye and its Appendages.—There should be no thought of operating for cataract upon an eye so long as there is any active inflammatory condition of either the globe or its ap- pendages, such as conjunctivitis, acute catarrhal disease of the lacrimal canal, and, above all, dacryo-cystoblennorrhea. These, when present, even in the opposite eye, should first be got rid of.

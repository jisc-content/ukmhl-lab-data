279 ECTROPION AND BLEPHAROPLASTY. PLATE prominent fold of the exposed conjunctiva, obliquely through the tarso-orbital fascia, at its junction with the tarsus, on down and forward to emerge from the skin opposite the rim of the orbit (Fig. 147). They enter about one half centimeter apart, and their courses very slightly diverge. Two or, at most, three such sutures are placed and each pair is tied over a cylinder of gauze or tubing. The tension put upon them is just sufficient to cause a slight entropion. They are left in for several weeks or until suppuration appears around them, the eye being meanwhile bandaged, with daily renewal and cleansing. Silver thread is pre- ferred to that of silk by a number of surgeons, the assumption being that the metal is better tolerated. T think, however, that if the silk is thoroughly boiled in paraffin, so that it will not act like an open path for the entrance of bacteria, that it will be found superior to any other material. Argyll-Robertson1 devised a knot which he used in conjunction with a lead plate. The needles of a double-armed suture were passed from in front, through the whole thickness of the lid, each one about six or seven millimeters from the middle line, and two millimeters from the border. Then carried free over the conjunctiva and, entering at the bottom of the cul-de-sac, were brought out on the cheek some thirty-two milli- meters below the lid-margin. Before tying the ends over tubing a lead plate (25 x 6 x 1 millimeters), with ends and corners smoothly rounded, was slid beneath the threads lying on the conjunctiva. The object of the plate was to straighten the out-curve of the tarsus and the infold of the fascia resulting from the ectropion (Fig. 148).

CANTHOPLASTY. 219 will go without any stretching and is joined to the upper lip of the incision (Fig. 93). Another suture is placed to unite the lower skin and mucous lips, and the operation is finished—unless, perchance, one chooses to put in a third or superficial suture to close the small skin angle thus left unclosed. As each suture is put in, if it be not tied at once, the two ends of thread are laid together on the temple where an aid places a finger on them to insure keeping them to themselves. They are tied with the canthus stretched open, in order to see that they are true and do not cut out of the conjunctiva. Several other ingenious and effective varieties of canthoplasty have been devised and extensively practised. Attention is called to three: 1. Richet1 resected a dart of skin and tarso- orbital fascia whose base was the canthus- and whose point reached outward horizontally one and one-half centi- meters. A median horizontal incision was made in the outer wall of the external conjunctival cul-de-sac thus laid bare, and the cut edges were stitched to those of the skin. 2. David Prince,2 of Jacksonville, 111., made a cutaneous incision, beginning on a level with, and three or four centimeters from the commissure, down and in, parallel with the lower lid border, one- third to one-half of the length of the latter; then from this point out and up back to the level of the canthus, but several millmeters further toward the temple. The curved angle of skin thus marked out was dissected up from apex to base. A third incision joined this base and the canthus, the upper lip of which was undermined for a centimeter or more toward the brow, a double-armed suture Fig. 93—Canthoplasty. 1 Trait, d'anat. med. chir., 1851. 2 Am.

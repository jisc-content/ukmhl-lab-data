297 ECTROPION AND BLEPHAROPLASTY. The procedure was systematized and given its first real impetus by Fricke.1 His operations related mainly to the correction of ci- catricial ectropion—the tarsus, conjunctiva, and free border having been intact. Fricke's perfected operation was as follows: given a case of complete cicatricial ectropion of the upper lid, for example, Fig. 176. an incision was made between cilia and supercilia, parallel with the rim of the orbit, the tarsus loosened from its attachments, and turned down into place, thus leaving an oval raw surface (Fig. 175). A flap, somewhat larger than the oval, was cut from the forehead and temple, whose base, broader than the body of the flap—not a Fig. 177. pedicle in the strict sense of the word—was situated a little external to the margin of the orbit and slightly above the operated lid. Before turning the flap into its new position, the bridge of skin between the two raw areas was excised sufficiently to receive the 1 Bildung neuer Augenlider nach Zerstorung und dadurch hervorge- brachter Auswartswendung derselben.

IMMEDIATE ACCIDENTS, ETC. 5°3 ACCIDENTS AND COMPLICATIONS. The accidents and complications that may occur in connection with extraction are divided into immediate and consecutive, the former having reference to those that are incident to the operation itself, and the latter to those that may involve the after-treatment. In either instance, when they arise, their origin may be due to one of a number of causes. Lack of skill, care, or experience on the part of the surgeon must stand first in the list of causes. Next in prominence, perhaps, comes want of control and ignorance on the part of the patient. Third, incompetency and neglect on the part of assistants, and, lastly, a whole group of causes for which no one may be held responsible. In this chapter, therefore, an attempt will be made to enumerate the various undesirable happenings and, in so far as possible, to suggest appropriate preventives and remedies; for they all incline to embarrass the operator and to jeopardize his ultimate success. Reviewed in the order of occurrence they are: IMMEDIATE. 1. Accident.—Over or prolonged cocainization, causing drying and exfoliation of corneal epithelium, bleeding from conjunctival flap, hypotonicity of the globe, collapse of the cornea, and delayed union of the lips of the wound. Preventive.—Use only two to four drops of a 4% solution. Keep the lids closed and covered with wet cotton between whiles, so as to prevent drying of cornea, and make the operation under the primary effect of the drug. Remedy.—Defer the operation until another day or the next day. 2. Accident.—Touching the eye with the fingers. Preventive.—Obvious. Remedy.—Douche the eye copiously with warm boric acid solu- tion. 3. Accident.—Allowing the knife or any instrument to touch cilia, skin or any object other than that desired. Preventive.—Obvious.

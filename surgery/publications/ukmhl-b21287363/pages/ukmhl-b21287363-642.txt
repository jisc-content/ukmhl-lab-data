THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. 632 izing method consisting of two metal indicators, one pointing to the center of the cornea and the other situated to the outer canthus at a known distance from the first.* Two exposures are made in order to give different relations of the shadows of the indicators and of the body in the eyeball, one with the ray tube horizontal or nearly so with the plane of the indicators, and the other with the tube below this plane. The principle of this method may be understood from the pro- spective drawing, Fig. 278. Rays coming from the light situated at A cast shadows of two ball-pointed rods and an object in the eyeball, and give the view shown on the sur- face C. In this instance the tube is in front of the vertical plane of the two indicators, and consequently the shadow of the center ball will be thrown back of that of the outer ball. When the light is carried below the plane of the two indicators, the shadows of the two rods are formed on the surface D, and the shadow of the foreign body in the eye assumes a new position. It the distance of one of the indicating rods from the center of the cornea is known, and the distance between the two indicators is measured, the position of the metal in the eye may be determined, since the shadow of the foreign body preserves at all times fixed relation to the shadows of the indicating balls in whatever position the light is placed. Accurate localization requires that the axis of the eyeball shall be parallel with the two indicators and with the photographic plate, * The methods of Sweet and their description are taken partly from the work of Hansell and Sweet on "Diseases of the Eye," and partly from a paper read by Sweet at the meeting of the American Ophthalmological Society, July, 1909.

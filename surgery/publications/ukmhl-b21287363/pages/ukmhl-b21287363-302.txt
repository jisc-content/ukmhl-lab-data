Szymanowsky,1 with the view to a closer approximation of the secondary defect, and in order to obtain more tissue for replacing loss in the lower lid, extended the incisions according to the dotted lines (Fig. 169). For the restora- tion of the inner half of the lower lid, Arlt modified the operation as shown in Fig. 171. To avoid the outward stretching of the new lid and the displacement of the external commissure that would result from the Dieffenbach procedure, Harlan,2 of Philadelphia, made the rather elaborate operation pictured in Fig. 172. The broad space beneath the eye was narrowed as much as practicable by undermining and bringing the lower edges together before sliding the flap into place, and the same was done with the second triangle on the temple. Thus, not only was the secondary defect reduced in size, but so elevated as, by its healing, Fig. 171.—Arlt. Fig. 172.—Harlan. not to exert an evil influence on the position of the lids. Another advantage claimed was that, being stitched on either side to sound skin, the nutrition of the new lid was better assured than if, on one 1 Graefe-Saemisch, iii, S. 476. 2 Norris and Oliver, p. 117-118, ii

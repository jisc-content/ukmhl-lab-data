Kuhnt considers the combined excision the best prophylactic against pannus. Fig. 211.—Combined excision of the tarsus. Disposition of sutures. 3. Isolated Excision of the Tarsus. In this procedure all of the upper tarsus but a narrow strip at the free border is excised; but the overlying conjunctiva is spared, kuhnt, its author, considers it valuable in the cicatricial stage after the original disease has disappeared, leaving a thick, infiltrated tarsus, exciting pannus, and as a preventive of ptosis and slow atrophy.

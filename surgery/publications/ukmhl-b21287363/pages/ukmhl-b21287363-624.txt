616 CHAPTER XIII. THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE EYE. Foreign bodies within the eye are threatening or dangerous to the integrity of the organ in accordance with: 1. The degree and nature of the traumatism they produce in entering. This may be due to direct wounding or, as in case of hot substances, to burning. 2. The condition of the injury with respect to infection, either carried in by the foreign body itself or occurring from without. This may vary from absolute immunity to the presence of sepsis in the greatest virulence. 3. Their location. Those lodged in, or in contact with, the uveal tract, causing the greatest reaction; next, those in the vitreous body; then, the retina, and, lastly, those in the lens. 4. Their chemical composition. Such as are readily oxidizable, like copper and iron, being more potent for evil than the noble metals or even than lead and zinc. Copper, according to the investigations of Leber, has the property of giving rise not only to violent uveitis, but also to suppuration, whether in connection with pathogenic germs or not. The different intraocular tissues exhibit about the same relative tolerance of the decomposition as of the presence of the foreign body. 5. The extent to which they become encapsuled, i.e., with or- ganized blood-clot or inflammatory exudations. 6. The duration of their abode. The longer the time, the less likely they are to give trouble. 7. Their qualities with respect to diagnosis, recognition, or localization. Glass, for example, is one of the most difficult of substances to find with the eye and to extract because of its trans- parency. True, it is rather opaque to the X-rays. Others, again, are transparent to these rays, and escape observation through ob- scuration of the media. Still others, of whatever composition, elude all forms of search by their minuteness.

THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. 634 drawn through the points E and F gives the direction of the rays when the second negative was made. Since these two lines in- dicate the plane of the shadow of the foreign body at each exposure, the intersection of the lines must be the location of the metal in the eye as measured above or below the horizontal plane of the globe and to the temporal or nasal side. To determine the distance of the foreign body back of the center of the cornea, the negative made with the tube horizontal is taken, and the distance is measured that the shadow of the ball opposite the center of the cornea lies posterior to that of the external ball. J3 Fig. 280.â€”Radiograph made with tube near plane of indicators. (Hansell and Sweet.) This distance is entered directly above the external ball on the diagram representing the horizontal section of the eyeball. A line drawn from K through he center ball gives the direction of the rays at the time the radiograph was made. On the same negative is measured the distance that the shadow of the foreign body is back of the shadow of each of the indicators, and these distances, B J and A H, are entered on the diagram. A line drawn through the points J and H and, since this line represents the plane of the shadow of the foreign body, the point at which a perpendicular drawn from the situation of metal, as shown on the vertical section of the eyeball, intersects this line indicates the situation of the body back of the center of the cornea. If the position of the tube from the eye has

257 ORGANIC OR CICATRICIAL ENTROPION. anterior, composed of the skin holding the cilia and their follicles; the posterior, of the tarsus and conjunctiva. An ellipse of integument, the length of the palpebral fissure, was removed just above the roots of the lashes, and the latter, with their loosened bridge, slid up and fixed to be out of the way. This is the identical operation that was revived by G. Jasche1 and that, modified by v. Arlt,2 had such a tremendous though ephemeral vogue, under the name of "Verab- schiebung des Wimperbo- dens nach Jasche-Arlt," or, in English, transplantation of the eyelashes (Figs. 126 and 127). The great faults of this procedure were: (a) want of a fixed point above for the upper edge of the flap; (b) lack of support from below, so that the cilia gradually descended until they again rested on the eyeball; and (c) no attention was paid to the incurvation of the tarsus; nor (el) to the atrophy of the conjunctiva and restoration of the free border; (e) to the relief of lid tension; (/) to drawing up the loose underhang of the cilia; nor (g) the counteract- ing of the tendency to ptosis. The need (a) was found by Anagnostakis,5 of Athens, who chose the upper border of the tarsus (Fig. 128). He made a cutaneous incision the length of the tarsus, only three millimeters from the free border, opened it up, and resected a strip of the orbicularis overlying the upper border of the tarsus, and to the 1 Med.

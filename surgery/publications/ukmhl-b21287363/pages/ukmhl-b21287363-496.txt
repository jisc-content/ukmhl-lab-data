EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. 488 Puncture.—The point is placed exactly at the apparent sclero- corneal junction, just on a level with the union of the middle and upper thirds of the vertical diameter of the corneal base. Puncture and counterpuncture may be a trifle lower, of course, but it is hardly wise to begin higher. Rest the little finger on the patient's cheek, and have him look down—not a bad idea to direct him also to hold the mouth and the other eye wide open. The handle of the knife is elevated to about 450 to a tangent of the corneal curve, and Fig. 234.—Puncture and counter-puncture. pushed until, just as it is entering the anterior chamber, the handle is depressed, in one sense, till the blade is brought parallel with the plane of the corneal base, and elevated, in another sense, so as to point toward the center of the pupil, advancing all the while; then again depressed (toward the patient's feet) and made to emerge from the anterior chamber precisely opposite to the point of entrance {counterpuncture) (Fig. 234). Now, onward, vigorously, without hesitation, first pushing up the blade to make the cut on the inner side of the cornea, then pulling it up to cut the outer side, holding it flat on the iris, and following the apparent sclerocorneal junction—

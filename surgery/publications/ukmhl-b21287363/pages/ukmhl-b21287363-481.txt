ENUCLEATION—CONSECUTIVE ACCIDENTS. 473 of our sincerest commiseration. Let every ophthalmic surgeon see to it, henceforth, that this calamity does not happen through fault of his or through that of anyone else connected with the case. Never trust in the matter to those who prepare the patient for the opera- tion. Examine the eye immediately beforehand. If the one to be removed has no conspicuously distinguishing external feature—as in intraocular tumor—shave the brow upon that side, or, better still, place a mark upon the forehead adjacent. CONSECUTIVE ACCIDENTS. 1. Secondary Hemorrhage. This is a contingency against which we have been repeatedly warned, yet one that seldom arises. The writer has never encountered it. Unlikely though it be, one must be prepared to meet it. For this reason it is best to have the case under strict surveillance for at least 24 hours after the operation. A mere sanguinary staining of the dressings signifies nothing. Should it be discovered that blood actually trickles from beneath the coverings of the eye, the bandage must be taken off and measures instituted tending to stop the flow—iced compresses to the lids, hot sublimate irrigation, and tamponment of the open socket, with re- application of the compressive bandage; or, if need be, recourse to the more extreme ways and means mentioned under "Immediate Accidents." 2. Infection.—Cellulitis of the orbit, ascending meningitis, and thrombophlebitis of the ophthalmic vein and its adnexes are the truly grave sequels that enucleation can engender. But with due regard to the laws of modern surgical prophylaxis and to the in- tegrity of the protecting fascia of the orbital tissues, their advent is scarcely to be apprehended. There are three main factors for the prevention of the accident in question that one should strive to eliminate, viz.: unclean implements, needless wounding or opening of Tenon's capsule and contamination from the tissues involved. The first is accomplished in great measure by thorough boiling of the instruments and cleansing of the hands; the second, by carefully dissecting up the anterior prolongation of the capsule, picking up and dividing the tendons of the ocular muscles close to the sclera with the least disturbance of the aponeurotic wrappings, and the

ECTROPION. Fig. 186. 3Â°2 the muscle and the tarsus, and the anchylosis between the tarsus and underlying tissue is entirely freed. "The removal of all scar tissue," once thought imperative, is no longer so rigidly insisted upon. The harder masses are best gotten rid of, perhaps, but to attempt the excision of all of it is not feasible. The same allowance is made for the subsequent contraction of the oval bared.space thus created, as for that of the skin that is to cover it. Hence, this preliminary opening up is made extreme; to such a degree, for example, that for complete ectropion of the upper lid its free border would overlap the lower lid and lie upon the cheek, opposite the inferior portion of the rim of the orbit or even below it. The more recent the injury that caused the misplace- ment, the greater must be this overeffect. If the operation is to restore the lid after removal of a growth, or the excision of an ulcer that involves the whole thickness, the conservation of the maximum amount of the conjunctiva is important. For the entire upper (or lower) lid or any part external to the middle, the pedicle is best situated about on a level with, and close to, the outer canthus, and the long axis of the flap should be directed upward (or downward). Some of the older surgeons have ad- vised that a flap to replace the upper lid be taken from the malar region, and one for the lower from the temple, for the reason that the strain of cicatrization in the secondary defect will, in this arrange- ment, tend to enhance the desired effect. As regards the body of the second bared space, however, it signifies but little, yet, as con- cerns the position of the pedicle, it does make a difference. On account of its proximity to the original defect, to elevate it for the

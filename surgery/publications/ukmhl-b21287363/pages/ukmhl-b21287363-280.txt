If one will take the pains, however, to ex- amine a few lids that have been subjected to the operation, he will be readily convinced that the graft after a comparatively short time, really takes the place of conjunctiva in that it lies in contact with the cornea. Fig. 143.â€”The expression of face before "the altogether operation." Others have urged as an objection to the mucous graft, that its shrinkage is greater than one of skin.

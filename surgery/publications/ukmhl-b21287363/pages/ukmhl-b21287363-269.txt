261 ORGANIC OR CICATRICIAL ENTROPION. Fig. 134 —Dianoux's entropion operation. the line of cilia beneath the entire flap (not through it), and the fastening them by collodion to the brow (Figs. 136 and 137). This dissection and the draw- up of the lower flap, ing partly meet requirement (/). The point wherein it fails of the condition is the fact that the threads push the ciliary strip up instead of pulling it up and ] Hitting it on the stretch. A. Pagenstecher1 made an incision just below the upper border of the tarsus, opened it up wide, exposed the tarso- orbital fascia, which was caught up in a horizontal fold, and through it were passed the sutures that traversed the two lips of the cutaneous incision. As a complete operation for entropion the proceeding fell far short, yet it served to obviate the droop of the upper lid and thus met requirement (g). A resume, then, of the fundamental principles of the modern operation for entropion of the upper lid, the measures devised in accordance with them and their authors would stand something like this: (a) Fixed anchorage for sutures that hold up the flap containing the cilia: the tarsus and the tarso-orbital fascia. Anagnostakis. (b) Support of same from below: transplantation of tissue. Spencer- Watson. (c) Correction of incurvation of tarsus: counter-grooving. Streatfteld. ((/) Replacing of tissue, to atone for shrinkage of conjunctiva, and to restore the angle of the free border: intermarginal grafts. Spencer-Watson, Gayet, and Van Millingen. 1 Klin.

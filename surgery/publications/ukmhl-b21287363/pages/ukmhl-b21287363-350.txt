OPERATIONS UPON THE CONJUNCTIVA. 342 other downward, for a few millimeters from the base of the denuded space on the cornea, the edges of the scleral wound are undermined for some distance by means of the blunt scissors and brought lightly together by very fine silk sutures (Fig. 198). These have been re- cently boiled in vaselin-paraffin. One should see to it that each bite of the thread is deep enough to hold firmly. A carefully applied four-yard wet netting roller is put on. the patient is told to keep very quiet for forty-eight hours, and to re- frain from use of the uncovered eye, also to keep it mostly closed.

The sutures are taken out three or four days from the date of operation. 2. Transplantation of pterygium, in order to divert its growth from the cornea, was originally conceived by the elder Desmarres.1 This surgeon dissected up the growth like a flap, from its base to its apex, then from a convenient point on the lower edge of the con- junctival opening he carried an incision, parallel with the corneal margin, sufficiently far to accommodate the loosened pterygium. Into this, after having been opened into a triangular bared space, he turned the growth and secured it there by sutures (Figs. 199 and 200). The defect remaining about the limbus was left to heal by granulation. When the apex of the pterygium is truncated the 1 Traite theorique et pratique des maladies des yeux, 2e edition, 1855, Paris, t. ii, p. 168.

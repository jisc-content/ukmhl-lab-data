286 ECTROPION*. distance commensurate with the surplus length of the margin. The incision AB, made about at right angles to the tangent of the curve of the upper border, should be somewhat longer than AD. BC is nearly three times and CA twice as long as AB. In undermining, to mobilize the skin and mus- cle, only the side AC is loosened, and to the extent indicated by the dotted line, leaving the other two fixed for supports. In closing, the opening D is sutured to B. A strong point in this sort of operation is that the elongation of the tarsus is Fig. 159.—Dieffenbach, No. 2. definitely disposed of. The third class of operations for this kind of ectropion is composed of the several operations for tarsorrhaphy—or blepharorrhaphy— already described (pp. 220-224) for occlusion of some portion of the palpebral fissure. It may be the external tarsorrhaphy of Fuchs, the internal (German median) of v. Arlt, or the median of Panas. In the writer's opinion, only the latter has a place in modern ocular surgery, and even it is seldom indicated. He would rather trust to one of the other pro- cedures mentioned in connec- tion with this subject or, in ex- treme cases, to a combination of more than one of them. For example, a resection at the outer commissure in conjunction with a Snellen suture, where the ectro- pion is a mixture of the atonic and the mucous types or, if the operation made at the canthus failed to reinstate the punctum, one could resort later to such a procedure as that of Wharton- Jones (Figs. 164-5)—placing the apex of the V directly beneath the punctum, so that the maximum of pushing upward of the lid would be where it would do the most good.

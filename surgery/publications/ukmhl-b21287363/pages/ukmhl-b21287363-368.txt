36o OPERATIONS UPON THE CONJUNCTIVA. treatment. For one thing, it must be particularly seen to that ad- hesions do not form between contiguous portions of the membrane made raw by the operation. To this end, during the first days thereafter, frequent examinations and, mayhap, the use of a probe, are needed to prevent the formation of cavities and pockets. These would only help to obliterate the already shallowed cul-de-sacs. Repetitions of expression are required as long as any lurking follicles can be discovered, always with a wholesome mistrust of the FiG. 208. fornices and the semilunar fold; and appropriate medical treatment is to be continued until the cure is complete. The technic of the process of necessity varies somewhat with the kind of instrument employed, but is mainly such as common sense and a thorough knowledge of the nature of the disease and of the tissues involved would dictate. The principal things to be avoided are undue traumatism of the conjunctiva and injury to the corneal epithelium. The prolonged action of cocain, it must be remembered, is bad for the cornea. Every infiltrated follicle must Fig. 209. be sought out and emptied at the one sitting. After finishing and before replacing the lids, free irrigation of the entire conjunctival surface with hot boric acid or normal salt solution is indispensable. The time for expression is toward the end of the first, or at the beginning of the second, stage of the disease, i.e., when the granules have become soft or "ripe." This condition occurs when the in- filtrated follicles take on a grayish or yellow-gray tint. Then the affected folds and lobules of the fornices are plump but quiet. It is

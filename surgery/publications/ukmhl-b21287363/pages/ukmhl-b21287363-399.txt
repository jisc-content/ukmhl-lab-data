391 ANTERIOR STAPHYLOMA. introduced in the same manner internally. The Beer abscission was then made, the two loops drawn down across the extremities of the wound, and the opposite ends of thread tied. Virtually, the two threads play the role of four vertical sutures. De Wecker,1 modified Knapp's procedure. He first incised the conjunctiva all around the base of the incision, dissected it back somewhat, and put into it a purse-string suture; abscised the corneal ectasis after Beer, and tightened the thread drawing the conjunctiva tightly closed over the opening in die globe. De Wecker, about 1883, wisely con- cluded to make complete exen- teration of the globe before closing the wound. Kuchler,2 of Darmstadt, sim- ply incised the staphyloma hori- zontally, straight through its center, after the manner of his Querschnitt for extraction, re- moved the lens, and allowed the wound to cicatrize. Such is a brief history of the development of the operation of abscission, for total staphyloma of the cornea, a measure that is now, happily, fast becoming obsolete. Ophthalmic surgeons are be- ginning to realize the folly of a procedure that only makes the operated eye a greater menace to its fellow. That is to say, the portion which is admitted to be the source of sympathetic inflam- mation, viz., the uvea, was not only left behind, but left in condition more potent for mischief; that the stump is unsightly without a prothesis, yet that the latter is supported even better after exentera- tion; that there are three objects for removing a total staphyloma â€”to correct a deformity, to prevent sympathetic inflammation, and to make a suitable stump over which to wear an artificial eye. The old method fulfilled only the minor indications. Of course, where both eyes are blind it does not matter. When the eye is highly glaucomatous or that of a subject well along in years, expulsive 'Ann. d'oculist t. xix, 51, 1873. 'Heidelb. med. Ann., vol. vii, 1 84 1.

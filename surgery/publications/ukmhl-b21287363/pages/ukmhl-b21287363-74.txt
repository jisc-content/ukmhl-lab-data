INSTRUMENTS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT. 66 special manipulation because of the peculiar construction of the shank, one should have either all or none of this style. Cystotome.—One is a necessity—two would be almost a luxury. Those in the market are mostly modifications of Von Graefe's. It would be better if they were the original model, for it is a splendidly conceived instrument. The outline of the blade is very suggestive of the side view of a goose's head (Fig. 33) It will be observed that the back of the head of the goose is well rounded, and that the throat, from beak to neck, is a light concavity. Now, what passes in this country as the Graefe cystotome is commonly an ugly, angular affair, something like that shown in Fig. 34, being a mere spike, or peg. The back of the head is a right angle that Fig. 33. Fig. 34 Fig. 35. Fig. 36. catches in the incision and in the iris; and the throat is another angle in which rust and bacteria can accumulate. The idea seems to prevail that only a scratching point is required in a cystotome— that a cutting edge is a superfluity; and, doubtless, many a bungling capsulotomy is the result. A mere point does not cut, it simply tears. The point punctures the anterior capsule, and, unless there is an edge, and a sharp one at that, to make an incision, the alleged capsulotomy is nothing but an indiscriminate laceration. Knapp's cystotome is an example of an incisive one, but it too is objectionable by reason of its angularity. Someone has given to the Graefe cystotome a small cutting extension backward which adds to its efficiency. The author has used for the past ten years a cystotome on the Graefe principle, only the head of the goose is larger, and the trenchant part is prolonged a little way into the neck (Fig. 35)

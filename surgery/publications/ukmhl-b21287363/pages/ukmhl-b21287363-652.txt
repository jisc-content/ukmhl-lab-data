THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. 642 point of crossing of the 'A' or 'B' and the 'C or 'D' lines is found, which gives the location of the foreign body in reference to the front view of the eyeball, indicating its situation above or below the center of the cornea and to the nasal or temporal side of the vertical plane. Where a vertical line from this point crosses the 'E' reading on the horizontal section of the globe it gives the depth of the body in the eyeball or orbit. In bodies of large size both ends should be localized to give the position in which the body rests in the globe. The situation of the body on the side view is determined by transferring its measured depth from the horizontal Fig. 287.â€”Radiograph of foreign body in eye three-fourths actual size. (Sweet.) section and its distance above or below the horizontal plane from the front view localization. "The new apparatus is based upon the same general principles as was the old, but its mechanical features eliminate some of the errors that may occur in the use of the present instrument through carelessness of the operator in making the measurements and transferring them to the chart. The inexperienced worker in eye localization is also relieved of the necessity of studying out the position of the tube and the direction of the lines of shadow at the two exposures. The construction of the new apparatus insures that these factors are positively determined and recorded. The accuracy of the localization depends only upon the care with which the

MEDIAN TARSORRHAPHY. 223 location and marks the extent of the proposed occlusion. The best way is by means of tiny pricks with knife, to cause red points of blood. If the eye has useful vision, the site of the operation is so placed that in looking at distant objects the outer opening is utilized, and at those close up, the inner one. This would make the occluding bridge a trifle to the nasal side of the center, the point that is preferable from an anatomical standpoint also. A lid spatula is placed first in the lower fornix, for when the upper lid is clone first the bleeding interferes with work on the lower. The lid is pressed firmly against the spatula to steady it if no clamp is used, and a thin slice of the margin is re- moved by means of the convex scalpel. I have found the Beard forceps described on page 99 the most convenient instru- ment for steadying the lid during this step. It is ap- plied just as if for making the intermarginal incision for receiving a graft, the screw tightened, and the lid everted. The raw surface prepared need not be more than four or five millimeters long, though this must be regulated by the judgment of the operator. Its width should include only the tarsal partion of the free border, i.e., the adjacent cilia and their follicles are spared. An exactly contiguous spot is pared on the upper margin. Two sutures are passed in through the lower lid and out through the upper, the raw areas put nicely in apposition and the thread tied firmly over a short section of soft-rubber tubing or a cylinder of gauze or cotton. It is best to reinforce the sutures by strips of adhesive plaster. Over all, the usual dressing and bandage. The spring of the rub- ber tubing will take up the slack of the thread caused by any slight tendency to cut out; yet, to make surer, one may tie bow- knots, so that they may be untied, in case of early separation of the lids, and the sutures again drawn up. The thread is removed after four or five days.

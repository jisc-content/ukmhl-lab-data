258 ENTROPION. Anaenostakis latter stitched the lower lip of the skin incision. The upper lip was not included in the sutures. This method failed in all the other requirements save (a). Hotz,1 of Chicago, modified this proceeding by making the primary incision higher up and parallel with the upper tarsal border, to give a normal sulcus with the scar at its bot- tom (Fig. 129). He passed the sutures through the upper lip of the skin incision also before tying, and, most im- portant of all, insisted upon the resection of the lower fibres of the orbicularis—thus partly fulfilling indication (e). To Hotz is really due the credit of perpetuating the principle ad- duced by Anagnostakis, and which is so necessary a part of the advanced entropion operation. Moreover, as regards the incep- tion of the idea, Hotz owes noth- ing to the Greek surgeon. The first to see, and partly to supply, the second want—sup- port from below—as well as the first to make marginal blepharo- plasty, was Spencer-Watson.2 This surgeon, after splitting the lid border as per the old Greek method, made as if to remove the ellipse of skin, but left the outer end attached, as he did also the inner end of the cutan- eous bridge containing the cilia, Fig. 129.—Hotz.

50 EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. iridic angle, if a conjunctival flap is desired, it (the edge) is turned backward to emerge beneath the membrane. I look upon this flap, identified with Desmarres, as one of the keys to the situation, not alone in simple extraction, but in the combined as well. It is not prone to become misplaced, but clings to its original site with singular pertinacity, and heals solidly in a few hours, thus holding the incision closed; and to be held shut favors primary union, absence of iris complications, and many other untoward happenings. It need not be in the way of the subsequent operations, such as delivery of the cataract and cortex and the toilet of the eye, as it is easy enough to turn it over onto the cornea. As for any hemorrhage, that may be occasioned by it, that is not to be considered at all. Just before final closure of the eye it must be seen to that the flap is nicely coapted—not caught in the cut, etc. Could one determine with anything like certainty before operating the dimensions and consistency of the cataract, the size of the flap or of the section might be planned to suit the individual case. Since this is not feasible, it is better to err on the side of prudence and safety, by making it unnecessarily large, than to attempt the regular practice of making it comparatively small. While, of course, on general principles, small wounds are less vicious in every way than large ones, with aseptic precautions and placed in the vascular Fig. 273.—Split at all points.

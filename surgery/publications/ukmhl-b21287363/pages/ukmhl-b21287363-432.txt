OPERATIONS UPON THE GLOBE. 1 Ann. d'ocul., 1888, p. 261. 4^4 To obviate traction upon the iris. Abadie1 devised an ingenious mode for irito-ectomy, by which he obtained a quadrilateral pupil. Two parallel incisions of the cornea, 5 or 6 mm. apart, made with the lance-keratome. the first one smaller, the second larger and made to pierce and incise the iris to form one side of the opening. Fig. 221.—Incisions. Fig. 222.—Result. Introduction of tiny forceps-scissors at the larger, and extending the iris cut in this form (Fig. 221). Withdrawing the flap with iris forceps or hook at the smaller corneal incision, and cutting it off its base (Fig. 222). OPERATIONS FOR SYNECHIA. SYNECHIOTOMY. These operations have for their object: 1. The cure of the defect itself, i.e., the severance of the iris from its attachment. 2. The affording of relief from the effects of the svnechia. The first constitutes true synechiotomy. In the second instance, the breaking up of the adhesions is apt to be but partial and incidental. As the synechia is said to be pos erior or anterior, according as it concerns union of the iris with the crystalline lens or with the cornea, so is the synechiotomy posterior or anterior. Corelysis is the term that distinguishes posterior synechiotomy. Wenzel, of Paris and London, in the latter part of the 18th century, was the first to practise posterior corelysis. He broke the adhesions with a needle introduced by way of the anterior chamber, and the

RESECTION OF THE OUTER WALL OF THE ORBIT. 6oi TEMPORARY RESECTION OF THE OUTER WALL OF THE ORBIT. KRONLEIN'S OPERATION. About twenty years ago, two general surgeons, working inde- pendently of each other, conceived of this operation, whereby the remoter depths of the orbit are made much more accessible than by any former method. These men were Wagner, of Germany, and Kronlein, of Switzerland. Wagner's idea was in connection with fractures and other injuries of the skull, among which were foreign bodies lodged near the apex of the orbit, and Kronlein's was to facilitate the removal of tumors of the orbit, particularly the deep-seated dermoids. To Kronlein is due the credit of having evolved suitable technic, he calling the procedure, Osteo- plastic Resection of the Outer Wall of the Orbit. Kronlein's Operation.â€”The eyebrow and the hair about the temple are shaved and the pa- tient narcotized. The first step of the operation is the incision of the soft parts. This de- scribes an arc on the temple, having its convexity directed forward (Fig. 274). It begins over the semicircular ridge of the frontal bone, above the angular process, and two centimeters above the fronto-malar articulation The topography of the bone here is pronounced, and the different features easily distinguished by feeling. The cut runs downward and forward till about Hush with the outer rim of the orbit, where it begins to turn backward, to be carried along opposite the upper border of the zygomatic arch, near the middle of which it stops. The first portion is through only skin, fascia, and a little into the muscle. The middle and latter portions are down to the bone. Fig. 274.

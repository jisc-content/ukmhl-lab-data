230 OPERATIONS FOR PTOSIS. muscle by means of deep cicatricial bands was first conceived by Dransart.1 The union was accomplished by means of sutures connecting the lid and the superciliary region, and the method has been called deep palpebro-frontal ligature. Dransart employed buried, absorbable sutures (Fig. 101). He made an incision along the upper border of the tarsus, opened wide the wound, particularly above, where he carried the loosening up as far as the supercilia. A needle, armed with catgut, was made to transverse the tarsus, beginning about its middle, passing upward deep into its substance, then through the fibres of the orbicularis to a point just below the supercilia. Here it is turned and passed back through the same structures, alongside its first course, and was brought out on a level with its entrance. Two other sutures were introduced in the same way, parallel with the first, and all three tied. The degree of tightening could be governed by that of the ptosis, but the chief merit of the method was assumed to lie in the three cicatricial bands or cords running from tarsus to frontalis. The skin incision was closed and the buried sutures were left to their fate. H. Pagenstecher2 modified Dransart's procedure (Fig. 102). The operation consisted, merely, in the introduction of two subcutaneous, double-armed sutures, running from near the free border to a point above the supercilia, where they were tied in bowknots over sections of rubber tubing. These were left in place to suppurate, and were gradually tightened or drawn up from time to time, and made to cut 1 Annals d'oculist, vol. lxxxiv, p. 88, 1880. 2 Internat.

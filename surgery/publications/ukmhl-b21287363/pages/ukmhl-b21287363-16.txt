It will be seen that the bottom part of the frame stands out from the lower part of the wearer's face in such a position as to hold the gauze away from it, thereby insuring comfort. "Of the two kinds of masks herein described, the first mentioned has the advantage of being instantly adjusted to the head, whereas the other, even though it may take a trifle longer to put on, is pre- ferred by many on account of its giving the desired protection in a more complete way. It is well to note that where an operating cap is worn with a Tuttle's Mask, only the eyes and their immediate vicinity are left exposed, while the remaining portions of more than the entire front half of head and neck are completely covered. Furthermore, it should be remembered that both types mentioned are so constructed as not to allow the gauze to rest against the face of wearer, thereby enabling him to feel at perfect ease, which is not the case where gauze alone is worn; also that the wire temple bars may be easily bent, so that the masks can be readily adjusted to fit almost anyone."

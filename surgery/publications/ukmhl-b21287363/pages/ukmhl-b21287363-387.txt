CORNEAL CAUTERY. 379 the field of operation. One side of this copper bulb is drawn out into a blunt protuberance for use in the cauterization of compara- tively large surfaces, w hile at another point on the bulb is attached a delicate, short platinum rod for use on small surfaces. The'bulb and point will remain sufficiently hot to cauterize for several minutes after being healed to a cherry red over a flame. To Make the Cautery.—The eye is prepared and anesthetized. The speculum is put in and the globe held by fixation forceps. Having' seen to it that the appa- ratus is in working order, an assistant supports the electrodes while the surgeon applies the tip. Some prefer to lay the cold tip on and heat it in situ. Seeing, however, that the performance should be a mere touch, it would seem that greater precision can be attained by holding the wire close to the place to be burned, heating it to the right color, then deftly making the contact. If the tip is allowed to become white-hot (incandescent) its energy is too great, and besides, the light startles the patient. The touch must be particularly quick as regards the cornea, lest steam be generated in the aqueous. It is much better to make several brief applica- tions than attempt too much with one. Since the year 1873, when Martinache, of San Francisco, first called attention to its virtues in the treatment of ulcers of the cornea,1 Fig. 215.—Wordsworth-Todd cautery. the cautery has come to be a standard remedy for all such infectious diseases as serpent, fascicular, annular, dendritic and rodent ulcers, ulcerated wounds, and the ulceration incident to purulent ophthalmia. In addition to the rules governing the general method of ocular cautery just given, there are a few points relating to corneal cautery 1 Pacific Med. and Sur. Journal, Nov., 1873, p. 294. Fig. 214.

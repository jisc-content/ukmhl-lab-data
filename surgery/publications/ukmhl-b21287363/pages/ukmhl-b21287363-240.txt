232 OPERATIONS FOR PTOSIS. corresponding length in the middle of the shaved supercilia. Two sutures of fine gold or silver wire, each armed with two needles, are introduced at the bottom of the marginal incision, carried up under the orbicularis to emerge from beneath the upper lip of the brow incision, so as to include the frontalis. The tracts of each pair of needles are six to eight millimeters apart. The lid having been drawn up sufficiently, the sutures are tied. The cut in the eyebrow is closed with fine silk sutures; that in the border is left to close of itself. Objections that have been offered to this procedure are liability of the wire, after a time, to break or to be expelled, and injury to the hair follicles of the cilia. To obviate these features, Bishop,1 of Cambridge, proposed substituting for the wire a fine wove-chain of gold. A single strand of this is threaded into a four-inch abdomi- nal needle. No incision is made (Fig. 106). The needle is first in- serted above the supercilia, a little to the nasal side, passed down beneath the orbicularis, close to the tarso-orbital fascia and tarsus, brought out near the cilia, reinserted at the point of exit, carried horizontally along near the free border, brought out external to the median line, reinserted, passed upward, parallel with its downward course, to emerge on a level with the point of first entrance. After drawing up the lid the requisite degree, the needle is put deep into the frontalis where it came out last, plowed horizontally along, and finally brought out where it first entered. The ends are cut off and buried beneath the skin.

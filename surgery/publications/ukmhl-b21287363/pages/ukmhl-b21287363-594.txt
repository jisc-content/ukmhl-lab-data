586 EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. extractions he had a loss by panophthalmitis of but 5%. About this time, Graefe's colleague, Jacobson, came to the front with his conception of the flap extraction. This consisted in a downward section, situated one-half millimeter behind the conjunctival limbus or in the opaque cornea, and included just one-half of the corneal base (Fig. 256), and was combined with an enormous iridectomy. Through the efforts of these two surgeons, ere the dawn of antisepsis, the occurrence of suppuration, after cataract extraction, was reduced to at least one-half what it had formerly been Following close upon Graefe, Jacobson, Bowman, and Critchett came De Wecker, of Paris, about 1869, offering his combined oper- ation. Its feature was an upward corneal flap, two to three milli- Fig. 256. Jacobson, 1864. Fig. 257. De Wecker, il Fig. 258. De Wecker, 1875. meters high, made by an incision beginning in the sclera, on either side, and ending in the limbus, thus having scleral ends—"Extrac- tion combinee a petit lambeau." The length of De Wecker's incision was 11 millimeters, whereas v. Graefe's linear was 10 millimeters (see Fig. 257). This he afterward (1875) altered to his two milli- meters high, purely corneal flap, exactly in the upper limbus, and including just 1/3 of the corneal circumference " detachment of the superior third of the cornea"—and, most important, returning to the method of Daviel in that he omitted the iridectomy—"Extraction simple a petit lambeau''' (Fig. 258). For the fashioning of his section De Wecker used a knife modeled after that of v. Graefe, though hardly more than half the width, and gradually increasing in thickness, at the back, from point to heel, until at the shank it was one millimeter through. Something the

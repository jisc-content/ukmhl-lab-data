INSTRUMENTS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT. n6 Fig 46.—Fiddle-bow of the procedure as it occurs in the body of this book. For the rest, the reader must look to other sources. A word, however, as to the "fiddle-bow" method of holding the scalpel, as shown in cut (Fig. 46). The name, while a little more appropriate than that of "penholder" to the grasp in point, only describes it in part. For here the index is usually placed on the upper side of the handle, near the end that carries the blade. The pulps of the second and third fingers are placed side by side about midway of the handle, on one side, and the thumb on the other side, just opposite. The little finger is best left free. This mode is specially conformable to incisions that are made from left to right, as regards the operator, or from right to left when executed with the left hand. The handling of instruments other than those with handles is also treated of further on, where occasion demands. The method of holding the scissors is given elsewhere in this chapter. A word here as to turning them over while in the hand. This is a maneuver that is in frequent requisition with curved scissors. The index is removed from its position with tip resting on the pivot, and dropped back to place it opposite the medius. These two serve then to hold the scissors, while the third finger and thumb are removed from the rings. This is done in the order named, and the third finger, on emerging, gives the ring that it just left a push to turn it in the direction of the thumb; this, in turn, on coming out, pushes the other ring toward the third finger, and the Fig. 47.—Manner of holding keratome.

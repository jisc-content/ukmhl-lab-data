PARA-OPERATIVE TECHNIC. 46 heat from the rubber or the electric coil may be made moist, plain or antiseptic, by keeping the wrapping of the coil wet with the ap- propriate liquid. Cold finds its chief indication in severe, acute inflammations of the conjunctiva, and immediately following injuries of the eye or its appendages. Like heat, it is applied dry or moist. Dry cold is most often from cracked ice, in a rubber bag, laid on the closed lids. A good plan is to syphon ice-water through a very small rubber tube from a large vessel, placed just a little higher Fig. 29. Fig. 30. Leiter's coils of soft rubber tubing for dry or moist heat or cold. than the patient's head through a coil laid on the eye, thence, through a still smaller tube to another vessel (Figs. 29 and 30). This has been called mediate irrigation, and may be either dry or moist. Leiter's lead coils are too heavy for use upon the eye. Moist cold is best transferred to the eye by bits of old, heavy table-linen. This is more absorbent than new linen. One need hardly say the linen must be aseptic. Pads two to two and one-half inches square, and composed of several thicknesses, are wrung out of ice-water and laid on the lids. A more conven'ent way is to put a large block of ice into a pan or basin and lay six or eight of the linen

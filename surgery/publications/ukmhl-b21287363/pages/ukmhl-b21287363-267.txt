Gayet1 split the free border and dissected up the long strip of skin, with external pedicle, which he transplanted back of the cilia without sliding up /'fjfflji?' the skin containing them, thus partly meeting recpuirement (</) —or restoration of atrophied tissue (Figs. 131 and 132). A further improvement was that made by Dianoux2 who, in addition to the bridge con- taining the lashes, formed a second of integument, above and adjacent to the first. The two were then transposed and sutured. Both were fed by double pedicles, and as soon as practica- ble those of the intermarginal strip were cut (Figs. 133 and 134). Waldhauer3 made the Jasche-Arlt operation, and rather than throw away the excised segment of skin, he covered with it the denuded lower portion of the tarsus— graft without a pedicle, after Le Fort-Wolfe. Van Millingen,4 of Con- stantinople, under the name of tarso-chiloplasty, still further improved the methods in epiestion by substituting for the intermarginal skin graft one of mucous membrane taken from the inner lining of the lip. A broad strip of this tissue furnishes the requirements mentioned under both (b) and (</). 2 Annal. d'oculist, No. 2, p. 132, 1882. 4 Oph. Review, p. 300, 1887. Fig. 131.—Gayet's entropion operation.

l8o OPERATIONS UPON THE EXTRINSIC MUSCLES. This last is of No. i braided black silk, boiled in equal parts of paraffin and vaselin, and is double-armedâ€”i.e., has a needle at each end. The needles are as fine as will barely carry the thread, and are straight two-thirds of the way from eye to point, from thence slightly curved. As a necessary precaution, the needles should be tested to see that they are quite sharp, and their points be examined under a magnifying glass to make sure that they are without flaws. Fig. 75. Both needles are passed downward through the tendon (see Fig. 74), at a distance from its insertion proportionate to the degree of effect desired, one near the upper, the other near the lower border, and the loop or stitch thus formed is drawn down snugly upon the tendon. Then, taking the upper needle in the holder, the con- junctiva and anterior capsule are lifted by the forceps, and the needle passed beneath these membranes without entering them, carried well forward, then plunged into the episcleral and super- ficially into the scleral tissues, and plowed along until a point is

This consisted in pinching up a vertical fold of skin on the bridge of the nose sufficient to rid the canthi of the redundance, marking out the base of the fold in ink, excising it, inserting silver pins, as in the operation for harelip, and closing the opening by means of thread wound on to the pins, figure-8 fashion.

615 EXENTERATION OF THE ORBIT. skin of this area was dissected up to the pedicle, and turned over the nose, to be stitched back in place after the enucleation. The writer, in the case of a young woman with recurrence of sarcoma in the region of the lacrimal gland, after enucleation and partial exenteration had been resorted to in vain, was enabled to save the lids and the conjunctival sac. The incision extended from about 2 centimeters below the outer canthus around the upper rim, to end in the median line of the nose. The flap thus outlined was dissected up without injuring the conjunctiva, the exenteration made and the flap returned. When the lids are conserved, there is gen- erally an unseemly gaping of the palpebral fissure. To obviate this, Kuster recommends tarsorrhaphy of all save the inner angle. Jn such cases, the writer would suggest thorough resection of the tarsi, and the preservation of the follicles of the cilia. Knapp says that exenteration sometimes saves or prolongs life, and sometimes shortens it. And Panas, "Unfortunately, recidiva- tions are always to be feared, and, in cases of sarcoma, especially glioma, the tumor is reproduced with desperate tenacity, and all the more quickly in proportion as the interventions are repeated."

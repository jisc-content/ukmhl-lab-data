This is particularly necessary in cases of elderly subjects and in those afflicted with chronic inflammations of the conjunctiva, and whose cul-de-sacs are, in a measure, obliterated from atrophy. It is also highly advisable, before actually putting the growth in its new place beneath the conjunctiva, to take it by its head with the forceps, pull it clown and note and mark the place- where it fits best. The younger Desmarres,1 for large pterygia with trun- cated apices, divided them in two and transplanted similar to Knapp, but, like Desmarres the elder, he left the scleral defect uncovered. Galezowski,2 after mobiliz- ing the pterygium, put a double-armed suture through the apex, tucked the growth back beneath the semilunar fold, or the caruncle, where he brought the suture out and tied it. 3. Ligation.—In connec- tion with the surgery of ptery- gium, this measure, though still occasionally resorted to, may be considered obsolete. Its origin is associated with the name of Szokalski.^ This operator passed two curved needles beneath the pterygium, one near the apex, the other near the base, both being attached to the same thread (Fig. 205). The thread was then cut close to the needles. In this manner three ligatures were made, two single and one (the middle) double. The single ones were tightly knotted. The third, formed by the loop of thread, served to detach and lift up the pterygium.

This led to the conclusion that the oily nature of the epidermis was a hin- drance to proper lubrication, hence the ulcer. The piece was excised, a graft from the lip substituted, and at once the ulcer healed.

But a short while and all unsi^htliness disappears. A serious and not infrequent sequel of operations for cicatricial entropion from trachoma is ulceration of the cornea. This occurs even in cases that had previously escaped this complication. More- over, these ulcers are apt to be centrally located, just where they can do most harm to the vision, and heal least readily.

HISTORICAL. 589 more ingenious than practicable. His incision was similar to v. Graefe's, but longer by three millimeters. Lebrun's1 Incision.—Under the name, "Extraction with a small median flap," Lebrun, of Brussells, contrived a purely corneal incision. With a medium-sized Graefe knife, edge directed upward and slightly forward, he made puncture and counterpuncture slightly below the horizontal meridian, exactly in the limbus. The cut extended up, with a light forward curve, and ended at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the vertical meridian of the cornea, or about on a level with the upper border of the average pupil (Fig. 263). Warlomont called this the Belgian Method. De Fig. 263.—Lebrun, 1872. Fig. 264.—Von Arlt, 1874. Fig. 265.—Horner, 1S84. In scleral tissue. Wecker added that, in point of prudence, it might better be termed the neuter method. The graver faults of these sections, lying well within the trans- parent cornea, are want of coaptation, contact with the pupillary border of the iris while the anterior chamber is empty, causing the iris to become entangled, slow healing, from being far from the blood supply (liability to infection), and high degrees of astigmatism in cicatrization. One of the very complications that it was the aim of such sections to obviate was, if anything, yet more frequent, viz., picking up of the iris by the incision. This fact helped to disprove the old rule that the nearer the incision to the sclera, the more urgent an iridectomy. 1 Lebrun.

270 ENTROPION. Rinse it in 1% salt or 4% boric acid solution at about 110° F., and place it flatwise in the cut back of the cilia, making sure that the epithelial surface is outward. The tips of tiny spindle-shaped cotton sponges are well wrung out of boric solution and applied about the edges of the graft, to drink up the slight oozing, the lid being all the time held everted as directed for making the mar- ginal cut. The graft must be ample in exactly the same proportion as fibrin, there is no possibility of the graft letting go, except, possi- bly, in removing the dressing (Fig. 142). The latter consists, first, in the usual, thin layer of cotton wet with warm, boric acid solution, carefully applied to the closed lids (p. 15). There is a little point of considerable value that might be mentioned in this connection; after every other operation treated of in this volume, except the one now under discussion, the ap- plication of the first wet sheet of cotton is made by sliding it on to the lids from above, in order to smooth the lashes downward (see dressing after "Extraction"). In this instance the reverse obtains, viz., it is slid upward, for the reason that the primary effect of this is the intermarginal incision. If the first piece excised falls short of filling the cut, it is better to take a second, sufficiently large, to piece out, squaring and butting together their ends. Fig. 142.—Shows completed operation. No decided hemorrhage should be taking place from the wound when the graft is laid in, else a clot will form beneath and inter- fere with proper union. But a slight bleeding, which is always checked by laying in the graft, is an advantage in that it helps to fix and to hold the morsel in position. Sutures would be both useless and harmful, as when quickly put in (i.e., not fussed with too much) and stuck by

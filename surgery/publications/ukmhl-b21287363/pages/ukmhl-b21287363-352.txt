OPERATIONS UPON THE CONJUNCTIVA. 344 a curved direction into the upper and lower fornices. The whole is then loosened from the eye in the form of a triangular flap which is split horizontally into two equal portions. The part representing the gray infiltrated head is cut off. The tip of each half is stitched into the corresponding angle formed by the upward and down- ward prolongations into the fornices. To cover the remaining defect, two vertical incisions are made in the conjunctiva, beginning at the limbus, extending up and down for several millimeters, getting further from the cornea as they advance. Thus two squarish Fig. 201.—Desmarres, jr.-Knapp. Fig. 202.—Desmarres, jr.-Knapp. flaps are outlined which are undermined and joined together by two sutures. The better to fix the various flaps and to keep them from overriding the cornea, the suture furthest from the cornea is made to include the conjunctiva at the apex of the angle between the two halves of the divided pterygium (Figs. 201 and 202). Both eyes are bandaged for twenty-four hours—afterward only the operated eye—though the patient is advised to use the uncovered eye as little as possible the first week. The threads are removed in five or six days. Both this and Desmarres' are true transplanta- tion, operations.

OPERATIONS UPON THE EXTRINSIC MUSCLES. 176 and the bunching of the tendon into a cone, seeing that the traction was all from a single point, after a number of years, caused the author of the measure to very materially change and improve the method (Fig. 71). The pulley thread was omitted, and what had been the second stage of the operation, i.e., the exposing and picking up of the tendon, became the first. The double-armed thread was put into the tendon as before, whereupon one of the needles was made to traverse the tissue alongside the cornea, as had the old pulley needle, all that was left to do being to knot and draw the thread until the desired turning of the globe was achieved. Verhoeff,1 of Boston, has devised a one-suture mode similar, in most respects, to that of Prince, but with one essential difference. This has reference to the fastening of the tendon to the sclera. In the Prince operation the pull of the two threads is straight toward the cut end of the tendon, whereas, in that of Verhoeff, the greater portion of the tendon's width is tied down tightly to the underlying tissue- strapped down, as it were (Fig. 72). The procedure is thus described: A vertical incision is made in the conjunctiva, about 3 1/2 mm. from the cornea, and that membrane undermined up to the limbus. The tendon is exposed, lifted and held with the Prince advancement forceps. The flap of conjunctiva next to the cornea is retracted, one needle of a double-armed fine thread is passed, vertically, for a distance of 6 to 8 mm. through the episcleral tissue, one mm. from the cornea. At its point of exit the needle is again plowed for a short distance horizontally toward the tendon. The lower needle is 1 Oph. Record, iqoi. Fig. 71.—Prince's second operation.

JOINING THE TARSUS WITH THE SUPERIOR RECTUS. 239 closed by three double-armed sutures. One needle is passed horizontally through the tarso-orbital fascia, then both needles are passed downward, through the remnant of tarsus, and brought out at its free border, behind the lashes, where the suture is knotted. Thus the lips of the tarsal wound are brought into apposition, and the lashes are given a horizontal direction. The skin opening needs no sutures. 3. Joining the Tarsus with the Superior Rectus.—In cases of ptosis not complicated with paralysis of the superior rectus, the late Dr. Parinaud1 (Fig. 116), after having everted the upper lid, made a horizontal incision one and onedialf centimeters long, in- cluding the conjunctiva, and the upper border of the tarsus at its middle; seized the conjunctiva with fixation forceps near the upper corneal limbus, and rotated the globe far downward; opened up the conjunctival incision, and exposed the tendon of the rectus, raised it with forceps, passed a double-armed suture beneath it, including its aponeurosis. Then each of the needles was passed upward, through the adjacent conjunctiva, thence through the levator tendon, down- ward between tarsus and skin, and brought out, seven millimeters apart, at the free border. They were here tied over some soft substance, and taken out after four to six days. Motais,2 of Angers, has given an ingenious and highly approved ptosis operation, which embodies the Parinaud principle:—a 'Ann d'oc, 1897, t. cxvii, p. 12. 2Bull. et mem. de la soc, d'opht, de Paris, Nov., 1898.

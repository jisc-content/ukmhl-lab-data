ADVANCEMENT, OR SHORTENING THE LEVATOR. 237 tendon, a small, double-armed thread is entered into each side of the fold, carried downward between tarsus and orbicularis, and the needles brought out two or three millimeters apart at the free border. Two other sutures are similarly placed, one at either side. The primary incision is sutured and, lastly, the three pairs of thread ends, projecting from the edge of the lid, are tied over small sections of rubber tubing. Both eyes are bandaged. Snellen,1 of Utrecht, is credited with at least two methods to shorten the levator tendon: 1. By Resection.—After exposing the fascia in the usual way, by an incision parallel with the upper lid border, a cut was made transversely through it (Fig. 113). Two or three catgut sutures were passed through the upper edge of the tarsus from the front; the cut end of the tendon was lifted, the sutures passed through it, high up, from the back, a portion was resected commensurate with the amount of shortening desired, the threads were tied and the skin wound closed. Fuchs makes a resection somewhat similar to the above. 2. By tucking without any incision, either of the skin or of the conjunctiva,2 by means of burrowing sutures (Fig. 114). At the center of the insertion of the levator a thread is made to pass through skin, tarsus, and conjunctiva. Then, with the lid everted, it is carried upward between the conjunctiva and the fascia, again brought out through the skin, the latter is lifted, the needle inserted at about the same point whence it has just emerged, passed down beneath the integument, and brought out where it first penetrated. Two others are thus inserted, one on either side of the first, and their 1 Report of the German Oph. Society at Heidelberg, 1883. 2 Trans. Oph. Society of the United Kingdom. Oph.

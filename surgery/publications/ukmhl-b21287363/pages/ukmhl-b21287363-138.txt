130 OPERATIONS UPON THE APPENDAGES OF THE EYE. had made for the staff of the Illinois Charitable Eye and Ear In- firmary, as well as for our private use. The cylinder is of glass with fenestrated metal casting of nickeled brass. The advantages of a cylinder that enables one to see its contents are obvious. The piston-head is packed with asbestos or rubber to admit of boiling, and is made to fit tight or loose by turning the handle. The canulas are made to shove, not to screw on and are of three forms. One, conic, for forcing melted paraffin or other liquid, as emulsion of plaster of Paris or starch, into the sac to facilitate extirpation. One, large silver canula for use after the canaliculus has been slit, the invention of the late H. O. Tansley, of New York. This has Fig. S3- a blind tip, but its sides are perforated with a number of tiny open- ings for a distance of one and a half to two centimeters therefrom. Lastly, two small silver ones for the unopened canaliculus, of equal diameter, but different as to length. The tips of all are made smooth and rounding. The rings of the old model are left off both barrel and piston and, instead, the head is made projecting or flange- like, to afford a finger purchase and of hexagonal or octagonal shape to prevent rolling when laid down, while the handle is in the form of a button. The glass cylinder is fitted at either end with a soft- rubber washer held tightly by screwing down the heads of the metal casing. The Tansley canula is a most valuable adjunct in cases where Bowman's incision has been made, as it performs the office of a probe as well as that of a catheter. By its closed tip the injected liquid is made to wash or bathe the sides or lining of the canal, instead of being shot straight through into the nasal cavity. Having been once introduced, it may be left in position while the syringe is disconnected and refilled as many times as are desirable

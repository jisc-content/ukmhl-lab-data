OPERATIONS UPON THE GLOBE. 47° blood-vessels lie more to the nasal side there is less risk of excessive hemorrhage by choosing this way. It is not advisable to rotate the globe strongly to bring the nerve nearer to the scissors in severing it, as this is apt to result in mangling the bottom of the eye-socket, in oblique section of the nerve, and in greater wounding of blood- vessels, with unnecessary bleeding. I have never felt the need of any instrument other than the medium-sized curved blunt scissors for this step in the operation. The bifid spoon of the elder Terson (Plate VDI) and the hemostatic clamp attachment for the scissors of Warlomont (Fig. 233) sometimes employed in this connection having always struck me as a useless augmentation of an already adequate apparatus; therefore, subversive of the wholesome rule Fig. 233.—Warlomont's hemostatic scissors. that the fewer the instruments the better — always provided the results are in no way prejudiced by too scant an equipment. If there be a tumor of the posterior hemisphere or one that fills the vitreous chamber, it is best to remove as much of the opticus as is practicable. The same is true of cases wherein signs of impending sympathetic ophthalmia are present in the fellow eye. Knapp is the author of a convenient and efficient mode of making this re- section. Before cutting the nerve he passes behind the globe the closed blades of a delicate pair of hemostatic forceps, curved on the flatj feels for and seizes the nerve a few mm. behind the eye, and locks the ' handles. He then introduces the scissors and severs between the point of fixation and the optic entrance. After the bleeding has ceased, the nerve is drawn forward by the still adhe-

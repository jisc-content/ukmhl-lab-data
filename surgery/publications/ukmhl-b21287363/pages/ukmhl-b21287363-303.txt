ECTROPION AND BLEPITAROPLASTY. 295 side, it were left to form the margin of an extensive granulating surface. Harlan's operation was for an epithelioma involving the entire lower lid. Three years afterward, "the canthus was in normal position and the deformity was slight." A pure specimen of the sliding-fiap operation is that devised by Knapp,1 and made for the repair of a lower lid whose inner Fig. 173. —Knapp. two-thirds were sacrificed in the removal of a chancroid. Flaps were constructed as per the lines in Fig. 173. After excision of the section containing the ulcer, the two flaps, having been dissected loose from free end to base, were butted together and sutured. The result was excellent. As a good illustration of a totally wrong principle in a sliding-fiap operation, I would cite the method of -Burow.2 Here the triangle c t Fig. 174.—Burow. of skin, aed (Fig. 174), is excised and thrown away, in order that, in the mobilized integument, d may slide to <7 and a to b and close the openings. There is no chance of supplying suitable borrowed tissue for the secondary defect. In other words, the loss of tissue contiguous to the eye is exactly doubled. Much more rational is 1 Archiv. f.

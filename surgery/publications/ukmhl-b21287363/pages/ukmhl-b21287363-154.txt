OPERATIONS UPON THE APPENDAGES OF THE EYE. 146 point, by means of one of the powerful injectors made for that purpose (Figs. 58 and 59). One of the good points mentioned by Czermak in this connection is the occlusion of the lids during the operation in purulent cases with strips of adhesive plaster. He reasons thus: through the action of the retractors in holding open the wound, the palpebral fissure gapes, the corneal epithelium dries and exfoliates or cracks, and discharge from the puncta coming in contact with it might result in serious infection. This, of course, would prevent the use of probes passed into the sac as guides. Anatomical Notes.—The inferior nasal quadrant of the orbital rim is formed by a sharp ridge on the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. Midway of this ridge is a prominent convexity which is the anterior lacrimal crest. Immediately behind this is the lacrimal groove or that portion of the lacrimal fossa belonging to the supe- rior maxilla. The other, or posterior part of the fossa, is formed from the delicate lacrimal bone, and is bounded at the back by a slight ridge—the Fig. 59.—Beck-Mueller paraffin posterior lacrimal crest. The fossa injector. en(jg ^t\ow m a short, round bony canal, leading to the inferior meatus of the nose. Fossa and canal lodge, respectively, the lacrimal sac and the nasal duct (see Fig. 60). A sharp oval is marked on the drawing to show the place of attachment of the anterior branch of the tendo oculi, or internal canthal ligament. This branch is bifid, one prong for each tarsus. Back of this, with only thin fascia intervening, is the upper extremity, or cupola of the lacrimal sac (see Fig. 61), behind which, likewise, is the posterior branch of the tendo oculi, and behind that is the muscle of Horner. The last two are attached to the posterior lacrimal crest. Separating this whole mechanism from the deeper structures of the orbit is a

ECTROPION AND BLEPHAROPLASTY. 317 Thiersch (or Wolfe) graft. The lid graft is anchored by sutures to the strip of skin at the free border of the tarsus (upper lid) or to the tarso-orbital fascia beneath the tarsus (lower lid). The second division of the bared space is then covered by an unsutured graft. Before implanting the grafts, two strong silk threads are put through the edge of the reposited lid, it is made to widely overlap its fellow, and the threads are fastened to the cheek (or brow) by collodionized cotton or gauze. By thus fixing the edges of the lid graft to firm supports, both its shrinkage upon itself and its traction upon the free border are counteracted. Moreover, by this arrange- ment, the contraction of the ultratarsal graft is not so directly transmitted to the tarsal one. Fig 190.—Hotz. Fig. 191.—Hotz. In some instances, Hotz, instead of transplanting a graft to cover the tarsal portion, utilizes the cicatricial skin already overly- ing it, which he dissects up in the form of a semilunar flap that is left adherent along the lid margin. The bands of scar are divided, the lid is turned into position, drawn over its fellow, and fixed by ligatures and collodion as just described. If it be the upper lid, the free border of the flap is stitched to the upper border of the tarsus; if the lower, to the tarso-orbital fascia and the remain- ing wound surface is covered by a Thiersch graft into which no

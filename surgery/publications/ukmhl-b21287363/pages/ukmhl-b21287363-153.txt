PREPARATION. 145 the material should be dissected out. The patient should be prone upon his back and all ready for the operation of extirpation. The inferior nasal meatus is tamponed with vaselined cotton to prevent blood or other fluid from entering the nose, throat, and larynx. All pus or other lluid is first thoroughly expressed from the sac and canaliculi, the cavity washed out and the liquid again expressed. If paraffin is put in, it is then hardened by applying crushed ice or Fig. 58.â€”Broeckaert paraffin injector. a cooling spray, as of chlorid of ethyl, to the overlying skin. If plaster, a few minutes is given for it to set. This throwing in of a hardening substance serves to make a mould not only of the sac, but also of the canaliculi, and does away with the need of inserting probes for purposes of orientation. Probably a less uncertain method of filling the sac, and one as well calculated to facilitate the extirpation, is that of Jocqs, of Paris, which consists in making a small opening in the anterior wall as soon as the sac is reached and packing the entire organ with absorbent cotton. Another feasible plan is to Jill the sac with cold paraffin, of relatively low melting- 10

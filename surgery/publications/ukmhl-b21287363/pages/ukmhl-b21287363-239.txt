OPERATIONS FOR PTOSIS. 231 their way out. No incision was made, the originator relying for his result upon the effect obtained by the cicatricial tracts uniting lid and frontalis caused by the sutures cutting through the tissues. De Wecker1 went still further, and modified this operation by removing a long oval of the skin and underlying muscle, whose lower edge was four or five millimeters from the free border. (Fig. 103.) For the rest, he proceeded as did Pagenstecher. Hess2 modified the Pagenstecher-De Wecker procedures thus: Incision the whole length of the previously shaved supercilia, through skin and subcutaneous connective tissue (Fig. 104). Dis- section downward, between integument and orbicularis, to near the ciliary border. Insertion of three double-armed sutures about mid- way of the loosened flap, which are carried up beneath the skin, brought out at a point on the brow two centimeters above the primary incision, and knotted over sections of drain tube. The upper half of the flap is by this means thrown into a horizontal fold, the size or height of which corresponds to the degree of effect, the loops of thread causing a depression that simulates the normal sulcus. The sutures are removed at the end of the tenth day. It would seem that this measure is likely to produce rather undue shortening of the lid. A phase of the Dransart method is that of Mules-' (Fig. 105). In- stead of silk or catgut sutures he employs gold or silver wire, which is put in after the following manner: Incision along the free border of the lid, as if for intermarginal graft, though not so deep.

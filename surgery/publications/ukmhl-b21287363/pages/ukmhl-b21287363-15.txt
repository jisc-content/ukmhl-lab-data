7 OPERATING MASKS. tying the gauze at the back of the head. This and other objections to wearing some sort of shield have been done away with by such wire masks as we illustrate; these may be easily attached to the head in a manner similar to spectacles, requiring only the handling of the mask itself, which should be previously sterilized. Wilson, of Bridgeport, has attachments on the mounting of his operating spectacles for holding the gauze mask. "()ne of the two best-known patterns of these wire masks is that of Mikulicz, which consists of a wire framework so made that Fig. r.—Mikulicz mask. Fig. 2.—Mikulicz mask. when covered with two thicknesses of gauze stitched to all sides, it effectually covers the nose and mouth of the wearer when it is placed in position. It is instantly adjusted to the head, and when not in use a number of them may be nested and temple bars folded over, so as to take up a minimum amount of room. "The other pattern now being rapidly adopted by many leading surgeons and hospitals, as fulfilling the purpose admirably, is known as Tuttle's mask. This is a modification, by Dr. Edward C. Tuttle, of a somewhat similar contrivance used in some European hospitals; and while they are also made of wire, they are different in construction to those first described, as will be seen by comparing the illustrations shown herewith. On these frames the gauze is to be attached only to the upper part, but for the entire length of same, back to the very ends of the temple bars, so as to allow the gauze, after the mask has been put on, to hang down 16 to 18 inches

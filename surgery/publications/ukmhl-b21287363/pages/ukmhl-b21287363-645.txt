635 METHOD OF SWEET. been measured, its distance is indicated on the line drawn from K through the center ball A. A line through J to this point indicates the divergence of the rays. This means of determining the position of the plane of shadow of the foreign body is more accurate than when the measurement is made of the shadow of the body above each of the balls, and should be followed especially if the body is some distance away from the anterior segment of the globe or is in the orbit. Fig. 281.â€”Diagram of position of foreign body in eyeball. (Hansell ond Sweet.) If the foreign body has passed into the orbit, the rotation of the eyeball to insure parallelism of the ocular axis with the plane of the plate leads to a slight error in the determination of the position of the metal. To eliminate this error necessitates a knowledge of the angle of the orbit with the plate or, its ecpjivalent, the amount of deviation of the eyeball from the primary position and the con- sideration of this angle in plotting the diagrammatic circles representing the eyeball.

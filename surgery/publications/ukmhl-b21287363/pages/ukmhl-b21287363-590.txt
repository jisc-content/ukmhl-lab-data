582 EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. (Fig. 251), and later, Santerelli, in 1795, sought to renew the linear extraction, though their efforts were not strongly seconded (Fig. 252 ). This was the form as instituted by Saint-Yves and Petit, the fathers of extraction, and, as if to mark the centenary of their discovery, a revival of linear extraction was inaugurated by Gibson, of Lon- don, in 1811, and by Friederick Jaeger, of Vienna, in 1812. Indeed, it was the latter who gave the operation the designation, linear. This movement had its culmination in Great Britain, having been given great impetus by Travers (1814) and Burton, of London (about 1820). The former was especially instrumental in forward- ing it, and the fruits of his activity are visible in the latest phase of the operation. He strove for a minimum incision, and for a Fig. 251.—Pelluci, 1752.

He first limited his form of extraction to soft cataracts. With a reclination needle, he dislocated the lens into the anterior chamber, then extracted it through a small linear corneal incision. Traver's wound was made above and included just 1 \\ of the corneal margin, hence it became known as Traver's Quarter Section (Fig. 2 53). Later he applied this kind to extraction in general, not limiting it to certain soft cataracts, and those that had been previously broken up as by discission, using a sort of thin spoon to deliver the lens. In after years Sir William Bowman and the elder Critchett, of London (1864), reverted to the Travers' operation, though they extended, with scissors, the incision begun with the keratome, so as to in- clude 1/3 or more of the corneal base, added an iridectomy, and

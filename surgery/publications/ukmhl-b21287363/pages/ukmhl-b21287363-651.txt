A reading is made of the line or lines which pass through the body, and this is transferred to the corresponding lines of the 'C or 'D' scale of the chart, to the right or left side, depending on which eye is under examination. Without moving the plate the 'E' reading is similarly made and transferred to the chart.

The line or lines of the 'A' or 'B' coordinates which cross the shadow of the body are noted and indicated on the 'A' or 'B' lines of the chart. The hori- zontal coordinate 'E' should be the same in both readings. If the focus point on the anode of the tube was accurately set by the cross-lines on the lead-glass shield of the tube-holder, the images of the indicating ball on the plate will coincide simultaneously with those on the transparent key-plate, and it will then not be neces- sary to reset the plate to read the position of the 'A' and 'B' coordinates.

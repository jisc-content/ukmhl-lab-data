148 OPERATIONS UPON THE APPENDAGES OF THE EYE. the orbit (Fig. 63). In case the subject is one of those in whom the sac is not deeply situated a shorter incision would suffice, but there is no drawback to one of the length here specified, and the task is perceptibly lightened by having a generous opening. So situ- ated, the incision avoids the larger blood-vessels—i.e., the branches of the facial artery and vein called angular—and the scar is least conspicuous. The tissues are deliberately divided, layer by layer, first the skin, second superficial fascia, third orbicularis, and fourth Fig. 61.—1, Anterior branch of tenclo oculi. 2, Lacrimal sac. 3, Posterior branch of tendo oculi. 4, Horn3r's muscle. 5, Septum orbitale. the deeper fascia, so as to come with discrimination down onto the anterior wall of the sac, and keeping all the while close in behind the anterior lacrimal crest. Caution is required in dividing the last layer or the sac may be opened. Diligent sponging is kept up and the lips of the deepening and broading wound are held well apart by squint-hooks or Desmarre's retractors, or if an assistant is not available, by Miiller or Eversbusch speculum (Fig. 64). Second step.—When the smooth, red membrane composing the offending organ is exposed, blunt dissection or very careful cutting

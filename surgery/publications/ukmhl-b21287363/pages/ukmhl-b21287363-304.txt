The Indian Method.—In the ancient days of India there was endless strife between the black races, with their ugly flat noses, and the lighter Aryan invaders, with their boasted nasal prominence and beauty. Hence, the nasal feature soon became the target, not only for ridicule and scorn, but for actual violence—legal and otherwise. Hence also the Hindu surgeons were early in devising means for the restoration of the mutilated organ. Among their methods was that of building up the lost portions of the nose by transplanting pedunculated flaps of skin from the adjoining cheek. When the same was applied to the plastic surgery of the lids, it was referred to as the Indian method. Blepharoplasty was not practiced to any ex- tent, however, until the third decade of the nineteenth century, and almost all the earlier attempts were after the Indian method—that is, by rotation of pedunculated flaps, taken from the nearby skin, with more or less twisting of their pedicles. The first to claim having successfully restored a lid in this way was Carl Ferdinand Graefe.1 In 1818, this surgeon, after several years in trials of various means, reported some of his experiences. Among them was the building up of the lids by both this and the Italian methods. In the same article (p. 19) it is stated that Dzondi had essayed the renewal of the lower lid by a flap taken from the cheek, but had failed. Fig. 175.

598 CHAPTER XII. OPERATIONS UPON THE ORBIT. FOREIGN BODIES. In view of the peculiarities of the subject, it is thought best to give a few preliminaries before touching upon the operative measures of foreign bodies in the orbit. The latter are, for the most part: i. objects that have entered the orbit, as flying missies from explosions, such as fragments of iron or stone, and leaden balls; and 2. pieces left behind from articles that have been thrust into the cavity, like parts of sticks, stubs, pens, pencils, the ferules of umbrellas, etc. Hence, those most liable to these accidents are those who handle explosives or fire-arms and children who run with long, pointed implements in their hands. A large percenatge also come from stooping suddenly amidst stumps and stalks of vegetation. They usually penetrate by way of the skin of the lids or by that of the conjunctiva. Rarely, in their entry, they perforate the bony wall of the orbit, and, still more rarely, enter through the temporo- sphenoidal fissure. The distal extremity of the longer objects not infrequently penetrates one of the adjacent sinuses or the cranial cavity. It often happens that little children, because of their age, and older persons, because of their confusion at the moment of the accident, are not aware of anything having entered in the vicinity of the orbit; the only way it is discovered being through the secondary disturbances excited by the foreign body. Doubtless, in many instances, the intruder becomes so thoroughly encapsuled that it never causes any disturbance. This can be readily inferred from the marvelous manner in which, time and again, the orbital tissues have been known to tolerate foreign bodies. Enormous things have remained there for years without producing the slightest reac- tion. It is probable that to this cause are due many of the cases of paralytic squint, without a history, and of unaccountable mono- lateral amblyopia. Yet, it is a good thing for those who are uncon-

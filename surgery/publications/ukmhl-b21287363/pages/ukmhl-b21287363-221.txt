Conjunctival Route.—From the inner surface of the lid. 3. Cutaneous Route.—From the external surface of the lid. The first is preferable for the removal of the softer or cystoid varieties particularly, when not situated in the extreme upper portion of the superior tarsus. The only Instruments needed are a thin, sharp Beer's knife or a straight, keen bistoury and a small, oblong sharp curet. A drop of cocain solution is instilled. The positions of surgeon and subject, as concerns the upper lid (Fig. 92), are the same as for slitting and syringing the lower canalic- ulus (p. 134). The lid is slightly lifted from the globe by catching hold of the lashes with the right hand, the left forefinger is slid beneath, with the palmer tip in contact with the tumor, the left thumb is put in contact with it on the outside and it is held as one would a pea— / / k ■ Fig. 91.—Electrolysis of cilia.

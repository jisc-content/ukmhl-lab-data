25 PROTECTIVE MASKS AND SHIELDS. in Fig. 15. ll is of saleenâ€”black without and white within. It is treated with a heavy size in the making, then moulded into form, and can withstand considerable pressure without indenting. There are large concavities to receive the dressings, it fits nicely over the nose and is held on by four strings of black tape. Although it is made double, or binocular, it can easily be adapted to a single eye-dressing by merely cutting a good-sized hole on the side of the eye left open. Unfortunately, one will serve for a single case only, which is a slight drawback in a large charitable hospital, though not in private practice, as the mask is not expensive. I have long had in mind the idea of having made, after the Ring model, an aluminum mask, but with a circular opening ready-made at the cen- ter of each of the dressing concavities. Say these openings were one inch or an inch and a quarter in diameter, the mask would still afford ample protection from the usual sources of injury, and would be adapted to either monocular or binocular dressings. They could be manufactured economically by the stamping process, would be light, and could be cleansed and used over and over, indefinitely. Emerson, of New York, has also devised a practical protective mask. It is of wire, and in form is almost a counter- part of that of Ring. Fig. 16 shows the monocular wire mask of Fuchs. This is also made in binocular form. The last admit of vision in the unoperated eye if the dressing is left off. Figs. 17 and 18 represent rather cumbersome modifications of the Fuchs masks. Fig. 19 gives an idea of the metallic shield of Snellen. It is a shell-shaped contrivance with openings through which run the white tape by which it is kept in position. Fig. 16.

222 OPERATIONS UPON THE LIDS. the middle of the denuded portion of the upper tarsus and, in the same manner, through the skin flap of the lower lid and tied over a cylinder of some appropriate material. In closing the lids and knotting the thread the inner surface of the loosened skin flap is made to coapt with the raw surface of the upper tarsus. To com- plete the operation, a few, fine, superficial sutures are put in. Internal tarsorrhaphy was introduced by V. Arlt, for eversion of the punctum. It consisted in the resection of a horseshoe-shaped strip of skin around the lac lacrymale close to, and surrounding the inner canthus and unit- ing the upper and lower halves by sutures, thus preserving the puncta and canaliculi—a sort of artificial epicanthus (Fig. 96). The great Viennese was not extensively imi- tated in this respect. It finds its chief indication in those slight eversions FIG. o6.-Internal tarsorrhaphy. °f the PUncta that are S0 productive of annoying epiphora, and that are so unsatisfactory as to their treatment by conservative means. All that is necessary is to close the semicircle that constitutes the canthus itself—or, what the French call "the grand angle." This is accomplished by paring with delicate curved scissors a very narrow strip, just where skin and conjunctiva meet, rather inclining to the skin side, being scrupulous to avoid wounding the canaliculi and to stop safely short of reaching the puncta. The opposite raw surfaces are united by fine interrupted sutures, which are removed at the end of two or three days. Median tarsorrhaphy (Fig. 97), or the forced agglutination (more or less extended) of the opposing surfaces of the lid borders at or near the center of the palpebral fissure, was first done by Bow- man; but to Panas is due the credit of devising the improved mode. It is the most suitable operation, whether provisional or definitive, and is made as follows: The lids having been carefully approximated, one selects the

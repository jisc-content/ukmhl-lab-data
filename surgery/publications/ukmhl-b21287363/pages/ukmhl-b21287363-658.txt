648 THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. the circle representing the globe is disengaged more and more from the dark streaks of bone shadow. The second exposure, Fig. 292, was made with the tube at an inclination of 10° to the first, Fig. 293 at 200, and Fig. 294 at 30° It will be seen that in the last Fig. 292.—At an inclination of io°. radiograph the globe stands out clearly defined in a relatively shadowless space. At a still further inclination, the disengagement would be even more complete, but the distortion caused by the obliquity of the projection would be so pronounced as to render the result valueless. Fig. 293.—At an inclination of 200. The X-rays serve to locate most species of wood, glass, stone, and all the other metals as well as iron and steel. The proper distance of the tube from the plate is from 40 to 50 centimeters (16 to 20 inches). Since the rays emerge from the anti-

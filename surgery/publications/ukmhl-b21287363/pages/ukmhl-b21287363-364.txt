It is worthy of remark that all of these measures, as used in this connection, with the possible exception of electrolysis, radiation and canthoplasty, are as old as history itself, or nearly so. 1. MECHANICAL TREATMENT. (a) Scraping or Scratching.â€”This is probably the most ancient of any of the methods enumerated. Under the same heading one may class massage. Primitive peoples afflicted with trachoma, in seeking relief from the itching and other irritating effects of the disease, early learned to evert the lids and rub the granulations.

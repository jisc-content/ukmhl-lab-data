OPERATIONS UPON THE CONJUNCTIVA. 366 line indicates the parts excised. This conduces to less uneven- ness in the resulting cicatrix. Second, as to the placing and tying of the middle sutures. The usual way is to pass them first through the flap, from the conjunctival surface, then through the remnant of the tarsus to emerge and be tied on the conjunctiva. Now, to avoid contact of the knots with the cornea, which is dangerous as well as painful, he would advise the use of fine, double-armed Fig. 210.â€”Excision of tarsus. The heavy black line surrounds portion excised in extreme cases. sutures, introduced as follows: one needle passed through the flap of conjunctiva from the epithelial side, then through the remnant of tarsus, coming out at the free border almost in line with the cilia (Fig. 211). The other needle is made to pass through the tarsus in a similar manner, but slightly in front and to one side of the track of the first needle. Both needles are not put through the flap of conjunctiva. The two ends of thread are tied over a long slender cylinder of gauze or absorbent cotton that will fold upon itself without getting into the palpebral fissure. Two such double-armed sutures are required. The two outer sutures are knotted in the

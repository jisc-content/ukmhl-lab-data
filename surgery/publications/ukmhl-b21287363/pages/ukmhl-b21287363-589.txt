HISTORICAL. 581 In Germany, among the first enthusiastic advocates and modifiers of Daviels's operation, was August Gottlob Richter, the justly celebrated surgeon of Gottingen, whose labors extended over some twenty years, or from about 1770 to 1790. He, too, made downward section, including one-half the cornea, with a knife like that of Beranger, of Bordeau, save that for a short distance it was double- edged (Fig. 249). The work of Richter was carried on by Barth, of Vienna, and by his successor, the great Beer, the teacher of Graefe, Langenbeck, and the elder Jaeger. To the latter he became also father-in-law. Barth is said to have devised, in 1705, the triangular cataract knife commonly accredited to Beer. Barth changed the edge of the Fig. 249.—Richter, 17S0. Fig. 250.—Barth & Beer, 1795. Beranger knife from convex to straight, claiming for the latter form better cutting qualities and, like Daviel and Richter, made a down- ward ilap, including half the corneal base (Fig. 250). It may be mentioned that almost all of the operators, from Daviel down to the time of Beer—yes, even to the time of Desmarres—extracted with- out the use of either lid speculum or fixation appliance, which fact speaks well for their prudence as well as for their dexterity. Richter and Beer, operating, respectively, in Germany and Austria, so im- proved the instruments—in short, so advanced the status of the operation—that their methods have been termed classic; and, as a further tribute, their additions to the measure were adopted in the home of Daviel by the two greatest living ophthalmic surgeons, Sichel and Desmarres.

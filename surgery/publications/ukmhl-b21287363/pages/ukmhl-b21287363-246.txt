De la Personne,1 Angelucci,2 and others have also modified the Eversbusch procedure. Resection of the tarsus as a measure for the cure of ptosis was revived by Sir William Bowman, as an adjunct to resection of the orbicularis, as practised by his friend von Graefe. At a glance this method would seem to stand in a class by itself, yet virtually it is but an advancement of the muscles normally concerned in lifting up the lid. Bowman removed a portion of the tarsus and the contiguous portion of the orbicularis. Galezowski went still further and excised a strip that included the whole thickness of the lid. A well-known modification of the Bowman operation is that of Gillet de Grandemont.3 Gruening,* of New York, has, for some time, employed, with satisfactory results, a modified form of De Grandemont's method (Fig. 115). He uses it for almost any variety of ptosis, and performs it as follows: An incision is made through skin and orbicularis muscle, parallel with, and 4 mm. from, the free border. Skin and muscle are dissected up and retracted. A portion of the bared tarsus, com- prising its whole width, from inner to outer canthus, and the whole thickness, including the adherent conjunctiva, is cut out. The vertical diameter of the excised strip varies with the degree of ptosis, though it is always wider in the middle, where it may measure 7 mm., tapering almost to a point at either extremity. The tarsal wound is 1 Archiv. d'opht., vol. xxiii, p. 497, 1903. 2 Archiv. di Ottala. p. 489, 1904. 3 Bull, et mem. de la soc, Franc, d'opht., 1891, p. 80. 4 New York Eye and Ear Infirmary Reports, 1904.

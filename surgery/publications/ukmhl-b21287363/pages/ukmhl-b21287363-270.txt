ENTROPION. 262 (e) Relief of overtension of the lids and accompanying blepharo- phimosis: canthoplasty, cantholysis, and resection of the border fibres of orbicularis. Chronis, Agnew, Hotz. (/) Redressal of the underhang of the skin at the free border, and the turning up (not pulling up) of the cilia: dissection of lower lip down to the cilia. Panas. (g) Obviation of accompanying ptosis: tucking of levator tendon. Pagenstecher. Fig. 136.—Panas entropion operation. Fig. 137.—Panas entropion operation.

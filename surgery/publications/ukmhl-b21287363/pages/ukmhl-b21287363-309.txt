ECTROPION AND BLEPIIAROPLASTY. 3OI This brings us to a consideration of such questions as the prepara- tion of the lid and the selection and outlining of the ilap. Besides the principle just stated, there are a number of others to be observed in this connection. Before proceeding to mark out the skin that is to be transplanted, its new site is opened up and carefully prepared, so that its size and shape may be apparent, and all bleeding may be stopped in due time. If, as is most often the case, the operation Fig. 185. is for the correction of ectropion, an incision is made through the skin, three or four millimeters from the free border, whose length somewhat exceeds that of the everted part. The lips of this immediately retract, and the opening thus formed is deepened till muscle or underlying fascia is reached. The free border is seized by fixation forceps and pulled toward its normal position, the dissection being meanwhile carried toward the convex bor- der of the tarsus. The latter and the orbicularis are spared; that is, the restraining cicatricial bands are divided without cutting

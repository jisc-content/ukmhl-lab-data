MECHANICAL TR EA T M E NT. 359 Even that of Knapp, designed after the principle of a mangle, does not overcome this objection. Could one invent a practical roller forceps in which an intrinsic force, other than the pull on the handle, would impart the rotation to the tightly.clamped rollers, it would be ideal. Say a band, chain, gear, or screw. Lacking this, the best and most available instrument is the expresser of Kuhnt, the working part of which is composed of two coapting, perforated metal plates. The perforations are so arranged that no two come Fig. 206. opposite, one to the other, and the expression is effected by simple pression, i.e., without traction. In cases of advanced gelatinous degeneration of the fornices, the mere inversion of the lids causes laceration and bleeding. For these Kuhnt has had constructed what, he terms a modified expresser, one plate being perforated and the other solid. This he inserts beneath the uninverteel lid, finds the infiltrated tissue, and makes gentle pressure. The expressers are made of varying shapes and sizes, in order that one may reach any part of the conjunctival sac (Figs. 20(1, 207, 20S and 200). Fig. 207. Expression is highly efficacious in selected cases. It shortens the- course of treatment, forestalls ulceration of the cornea, prevents pannus, and reduces cicatricial contraction to the minimum. It is almost painless under the topic application or the submucous injection of cocain. It is simple of execution, and safe as to con- sequences. Patients may be operated on and allowed to depart at once for home, provided they live within calling distance, being instructed to keep quiet meanwhile and to bathe the lids with very hot water. For it must not be understood that they need no after-

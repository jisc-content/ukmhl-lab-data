9 THE OPERATING ROOM. winter, and that has an abundance of light. Particularly desirable is a broad north window. This insures a uniform light without interference by direct sunlight. If this window be set at an angle of 300 to 450, inclining inward, it is preferable to a perpendicular window. Operations wherein corneal reflections can be a disturb- ing factor are made easier by a window thus inclined. With the patient lying on the table, feet toward the vertical window, as is the favorite position, unless the table be so far removed from the window as to greatly reduce the illumination, the image of the window lies inconveniently high up on the cornea. Now, if the window were tilted toward the tabic, just in proportion as the slant of the window would increase up to 450, just in the same degree would the reflex be lowered. This is illustrated by the accompanying drawings. Fig. 5.—A, Reflex near vertical window. B, Reflex near inclined window. A and B represent the left eye of a subject lying on a table with feet toward the window. A shows the image of a vertical window and B that of one inclined inward about -jo°, the distance of the table from the window being the same in both instances. Next in choice to the inclined window as a source of light is the vertical, though to get the best illumination the table would be placed diagonally, with the foot near the window. A sky-light is not satisfactory. Perhaps the best all-around light is the artificial, for by the use of portable electric phosphores, or other electric hand-lamps, and large biconvex lenses, one can get whatever intensity is desirable, and can cause the reflexes to fall wherever they are least in the way. Walls, ceiling, floor, woodwork and furniture of the room are all white and of materials, or covered with materials, that most readily admit of washing, fumigating,

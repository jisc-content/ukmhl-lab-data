THE OPENING OF THE CAPSULE. 533 through the cornea. Some, like Czermak, put the thread in after completing the section; others after only partially making the cut, and yet others, before beginning it. Bourgeois,1 of Reims, in addition to the corneal suture, made a special form of outward section. The corneal suture has not proven a preventive of pro- lapse or incarceration of the iris, as it was hoped; nor does it hasten cicatrization. Besides, it is difficult to place, it prolongs the oper- ation, it harasses the patient, and the knot in the thread is a source of irritation. a bcdefgh i Fig. 243.—Forms of capsulotomy. The circle represents the dilated pupil. Those incisions that make angles whose bases are toward the corneal incision are bad because their flaps and tags get into the wound to cause iris prolapse and to delay healing, a, Von Graefe. b, Von Graefe, (crucial), c, Von Arlt. d, Von Arlt. e, Weber, f, DeWecker. g, Knapp. h, Czermak. i, Agnew. Suturing of the conjunctival flap has also been tried and with equally unsatisfactory results. Opening the Capsule.—From David's time down to the present, the prevailing method of opening the capsule has been to cut or scratch it by means of a pointed instrument—either a straight or an angular needle with one or both edges cutting, or a combi- nation of knife and needle. The position and extent of the cut have been much varied (see Fig. 243). That is to say, theoretically they have been of such and such forms, but, in reality, the figure assumed by the rent in the anterior capsule has, doubtless, been a very non- descript sort of affair. Knapp has said of it, "mostly, it (the capsulotomy) consists in an extensive and promiscuous laceration." The particular style or direction of the capsulotomy is generally supposed to have some bearing upon the healing process and, also, 1 Annales d'oculist, Jan., 1901, p. 10.

The primary incision extends for three and one-half centimeters along the median line of the shaved eyebrow down to the periosteum of the orbital rim. The lower lip is undermined and retracted until the tarsus is exposed. Two double- ..^^ armed silk or catgut sutures are put into the tarsus, one on either side of its center, and each pair of needles is carried upward a few millimeters apart, but in their course, instead of traversing the orbicularis, as Dran- sart's do, they are quilted through the tarso-orbital fascia and brought out so as to include the mus- cular and connective tissue just beneath the upper lip of the brow incision. The sutures are drawn up to the degree desired for the elevation of the lid and tied. The sutures, or ligatures, are left to be absorbed or encapsuled Thus, not only are there two cicatricial cords connecting tarsus and frontalis, but there is also a shortening Fig. 107.—Wilder.

Panas1 is the author of what has been one of the most popular operative modes for the relief of ptosis.

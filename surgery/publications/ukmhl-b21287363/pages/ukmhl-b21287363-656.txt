THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. 646 the plate, furnish all the information needed to determine the situation of the foreign body. . • The general plan is illustrated by the accompanying figure 290: Let B represent the foreign body S S' the points of emission of the rays—from two tubes at once or from the same tube in different positions. The conic projection of B on the plate P gives us the two points b, b'. The positions of S S' and b b' are known, and their distances, one from another, are measurable. Hence, to determine the position in space occupied by B, all that is required is to join V to S', and b to S, either by real lines, as of wire in the apparatus, s s' Fig. 290.—Guilloz's method of localization of iron in eye. or by lines traced on a diagram wherein the points S S' and b b' have been placed. This first process absolutely determines the point B holds in space. Its relative position can then be ascertained with relation to certain guide-marks. To Control the Eye.—The direction of the eye should be the same at the time of the exposure (or exposures) to the rays as at the time of the surgical intervention. Omit this precaution and the whole procedure of localization comes to naught. A small sheet of metal is pierced with a round opening the size of the cornea. When this is placed in front of the eye it is easy to make the circle of the cornea correspond to that of the aperture. To this sheet of metal are fastened three legs or processes that extend just to the centers of the guide-marks placed on the orbital rim. At any time that it be- comes desirable to reproduce the position the eye was in at the time

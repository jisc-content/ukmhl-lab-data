OPHTHALMIC SURGERY. i CHAPTER I. PARA-OPERATIVE TECHNIC. Asepsis.—According to Snellen, all wounds, especially those of the eye, tend to heal per primam intentionem, and it is gratifying to know that the work of the ophthalmic surgeon has made good this assertion. While it is true that this branch of surgery has seemed to profit more than the others by antiseptic measures, yet, when we consider the status of our knowledge of the value and of the means of asepsis, our operative results are a reproach. The fact remains that the vast majority of untoward consequences are due to some form of infection. Thus the advantage is still on the side of the operator who is most thorough and consistent in carrying out antiseptic precautions, rather than on the side of mere skill. Lack of these precautions oft turns into abject failure the most brilliantly executed surgical measure, while attention to them can make a perfect triumph of a wretched bungle. We are in constant need not only of an "antiseptic conscience," but of an aseptic subconsciousness as well. We should acquire a habit of surgical cleanliness and try to impart it to everybody about us. Unless one is broadly grounded in this training, he is being forever the victim of his own anti-climaxes, as, for example, picking his teeth with his finger-nail, scratching his head, or taking an instrument between his lips just after having made the most elaborate and up- to-date preparation for an operation. With some of the older ones the genuine habit is difficult—at times impossible—to attain. With the younger ones it should be easy. The key-note to asepsis is sterilization. This is of two kinds, relative and absolute. The first refers to the preparation of the hands and persons of surgeons, attendants, patients, and of the

583 HISTORICAL. employed a thin, broad, curved spoon or spatula as the traction instrument (scoop extraction). In the meantime, Albrecht v. Graefe, of Berlin, had begun his brilliant though brief career. After Daviel, he who made the most profound impression upon the principles and the art not only of the surgery of cataract, but upon the science of ophthalmology as a whole, was von Graefe. At the early age of thirty he had sounded the depths and the shallows of the two methods of linear and flap extraction. He recognized their respective failings and advantages. From the suppurations and lack of coaptation of the flap extraction, he sought refuge (1853) in the more prompt healing of the linear incision placed in the sclera; and from the iris, capsule, and cortex Fig. 253.—Travers, 1812. Fig. 254.—Von Graefe, 1859. complications, in the removal of the contiguous portion of the iris, as first definitely recommended, as a part of the operation, by Schifferli, of Jena, in 1776. In this he reverted to the operation of Travers, making a small incision in the upper limbus, adding iri- dectomy, and delivering the lens by means of the clumsy spoons devised by his assistant, Waldau. He confined the operation to the softer forms of cataract or to those with soft cortex and small hard nucleus. But for the sclerosed, more voluminous senile cataracts he still made the flap extraction. Little by little he raised and extended the incision of Travers, until it approached more nearly to the linear, in effect, until it was finally placed wholly in scleral tissue, substituting for the lance-knife his straight narrow Schmalmesser (1859). (Fig. 254). Although Daviel never relinquished his early manner of making the section, i.e., beginning with his small lancedvnife and enlarging

ECTROPION. 290 border, and the lid turned back into position. The lateral flaps are dissected up and brought together, the resulting lines of union present- ing the shape of a capital T. External tarsorrhaphy completes the operation (Figs. 162 and 163). It is rather curious to note that von Graefe, according to Baudry,1 applied the same operation, minus the tarsorrhaphy, to entropion of the lower lid. Fig. 162.—Dieffenbach. Fig. 163.—Dieffenbach. A classic operation for cicatricial ectropion of either upper or lower lid, is that of Wharton-Jones, slightly modified by Sanson (Figs. 164 and 165). Two converging incisions, beginning near the free border, are made to include the scar and meet beyond it, like the letter V, upright for the lower lid, inverted for the upper. The triangular flap is loosened from its apex to its base at the cilia, and the surrounding skin is undermined. The lid is righted and the approximating lips of the incision are joined by sutures, the lines of juncture now resembling a Y instead of a V. Tarsorrhaphy may be added, or the lid may be anchored by collodionized strips of gauze to the cheek (if the upper) or to the forehead (if the lower). Such an operation has a great advantage over those like that of Dieffenbach in that it does not call for a further sacrifice of integu- ment, and should have precedence whenever practicable. Von Graefe conceived the idea of correcting extensive ectropion of the lower lid by making a flap the whole width of the lid and extending downward ten to twelve millimeters. He split the lid into its two leaves, the anterior composed of skin and muscle, the posterior of tarsus and conjunctiva, by an intermarginal incision the entire length of the palpebral fissure.

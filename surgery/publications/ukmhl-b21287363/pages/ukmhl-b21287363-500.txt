Delivery of the Cataract.—The back of the Graefe spoon is placed against the globe, well down in the lower fornix, and the back of the flat spoon is laid on just behind the incision above; the patient is told to look constantly downward (Fig. 237). (Some operators have a light held low down for the subject to fix his eyes upon.) The lower spoon is pressed firmly and steadily, but not too forcibly, toward the center of the globe, while with the upper one the Fig. 238.—Moment in the delivery of a cataract when the cortex should be driven up. posterior lip of the incision is depressed, keeping both still, i.e., not rubbing them back and forth nor up and down.

THE TECHNIC. 149 around with dull-pointed scissors is begun: first, loosen the outer or lateral side, then the inner or median side, then the back, which lies deep in its fossa, then up about the cupola. The shelling-out of the sac is greatly facilitated by passing a strabismus hook behind it as soon as its body is exposed. This can, by alternately pulling gently upon it and working it up and down, be made to assist Fig. 62.—1, Supra-orbital artery and vein. 2, Nasal artery. 3, Angular arterv. 4, Facial artery. 5, Infra-orbital artery. 6, Branch of superficial temporal artery. 7, Malar branch of transverse artery of the face. 8, Superior palpebral artery. 9, Anastomoses. 10, Inferior palpebral arterv. 11, Facial vein. 12, Angular vein. 13, Branch of superficial temporal vein. 14, Lacrimal sac. 15, Internal canthal ligament. 15', External canthal ligament. 16, Lacrimal artery. 17, Ligament of the tarsus. 18, Tarso-orbital fascia.—(After Testut.) materially in the loosening process. Scrupulously avoid cutting the sac, the canaliculi, the tendo oculi, the inferior oblique muscle, or making an opening in the tarso-orbital fascia or septum orbitale. This last is about the gravest accident that could happen during the operation in question, as it could lead to septic cellulitis of the orbit, to loss of sight through necrosis of the cornea, or through strangulation of the optic nerve, or infection of the choroid, or to death itself, by ascending meningitis or by thrombo-phlebitis

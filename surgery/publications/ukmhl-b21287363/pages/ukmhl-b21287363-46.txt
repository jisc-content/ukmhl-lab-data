PARA-OPERATIVE TECHNIC. 3§ Irrigators or Douches.—These refer to various appliances by which quantities of liquid are brought into contact with the eye for therapeutic purposes. They work by (i) pouring, as from special vessels, the stream being directed by a spout and controlled by placing the finger as a valve over a separate opening; or by (2) gravity, as from elevated reservoirs, when the stream is directed by a rubber tube and controlled by compressing the tube; or by (3) ejection, as from some form of syringe, in which the stream is directed as in either of the foregoing, but is controlled by pressure upon a rubber bulb. To the first belong the divers glass and enameled flasks known as undines, compte-gouttes, etc. (Fig. 23); to the second, the Fig. 23.—a, Undine, b, Morax compte-gouttes. c, Wickerkiwicz eye douche, d, Tumbler to show relative size. fountain syringes, the percolators, and the tube syphons; to the third, the bulb syringes, bulb-syphons, and hand-sprays. The eye-dropper is but a form of bulb-syringe. The glass flasks are most appropriate for gentle washing of the eye. They are neat and cleanly, and the stream is gentle except they be held too high. They are necessarily of limited capacity in order to be convenient to hold with one hand, therefore adapted to the less copious and prolonged irrigations. Those in the second category are just the ones designed for irriga- tion on the larger scale. The reservoir is of soft rubber, enameled metal, or glass, and may be of any desired size. Some of them are quite elaborate, having means for heating, thermometer attach- ment, etc. Reservoirs of glass, however, will always appeal more

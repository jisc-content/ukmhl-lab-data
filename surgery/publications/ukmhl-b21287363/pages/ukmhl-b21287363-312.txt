ECTROPION. were prudent so to lay out the flap as to necessitate the minimum torsion in rotation—all things else being considered—as this alone tends to strangulation. It pays to study carefully the original cicatrix, particularly with the view to ascertaining the lines of greatest strain. Here is where the overeffect must be most pronounced, which concerns both the prepa- ration of the lid—extensive opening up; and that of the flap— surplus width at the points indicated. Fig. 187. Provisional tarsorrhaphy has been extensively practised as an adjunct to blepharoplasty. In the correction of cicatricial ectro- pion, however, where the repair is made with flaps or grafts, the procedure so far from being of advantage, is a positive detriment, in that it prevents the getting of that very pronounced primary overeffect which is an indispensable element of success in these operations. No doubt, the employment of it has had much to do with the discouraging experiences so many surgeons have had in such surgery.

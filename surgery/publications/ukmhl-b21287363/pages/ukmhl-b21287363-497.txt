489 SIMPLE PERIPHERAL CORNEAL FLAP EXTRACTION. rather rocking than sawing—till,when the edge has just reached the upper angle of the iris, it is given about one-eighth of a turn back- ward, and made to emerge beneath the conjunctiva, so as to make a small conjunctival flap (Fig. 235). The length of this flap should be about three or four millimeters, and the width four or live milli- meters. When sufficient of the conjunctiva has been lifted up, the edge of the knife is suddenly turned directly forward and the flap cut off. The fixation forceps is now removed and the operator, himself, may support the brow. Before going further the con- Fig. 235.—Finishing the corneal section and fashioning the conjunctival flap. junctival flap is turned down over the cornea, else it may give trouble later by getting into the incision. This is best clone with the back of the ready-to-be-discarded knife and not with any instrument that has yet to enter the globe. In completing the corneal section, it is best to slow up somewhat so as to cut out without a sudden jerk, as this might have the effect of producing a prolapse of the iris or of causing an involuntary movement on the part of the patient, such as a spasm of the orbic- ularis. Indeed, the only period in the making of the section that should be as brief as possible is that between the instant of counter- puncture and the moment when the edge of the knife has just passed

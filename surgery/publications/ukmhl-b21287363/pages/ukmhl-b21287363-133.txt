PROBES. 125 There arc various other forms of the lacrimal probe, notable among them the series devised and successfully managed by Theo- bald, of Baltimore. It comprises sixteen instruments graduated by one-fourth millimeters from one-fourth to four millimeters. Most eye specialists do not avor those that exceed four or five millimeters. Whether the upper or the lower route be selected as the better way from punctum to sac would seem to be largely a matter of individual choice. Much can be said in favor of either, though the lower canaliculus is favored by the majority and is the one now in question. Bowman's probes are always serviceable, though die bulbous tips go best (Fig. 50). The writer1 employs a series of gold sounds that he devised several years ago, represented actual size in the accompanying illus- tration (Fig. 51), and finds them both serviceable and easy of ma- nipulation.

The working end of the instrument is spindle-shaped and is surmounted at the tip by a small guiding bulb whose diameter is considerably less than that of 1 American Journal of Ophthalmology, Oct., 1901.

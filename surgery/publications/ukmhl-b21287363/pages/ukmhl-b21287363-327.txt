Mode of Operation (Berger).â€”An exact pattern of the lid defect is cut out of oil silk or court plaster, the arm is approached to the eye, and the point that makes the easiest and most natural con- tact is marked in ink, as the site of the pedicle. The pattern is then laid on in such a manner that the pedicle will be neither twisted, stretched, nor compressed, and so outlined that the area of the Hap will be one-fourth to one-third greater than that of the model. The subcutaneous fat, as well as the superficial fascia, are included with the skin. Near the pedicle, the aponeurosis is slightly raised in order that the nourishing vessels may be free from pressure. All the wounded vessels of any size- are tied. After many trials Berger adopted, as the fixing apparatus, a leather corset provided with a collar and cap, all articulated by laces and straps and strengthened by steel braces. A laced leather gauntlet, ex- tending from the hand to a point above the elbow, put on and strapped to the cap, holds the arm firmly to the head (Fig. 102). Numerous fine, superficial, silk sutures are put in to hold the flap while, near the pedicle, a few, deep, strong ones are inserted to aid in resisting traction. Salol, boric acid, or iodoform powder (the last used guardedly) is dusted into the nooks and upon the other parts. Over this, gauze or a thin layer of cotton, wet with boric acid solution; on this, padding of cotton, and overall a bandage. Liquid food and constant watching by an attendant. Quiet in bed for four or five clays, then propped up for a short time at intervals. After a week, sitting in an easy-chair, and even walking cautiously about the room. The pedicle is divided near the end of the second week. Fig. 192.

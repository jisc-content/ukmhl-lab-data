POSITIONS OF HEAD AND TUBE. 647 of the exposure, it suffices merely to place the processes on the cor- responding guide-marks, then cause the cornea and the opening to coincide. Guilloz claims to have accurately located by the foregoing method a piece of steel weighing only 1 milligram. None of the methods are infallible. The severest tests of the two just given are when dealing with a very minute foreign body situated far at the opposite side of the eye from the tube, or in line with the denser bone shadows that are interposed. Here they may fail. Choice of Relative Positions of Head and Tube.—To obtain a radioscopic view or to make a radiographic exposure of the eye that shall be least obstructed by surrounding bone are matters worth considering. Figs. 291 to 294 are from radiographs of the Fig. 291.—Perpendicular. orbital region made by Guilloz, and are adapted from Volume IV of the French Fncyclopedia of Ophthalmology. The black circle represents the globe of the eye. These pictures were made with the view to ascertaining, by shifting the relative positions of tube and head, how great is the interference of the heavy lhadows of surrounding bone with the area occupied by the eyebalk The left eye is in question; i.e., the plate is fixed to the left temple. In each instance the distance from tube—or point of emission of the X-rays— from the photographic plate is 60 centimeters, and the plate is placed parallel with the sagittal plane of the head. In the first exposure, Fig. 291, the long axis of the head was at right angles to the tube. About one-half the shadow of the eye is covered by the dense shadow of the external rim of the orbit. Now, in proportion as the tube is moved forward, or as the head is inclined to the right,

In other words, that in looking up, for example the lid does not lag behind.1 For a number of years past I have practised, with most gratifying results, a method that combines the principles of the Anagnos- takis-Hotz entropion oper- ation, the tucking of the levator tendon of Evers- busch, and a little of the suture arrangement of Pagenstecher2 (Figs. 119 and 120). A lid horn is put beneath the upper lid. An incision is made along the sulcus, rather in its upper slope than exactly in its bottom, through skin and muscle, and extending the whole length of the tarsus. The divided fibres of the orbicularis are undermined, both above and below, exposing the tarsus and its suspensory ligament. Four curved, one-inchdong needles, carrying two sutures (i.e., double- armed) of No. 3 braided silk, boiled in vaselin-paraffm, are in readiness. Each needle is passed through the lower flap near its edge, from within outward, then through a horizontal fold of the tarso-orbital fascia—really the tendon of the levator—picked up by broad-jawed fixation forceps, thence upward, quilting, or, as Wilder says, "gathering" the septum orbitale, and brought out well above the supercilia. A handy way of picking up the deep fascia at any chosen point, !For further remarks on the Motais operation see Summary at end of chapter. 2 Oph. Record. 16 Fig. 120. -Beard's method for ptosis.

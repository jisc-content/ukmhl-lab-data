ECTROPION AND BLEPHAROPLASTY. 283 Fig. is.- Kuhnt, No. 1. tarsus, but further out, splitting the lid between them. The two clefts thus made are sutured separately. These procedures are equally applicable to certain cases of cicatricial ectropion as, for example, from a small scar that may be included in the excised por- tion. A quite satisfactory way, hit upon by the writer, of deal- ing with the defect in ques- tion, is to make canthotomy and extend slightly the skin cut, then loosen around, be- low, remove a small triangle of skin containing a few cilia, force out—skin as it were— the outer extremity of the lower tarsus, grasp it with fixation forceps, and while skin and conjunctiva are retracted, pass a No. 2 silkworm, or catgut, suture through, from without, at a distance from the cut end proportioned to the length of the proposed shortening, after which the superfluous bit of the tarsus is abscised. Now, a small triangle of integument and muscle (base in) is cut H from the upper lip of the $) canthotomy, exposing the ex- ternal canthal ligament. Through the latter is passed, from within, the suture just put into the tarsus, the ends are knotted and cut off short, while the skin opening is united by fine black silk sutures, and the conjunctival The buried suture is afterward absorbed Fig. 154.—Kuhnt, No. incision is left to itself, or encapsuled (Fig. 157).

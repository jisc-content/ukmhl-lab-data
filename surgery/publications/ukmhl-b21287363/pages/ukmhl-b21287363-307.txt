ECTROPION AND BLEPHAROP1ASTY. 299 outward, from the temple and forehead (Fig. 177). For an ex- treme ectropion of the whole lower lid, Denonvilliers utilized an enormous flap, cut from in front of the ear, with pedicle just external to the outer canthus (Figs. 178 and 179). For the repa- ration of an angular loss of substance—external or internal—the Fig. 181.—Hasner. bifurcate pedicle, as first employed by Hasner, serves admirably (Figs. 180 and 181). For a yet more elaborate restitution of a commissure, the process of Richet1 is cited. The primary defect was an inferoexternal ectropion, from an adherent scar of the orbital rim, with fungus growth. After crescentic excision of the diseased portion a and righting c Fig. 182.—Richet. Fig. 183.—Richet. of the lid (Fig. 182), a provisional tarsorrhaphy was made and the threads were attached to the brow by collodion. Next, the flaps b and c were fashioned (Fig. 183), which were interchanged and sutured to cover the defect as shown in Fig. 184. 1 Recueil d'ophtalmologie, 1873.

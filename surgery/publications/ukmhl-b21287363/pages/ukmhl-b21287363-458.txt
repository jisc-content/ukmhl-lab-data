OPERATIONS UPON THE GLOBE. 45° clear the iris with the keratome (Fig. 229). The anatomic arrangement of the tissues at the base of the iris is such as to cause the rent naturally to occur in the most favorable, i.e., the most peripheral situation, viz., in the cribriform portion of the ciliary zone of the iris. Indeed, it is not difficult by this method to make a coloboma whose lateral dimensions exceed the length of the primary incision, and, on occasion, one whose base is more peripheral than are the inner lips of the incision. With a good bite of the forceps, near the mid-zone of the iris, it is easy to tear the entire membrane from its attachment to the annular ligament. It is well to bear in mind the frailty of this fastening. Another condition that adds to the efficiency of tearing the base of the coloboma is that there is usually less bleeding than from cutting. In case of an overhanging inner lip or partial splitting of the cornea, it is best, as soon as the forceps has secured the necessary substantial hold upon the iris, to start the tear by pushing the instrument toward the center of the cornea, as it will then yield more readily than by drawing the iris at once into the wound. , Accidents During the Operation of Iridectomy.—Something untoward can occur at any step, from the beginning of the incision to the completion of the toilet. Taken in their order, those most likely to happen are: 1. Faulty Incision.—This has reference to the placing, the direction, and the extent. If the wound lies decidedly within the clear cornea, it is objectionable in nearly every form of iridectomy. In the optical form the scar might encroach too much upon an important transparent area. In glaucoma the drawbacks of such a wound are obvious, for, as has been seen, both incision and coloboma must here be peripheral. Then, too, the further removed

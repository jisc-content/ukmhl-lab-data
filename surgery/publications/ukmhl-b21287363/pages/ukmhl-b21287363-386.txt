The form of the points is a matter of individual preference. Per- haps the best adapted to all-around work is the simple, almost closed loop of round or slightly flattened wire, though the olive tip is excel- lent in many cases (Fig. 214).

The electro-cautery has enjoyed a deserved degree of popularity in the treatment of corneal ulcers, but the necessary accessory equipment for its use is frequently not available when it is most needed and it is always open to the objection of a clumsy handle and difficult regulation of the current so as to produce the desired amount of heat. The demand for a simple, effective, and ever-ready instrument has produced Wordsworth's cautery (Fig. 215), consisting of the regulation instrument handle and shank, on the end of which is a copper bulb about five millimeters in diameter. The end of the shank is bent at an obtuse angle so as to allow a good view of

OPERATIONS UPON THE EXTRINSIC MUSCLES. 1 American Journal of Ophthalmology, March, 1889. over-effect without knowing how much of it will disappear. More- over, he believes it of the greatest importance that the original point of insertion be left intact, to prevent an oblique attachment, which could occur through sliding about of the advanced tendon. It is evident that the foregoing remarks do not refer to that form of advancement in which a solid anchorage is obtained for the thread in episcleral or in scleral tissue. The Beard Shortening Operation.â€”Fig. 80 illustrates an operation devised by the author1 some time ago, which is adapted to certain cases where shortening of the muscle, and not advance- ment, is desired; though I must admit I have rarely found occasion to practise it. The tendon of the opposite muscle is buttonholed, as if for the advancement opera- tion. Here also the suture is a double-armed one, the needles being of a half-curved variety and very sharp. The primary incision is the same as in the advancement, though here the tendon is laid bare. Fig. 80. In this operation the advance- ment forceps must be used. This instrument fixes the tendon mid- way of the parallelogram included between the vertical lines (Fig. 80), which, of course, varies in length according to the degree of shortening needed. The tendon is then divided at the point occupied by the line near the cornea, and the forceps given to an assistant. Catching hold of the stump of tendon with mouse-toothed forceps, the needles are passed down through the insertion, hugging the sclera, one near the upper, the other near the lower border. They are then carried beneath the tendon, without crossing the thread, and brought out correspondingly from below, and far enough back of the fixing forceps to insure a firm hold; the loop, however, is not drawn down, but is left very long, as shown in the drawing. Here the operator takes the forceps from the assistant and cuts the

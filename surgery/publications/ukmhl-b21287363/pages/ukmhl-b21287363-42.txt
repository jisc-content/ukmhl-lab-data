PARA-OPERATIVE TECHNIC. 34 Applicators, Brushes and Swabs.—An applicator may be of metal or wood. It serves merely at the handle for a brush or a swab. Of the metals silver is probably the best adapted to the purpose. Excellent wood applicators are found ready made in tooth-picks, especially those made of bamboo, called Japanese. The great advantage of these is their extreme cheapness, admitting of throwing away after once using. Whatever the material, the eye applicator must be delicate and light. One and one-half to two mm. thick at the large end, thence gradually tapering to a point, or nearly, and ten to twelve centimeters in length. Not infre- quently metal applicators are seen that are roughened, or nicked, for a short distance from their working ends. This will do in a Fig. 21.—a, To make a brush, b, To make a swab. wooden one, that is not used a second time, but is a serious draw- back in a metal one, for reasons given further along. The same objections may be urged to the probe, or bulbous pointed applicator. Formerly, camels' hair brushes were used in the treatment of eyes. In the light of modern medical science they would be deemed abomi- nations, and justly so. The ideal brush, or swab, is now made of absorbent cotton wound onto an applicator. It all lies in the manner of the winding whether the brush or a swab is the result. The difference between the two is just what the names imply—the brush having a pliant free end and the swab being a compact bunch. To make a brush a small quantity of cotton is taken from the rool and its irregularities of outline are pulled off till it assumes the square shape shown in Fig. 21. It is so held between the left thumb and index that the fibres composing it run horizontally. The small end of the applicator is laid diagonally across the upper right

METHOD OF GUILLOZ. 645 and which can be made rigid by the action of a thumb-screw. The lower part of each arm is fitted with a hinged articulation, carrying a short, hollow cylinder, through which slides a lateral branch, and that is also provided with a thumb-screw to make it rigid. Assuming that the distances separating the guide-markers, one from the other, is known, as also those of the foreign body from said guide-markers, to adjust the compass a triangle, A B C, is con- structed (Fig. 289), whose sides represent the distances between the guide-markers. The points of the lateral branches of the compass are placed on the three points of the triangle and set with the thumb- screws. The central stem is pushed down to fall at the point X in Fig. 289 the triangle, and the distanceXA, XB, and XC are found by stepping. Now, to facilitate the regulation of the compass, take a bit of per- forated lead, X, attach to three other bits of lead, A, B, and C, by wires; the points of the branches are struck into the corresponding leads, and the central branch is pushed down until the wires are stretched. The compass thus adjusted, the distances are verified by means of ordinary dividers, and he arrangement is perfected by stepping. The result obtained, the central stem is set tight by the screw in the flange, and the mark on the graduated scale that is flush with (he top of the collar, is noted. If the compass were placed on the subject's head, the points of the lateral branches in contact with their corresponding guide-markers, the direction of the central stem would indicate the position of the foreign body, for if it were pushed clown to the point noted on the scale, its point would rest upon the said body. The process is not only accurate, but simple. The shadows on the photographic plate (or positive), together with the known distance of the tubes from

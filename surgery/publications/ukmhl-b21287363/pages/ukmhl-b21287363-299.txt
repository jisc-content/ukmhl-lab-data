ECTROPION AND BLEPHAROPLASTY. 291 ran two vertical cuts, extending as far as the lower rim of the orbit. The flap thus outlined, was dissected up, the ectropion corrected and the tarsus, together with the overlying flap, forcibly drawn upward. The flap was then joined to the adjacent skin by interrupted sutures, beginning below, for about one-half the distance. The top or elongated corners of the flap were rabbeted (Fig. 166 a be). The upper edge, thus shortened, was put upon the stretch and stitched to the free border of the tarsus, the ends of thread being left long and fastened, in a pad of collodionized cotton, to the Fig. 164 forehead. A few shallow sutures were placed in the remaining vertical skin openings and over all a compressive bandage. The chief objection to this operation lies in the fact that new tissue is not supplied to help the graft in supporting the lid. F. Jaeger1 devised a thoroughly rational and practical operation for cicatricial ectropion of the upper lid, where the ciliary border was so displaced as to lie close to the supercilia. It may be classed as a sliding-flap method. He made cutaneous incision as long as the palpe- bral fissure, close to and parallel with the margin, un- dermined the tarsus and turned the lid down into place. If the border seemed much elongated, he excised from the center a wedge that included the entire thickness and brought together the edges of the notch by means of a surgical pin and figure-of-8 ligature.

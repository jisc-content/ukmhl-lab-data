ENTROPION. 260 The originator of tarsoplasty in this connection was Streatfield.1 His operation consisted in the removal of a large horizontal wedge of tissue from the upper lid, which was composed of skin, orbicularis, and a small part of the center of the tarsus. No sutures were employed, the wound having been left to heal by granulation in order to increase the effect of the operation (Fig. 135). Thus was the third requisite (c) to the success of this branch of surgery provided. It occurred to Snellen, of Utrecht, to combine this guttering of the tarsus with the Anagnostakis2 method, the only difference being that double-armed sutures were used, starting in, through, coming back to the lower skin flap, and tying over glass beads. Chroniss added canthoplasty and, about the same time, Agnew subjoined external tenotomy or can- tholysis to this procedure, and by these means the second requirement of (e) was obtained. Panas-* made a similar operation to that of Snellen with two or three highly significant differences, viz., the careful dissecting up of the lower skin flap as far down as possible not to cut Fig. 132.- -Gayet's entropion operation.

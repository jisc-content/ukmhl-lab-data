SCISSORS. 87 for enucleation scissors. They look now as if they belonged to a veterinary kit. Terson,1 of Paris, is the originator of a pair of enucleation scissors that appeal strongly to one's sense of practicality and fitness (Fig. 37). The blades are perfectly smooth and slightly curved on the flat. They are of precisely the same lateral dimensions, so that when closed their borders are exactly even. Their extremities are broadly rounded. Their most striking peculiarities lie in the fact that the inner or concave blade is extremely thick, while the outer, or convex one, is proportionately thin, and that neither blade is beveled or cut away at the side corresponding to the edge. The thick blade holds or pushes the globe forward at the time the optic nerve is severed. Straight Scissors.—Two pairs of straight scissors are needed. One extra strong pair, with blades 3 1/2 centimeters long and 8 mm. across the base, for canthotomy, cutting mucous grafts from the lip, enlarging cutaneous incisions, etc. One blade should he heavier at the end than the oilier, and neither must be sharp-pointed. The second straight pair are built on delicate lines—blades 27 mm. long and scant 5 mm. across the base, and with the combined rounded ends 1 mm. wide. These are best for making straight incisions in the conjunctiva and in a number of ways. Iris Scissors.—It is customary among oculists to have a pair of extremely delicate, curved scissors exclusively for cutting the iris. The smaller pair of strabismus scissors would do in an emergency, though their points are a little too thick for cutting the membrane close to the cornea. The blades of the regulation iris scissors are about 2 1/2 centimeters long, 4 mm. across the base, and taper down to a fine, not keen, point where the thickness of the two superposed ends does not exceed 1/3 of a mm.

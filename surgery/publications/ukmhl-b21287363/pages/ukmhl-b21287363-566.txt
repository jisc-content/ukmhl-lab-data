558 EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. Mrs. J. K., age 27, Jewess. Seen first Jan. 5, 1892. High myopia, right; high myopic and astigmatism, left. Had been cured of trachoma and vascular keratitis. Conical cornea in both eyes. R. V. =2/200; 20/100+ 1 w —20 D. L. V. = 5/200; 20/100 + 1 w —15 s O — 5 cyl. ax 1350. Under atropin the following lenses were prescribed: Right —18 D; Left, —15 s O— 5 cyl. ax, 135°. Saw patient no more until Nov. 14, 1899. Age now 35. Test then showed;—R. V. = 2/200; 20/100 w —25 D; L. V. = 4/200; 20/100 + w —20 s O — 3 cyl. ax 1500. Advised dis- cission which was done in the right eye, Dec. 1 5, 1899. The first operation consisted in a mere pricking of the anterior capsule. Little or no effect. One week later a bolder discission. Lens slowly disappeared. To be brief, the first or slight operation on the left eye was made Oct. 11, 1900. The patient was now 36 years old. By Feb. r, 1901, the lens had entirely disappeared. The remarkable features of the case are the prompt absorption of the lenses following the second or thorough discissions and the ultimate refractive and visual results, which in Septem- ber of 1903, were as follows: Right eye, with —4 cyl. ax 1200 V. = 20/20 + 4. Left eye, with —2.5 so— 2.5 cyl. ax no0 V. = 20/30 + 1. For reading, added +3 and +2. The corneal cones, in consequence of the operations and the prolonged bandaging, had in great measure subsided. Many of us have seen ready absorption in much older persons after traumatism of the lens. A striking instance once came under my observation. A machinist, aged 49, was struck in the eye_ by a flying chip of brass. The man came immediately for treatment. A thin sliver of the metal was seen with its proximal extremity within the anterior chamber and its distal buried deeply in the crystalline. It was removed through the enlarged corneal wound. Absorption of the resulting cataract was affected in an incredibly short space of time, and good sight was restored to the eye. In my service at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, about two years ago, I made discission for cataract in case of a woman past 45—first upon one eye, then upon the other. The first cataract disappeared promptly. The loosened hard nucleus of the second fell into the anterior chamber causing some irritation, and was extracted through a small linear (lance) incision by means of a sharp hook. The result was perfect in both eyes. True, after the disappearance of all the cortical portion of the lens, in subjects verging on, or actually in, middle life, a tiny hard nucleus may occasionally drop down either behind or in front of the iris, and there become the source of considerable irritation. But this can be easily extracted through a small incision with the lance keratome by means of the open sharp hook. Fortunately, these dense lens remains usually fall into the anterior chamber, where they are less provocative of harm and whence they are extricable with less risk and difficulty than if located in the posterior

PTERYGIUM. 345 McReynolds,1 of Dallas, has, by a most ingenious and effective modification of the original Desmarres operation, given new im- petus to the transplantation method in this country. The present writer is among the many who can testify, from experience with a number of cases, to the excellence of the procedure. The different steps of the operation, as described by its author, are as follows: 1. Grasp the neck with strong narrow forceps. 2. Pass a Graefe knife through the constriction and as close as possible to the globe; then, with the cutting edge turned toward the cornea, shave the growth smoothly from that membrane. 3. With the fixation forceps still hold the pterygium and with slender straight scissors divide the conjunctiva and the subconjunctival tissue along the lower margin of the pterygium, commencing at the neck and extending to the canthus, a distance of 1/4 to 1/2 inch. 4. Still hold the pterygium with the forceps and separate the body of the growth from the sclera with any small, non-cutting instrument. (A flat Graefe strabismus hook serves admirably.) 5. Now separate well from the sclera the conjunctiva lying be- low the oblique incision made with the scissors. 6. Take black silk thread, armed at each end with smallest curved needles and carry both of these needles through the apex of the pterygium from within outward. Separate one from the other by sufficient amount of the growth to secure a firm hold (Fig. 203). 1 Journal of the American Medical Association, Aug. 9, 1902.

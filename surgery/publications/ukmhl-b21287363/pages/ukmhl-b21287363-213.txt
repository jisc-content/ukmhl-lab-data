Fine needles, of proper shape and irreproachable sharp- ness, together with steadying the globe by holding with fixation forceps the tendon at its attachment, go a long way toward lessen- ing the labor of this step; though nothing but practice will give the necessary skill. This can be attained to a tolerable degree by operating upon pig's eyes in a mask. To give the lines of anchorage a highly divergent direction serves three important purposes: 1. It prevents the thread in its back- ward course to the loop from overlying the cornea. 2. The ad- vancement can be more posi- tive, i.e., it allows the tendon to be drawn quite up to the cornea. 3. Any dropping back or cutting of the thread is minimized in proportion to the degree of divergence, hence magnified in propor- tion as the lines of anchorage approach parallelism. On the other hand, the solidity and security of the anchor- age is increased in propor- tion as its lines become more nearly horizontal, for the reason that the strain of the thread is thus distributed along the sides of the stitch canal, whereas, the more divergent the lines, the more the strain is concentrated at the distal extremity of the canal. These points are illustrated by Fig. 86; aa indicate the further ends of the scleral anchorage, situated at five mm. from the cornea on the vertical meridian. This insures a maximum advancement without contact of the thread with the cornea. Now, in order to give greater firmness to the hold of the thread in the sclera it is not inserted along the lines ea, but is made to follow the lines ca. Still greater lateral strain in the anchorage would be obtained by following the lines c'a, or to make them actually parallel, but this would add greatly to the difficulties of the operation. It would also shorten the anchorage. VM. V.T. Fig. 86.â€”The anchorage cannot Essential that distal portion should be long, be deep.

The corneal incision he made with a stop-lance, similar to the paracentesis knife of Desmarres. The advantage of this instrument over the ordinary keratome is that there is no danger of penetrating too deep, or even, as could happen, to the extent of having the entire blade enter the anterior chamber. De Wecker's Methods of Iridotomy.—In cases of occlusion of the pupil, with presence of the crystalline, he made a corneal in- cision opposite that part of the iris zone where the pupillary border was least adherent. Through this he inserted, closed, the blades of a pair of his scissors, both points of which were blunted. When approaching the pupil, the blades were slightly opened, one of them Fig. 219.—Incisions. Fig. 220.—Result. passed behind the iris, taking care not to wound the lens capsule, the blades still wider opened and pushed further in, a cut made, the in- strument slightly rotated and another cut made, thus loosening a pointed flap, apex inward, like that of Maunior (Figs. 219 and 220). For complete atresia of the iris in aphacic eyes either the point of the keratome, while engaged in the corneal incision, was made to pierce the iris at a suitable spot for inserting the scissors, or else the operator used a pair of scissors, one blade of which was sharp- pointed, and with this the membrane was transfixed. The cut could be single or double. De Wecker's irito-ectomy and irito-dialysis are applicable only to cases of closure of the pupil where the lens is absent. Irito- ectomy is a combination of iridotomy and iridectomy, or, in other words, intraocular iridectomy. In this operation the corneal incision and the primary incision of the iris are made simultaneously

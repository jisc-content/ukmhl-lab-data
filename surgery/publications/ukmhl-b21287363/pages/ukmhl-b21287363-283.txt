These measures may, in occasional instances, be supplemented by the judicious employment of operations for the shortening of the adjacent integument. Among the best of these is that of Panas1 (Fig. 145). The resulting cicatrix corresponds to the natural topography of the region. It is ex- ecuted as follows: two vertical in- cisions, each about one centimeter long, are made through skin and muscle, one near the outer canthus, the other near the inner, their upper extremities close under the cilia. Their lower ends are joined by a horizontal incision through skin only. The flap thus outlined is dissected up to the very roots of the eyelashes, everted and a strip of the premarginal fibres of the orbicularis is excised. A parallelogram is trimmed from the lower edge of the loosened flap, its width proportional to the amount of shortening demanded, and the opening closed by fine sutures. V. Graefe gave a method that has often done good service (Fig. 146). Three millimeters from and par- allel with the free border, an incision is made through skin and muscle, extending nearly the entire length of the lid. A triangle of skin, whose base rests on the middle of the first incision, and whose size is governed by the degree of effect aimed at, is excised—muscle not included. The strip 1 Mem., These de Paris, 1873. Fig. 146 —Graefe's operation for entropion.

141 EXTIRPATION OF THE LACRIMAL SAC. is useless or worse. Here is where electrolysis finds an application. Indeed, we have here a form of operative treatment that will often enable us to relieve obstinate epiphora, and in a surprisingly short time, when nothing else would be of any avail. The toughest strictures seem to melt like wax before the electrically charged sound. For a description of the method and the instrument, I here give a translation from Baudry.1 "Preliminary Dilatation of the Lower Punctum with the Conical Stylet.—An antiseptic injection is useful to disinfect the field of operation. A convenient supply of electricity is necessary. The electrolytic sound of Lagrange (Fig. 57), No. 1 or 2, is passed into the nasal canal. The upper part of this sound is covered with a Fig. 57. casing of non-conducting material, to protect the canaliculus and sac, while the lower portion, uninsulated for a distance of two centimeters, is in contact with the nasal canal. The sound is connected with the negative pole of a battery furnished with the galvanometer aperiodique (of Chardin) or any practical one, the positive electrode being inserted, wrapped in a wad of cotton, satu- rated with salt solution, in the inferior meatus of the nose, and held immovable. The current is regulated by a rheostat (Bergonie's is mentioned). The current passes slowly and steadily from noughts up to 5 milliamperes, remains at this for three to five minutes, then returns again by insensible degrees to noughts. These sittings, which are not at all painful, are repeated two, three, or four times, according to the case. As soon as the sound is removed, anther antiseptic injection is made." Extirpation of the Lacrimal Sac.—This is a comparatively recent surgical measure. True, nearly two hundred years ago Planter tried an excision of the sac combined with an attempt to establish a permanent fistula connecting the conjunctival sac '"Technique Operatoire," 1902.

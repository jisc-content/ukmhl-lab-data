28l ECTROPION AND BLEPHAROPLASTY. thai the lid in this variety of ectropion does not so much incline to inversion of the tarsus as to a festooning or sagging downward of the free border, constitutes one of its most distinctive features. In other words, in cases of long-standing senile ectropion, the lower lid becomes so elongated that it is impossible for it to coapt nicely with the globe, even if the original cause of the ectropion were no longer active. This peculiarity was noticed by physicians in the early days of modern medicine and the first operations con- ceived for righting the defect were directed to this fullness.

This surgeon was bold enough to excise a gore from the very center of the lid (its size regulated by the amount of surplus in the lid) that included the whole thickness. To hold the edges of the notch in apposition, he put in, as near as practicable to the border, a surgical pin, on to which was wound a figure-of-8 ligature. For the rest, fine inter- rupted sutures (Fig. 150). Von Amnion,* 1101 satisfied with the cleft often, and the conspicu- ous scar always, left in the middle of the lid, took the gore from the outer canthus (Von Ammon-Adams operation) (Fig. 151), then proceeded as did Adams; yet not, as has been stated in some text- books, as did Walther,3 who included the outer extremities of both 1 Practical Obs. on Ectrop., 181 2, p. 4. 2 Zeits. f.

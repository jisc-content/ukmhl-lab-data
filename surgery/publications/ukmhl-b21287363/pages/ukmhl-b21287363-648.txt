THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. 638 "The tube-holder contains the usual cylindrical lead glass shield for protecting the operator from the action of the rays, with the customary lead diaphragm. The central orifice of the diaphragm is covered with aluminum, which offers little obstruction to the rays, but lessens the risk of any unfavorable action of the rays upon the patient and guards against possible damage to the eyes in the event of breakage of the tube. The tube-holder slides upon a graduated rod, and the first exposure is made with the indicator at Fig. 284.â€”(Sweet.) zero, in which position the rays pass in a direction corresponding with the horizontal plane of the eyeball. The second exposure is made with the tube at its farthest point to the right or left of the first position, depending upon which eye is to be examined. The illustration (Fig. 283) gives a view of the complete apparatus. "Since the relative position of the tube in reference to the indicating ball and the photographic plate remains fixed and known, it is readily seen that the direction of the X-rays in passing through the eyeball must follow a definite course, which is always the same for

In order that the ultimate result of an operation for cicatricial entropion, of the kind in question, may be sufficient, not only must the eversion be rectified, but the opening up of the ellipse whereby the correction is brought about, must be so extreme that the border of the operated lid lies considerably beyond that of its fellow. If it be the upper lid, the free border reaches the lower rim of the orbit; it the lower, the lid margin reaches the upper corneal limbus. Sutures are seldom required to maintain the lid in position if these Fig. 188. principles are observed; and when put in may do more harm than good. Neither have I found a place for the excision of a gore from the free border that is so often referred to. Whatever elongation of the edge of the lid that may be present at the moment, will surely disappear in the healing process. Figs. 187, 188 and 189 refer to a case of total ectropion of the lower lid corrected by the author. Here the Wolff graft when taken from the arm measured three by four inches. The elliptical bared space left after righting the lid measured one and one-fourth 20

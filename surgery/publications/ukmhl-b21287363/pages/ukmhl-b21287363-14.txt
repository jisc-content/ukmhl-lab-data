The cilia are washed, and the lids manipulated to empty the Meibomian and other ducts along the free borders. The cilia before extractions and iridectomies are coated by wiping them with cotton wet with benzin, and, lastly, the conjunctival sac is copiously douched with warm boric acid solution. A light boric acid dressing is then put on the eye and fixed by a simple muslin strip tied on diagonally, to be left till the time for the opera- tion arrives. The hair of women is neatly combed back and braided. The nails are manicured and the hands are scrubbed. The patient is taken to the operating room in night clothing, i.e., all ready for bed. The eye is copiously flooded with warm boric or salt solution before, during, and after the operation.

By the latter method, however, aside from its being a far less convenient one than the other, to say nothing of the discomfort to the wearer, there was always more or less danger of having the operator's hands con- taminated by coming in contact with the hair while in the act of

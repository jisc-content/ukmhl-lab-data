EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. 588 designed and employed in operating for anterior staphyloma. It was nothing more nor less than an actual transverse section of the cornea, lying exactly in the horizontal meridian, and extending from base to base (Fig. 260). And, by the way, this was the only true linear cut that was ever made for such a purpose. Kuchler called it Querextraktion. Although a very poor surgical measure, its name serves to perpetrate a passable English pun. Liebreich's1 Incision.—This was a modification of the v. Graefe linear incision, made downward, and with the narrow knife (Fig. 261). Puncture and counterpuncture were made about two Fig. 260. Fig. 261. Fig. 262. Kuchler, 1868. Liebreich, 1872. Ed. Jaeger, 1873. millimeters below the horizontal meridian and one millimeterbackof the corneal base. The edge was directed downward and forward, cutting in a gentle curve, and coming out two or three millimeters above the lower limbus. The iridectomy was omitted. Jaeger's2 Incision.—Edward Jaeger, of Vienna, with the idea of accomplishing the Graefe peripheral linear incision by a single for- ward cutting movement, as his grandfather, Beer, made the Daviel large flap, constructed a pair of knives, or as he called them, Hohl- messers, one for the right eye and the other for the left (Plate IX, No. 15). If flattened out, their blades would have been like the Beer knife only longer and narrower. Instead of being flat, however, they were concavo-convex in their sagittal planes; and, in order to conform to the curve of the Graefe incision, they were introduced with the concavity forward (see Fig. 262). They proved to be 1 Liebreich. Eine neue Methode der Cataract Operation, Berlin, 1872. Also Saint Thomas Hospital Reports, vol. ii, p. 259. 2 Der Hohlschnitt. Vienna V. 80, p. 23, 1873.

Aside from those already mentioned as to position and extent, the most important has reference to the configuration, and may be thus concisely stated: Let there be the leas possible difference between the sizes of the inner and outer wound openings (the minimum length of "wound-canal," as the Germans call it). How to accomplish this result? The briefest answer to this O .3 Fig. 268.â€”OO. Optic axis. B B. Plane of corneal base. LL. Linear incision. PP. Positive inclination. NN.

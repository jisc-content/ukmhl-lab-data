282 ECTROPION. lids for the correction of double, i.e., upper and lower, ectropion (Fig. 152). It has been urged against these operations, when made at the outer canthus, that the site is situated too far from the point most desirable to effect, viz., the vicinity of the punctum. Certainly, those made in the center have as many faults. Of later years, Kuhnt1 has given still another modifica- tion of the original Adams operation. The accompany- ing illustrations, taken from Terrien's excellent work on eye surgery, will describe the method better than words (Figs. 153 and 154). Fig. 151.—Von Anion's modification of Adam's It will be Seen that the skin operation for ectropion. fe ^ induded wkh the tri. angle cut from the tarsus and conjunctiva. While there is no doubt of the ability of the operation, in many instances, to relieve the ectropion, there is the risk of the cutting through of the marginal sutures, and the leaving of a permanent nick. Then, too, the decided folding of the skin at the border is objectionable. L. M tiller2 sought to remedy these shortcomings—and not without a degree of success—by altering Kuhnt's method, as per the illustrations (Figs. 155 and 156), also taken from Terrien. The sutures that close the widest part of the tarsal V are held on one side by skin, and the slack of the latter, instead of being taken up in one pleat, is divided among several. Heembold,3 in order to obviate the tuck of skin made at the center of the lid in the Kuhnt operation, removes a triangle of skin corresponding to that of the 1 Beitrage z. operativ.

RESECTION OF THE OUTER WALL OF THE ORBIT. 603 from within outward, and to use only the corner of the chisel, and very slight taps of the hammer, else the bone will be shivered, or the chisel will break through and wound the structures beyond. The aim is also to neatly cut the periosteum covering the outer side of the wedge at the same time. Care must be exercised here or the cut may go too high and enter the cranial cavity. The lower cut is made next, beginning on the malar, about 3 centimenters below the be- ginning of the upper cut, and running almost horizontally back- FlG. 275.â€”The heavy black lines show bone cuts. ward to the spheno-maxillary fissure. The forward end of the fissure reached, the cut may be extended to the apex of the wedge with strong scissors. There should be no dissection of the soft parts from the outer surface of the wedge of resected bone. Now, the whole flap, made up of soft tissues and detached bone, is ready to be swung back out of the way. All that stands in the way of getting at the orbital contents is the wall of periosteum that had lined the inner aspect of the wedge. This is cut with blunt-pointed scissors along the lower border of the external rectus, back of the apex of the wedge, and the two leaves are held out of the way with

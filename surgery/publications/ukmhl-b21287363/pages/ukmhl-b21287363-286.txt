278 ECTROPION. of a transient exophthalmos. Should it be from a more lasting but benign and reducible exophthalmos, median tarsorrhaphy would likely be the most eligible recourse (p. 222). Mucous ectropion of the lower lid will, in most instances, yield to local medical treatment, together with adhesive or collodionized strips to support the lid, and bandaging. Failing in this, one would far better try one of the simpler surgical procedures, such as the insertion of a Snellen1 suture, rather than the employ- ment of more radical measures, or resort to such irrational and primitive methods as cauterization or excision of the offending conjunctiva. An excellent means of holding up a sagging lower lid for an extended period, as well as for the better closure of the palpebral fissure in certain cases of lagophthalmos, is by the use of the contrivance in- vented by the writer for the coaptation of shin-wounds in general surgery.2 Fig. 147 ^Snellen's suture for ectropion. This Consists of a Strip of tarlatan ribbon, near one selvage of which is attached a row of tiny flattened hooks, similar in shape to those employed in connection with "eyes." A strip of this is fastened, by flexible collodion, hooks up, to the lower lid; and another, hooks down, to the brow. The two are then laced, with a suitable cord, the lids approximated as nearly as desired, and the cord tied in a bowknot. The Snellen Suture.—A No. 2 braided thread of silk, boiled in paraffin and armed with two curved needles, is gotten ready. The eye is cocainized. The needles are passed down into the most ■Van Gils Beitrage, p. 90, Utrecht, 1870. 2 Described in a paper read before the Chicago Medical Society, and pub- lished in the Medical Recorder for June, 1903.

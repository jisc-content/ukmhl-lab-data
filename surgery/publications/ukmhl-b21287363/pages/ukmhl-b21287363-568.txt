56o EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. is sharp for only six or eight millimeters from the point. With this, wounding of the iris and needless cutting of the base of the cornea with undue escape of aqueous are avoided. The illumination is either daylight or artificial, focused on the eye through a large lens. A drop or two of 4% cocain solution is instilled, and after a wait of five minutes the blepharostat is put in place, the eye is flooded with warm boric acid solution, the excess of which is sponged away. Fig. 247.â€”Discission. A good firm hold is taken of conjunctiva and episclera with the fixation forceps close to the limbus on the nasal side; the knife is made to perforate the cornea (edge toward the operator) exactly in the outer sclero-corneal junction, encroaching even on the con- junctiva, in the same manner as in making the puncture for flap extraction (Fig. 247). It is pushed in, following the plane of the corneal base, until the point is opposite the center of the pupil, when, if it be the first discission in the case, the handle is raised and the center of the capsule merely punctured. If not the first, the

Two horizontal, parallel incisions, each one-half inch long, are made through the skin, one just below and the other just above the middle of the eye- brow, and the two are joined by tunneling under, one two parallel incisions are carried downward apart, to within one-eighth inch of the cilia. Fig. no. From the lower one-quarter inch The vertical strip of skin thus outlined is dissected loose down to its base, a double- armed suture is put into its free end, and it is wrapped round a cylinder of gauze or cotton wet with warm normal salt solution. From the at- tached extremity of this flap two cuts are made, one outward, the other inward, parallel with the free border of the upper lid, to end at points directly above the canthi—through skin and orbicularis. The canthal ends of these cuts are then joined by an incision made which corresponds to the upper border of the The two triangles Fig. hi along the sulcus tarsus. This also includes skin and orbicularis, of skin and the crescent of muscle so formed are dissected out, leaving the tarsus exposed. Now, the needles attached to the

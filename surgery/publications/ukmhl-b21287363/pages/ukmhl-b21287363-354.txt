OPERATIONS UPON THE CONJUNCTIVA. 346 7. Then carry these needles downward beneath the loosened conjunctiva lying below the oblique incision made by the scissors. The needles after passing in parallel directions beneath the loosened lower segment of the conjunctiva, until they reach the region of the lower fornix, should then emerge from beneath the conjunctiva at a distance of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch from each other. 8. With the forceps lift up the loosened segment of conjunctiva and gently exert traction upon the free ends of thread, which have emerged from below, and the pterygium will glide beneath the loosened lower segment of conjunctiva, and the threads may then be tightened and tied, while the surplus portions of thread are cut off, leaving enough to facilitate the removal of the threads after proper union has occurred (Fig. 204). It is very important that no incision be made along the upper border of the pterygium, because it would gap and leave a denuded space when downward traction is made upon the pterygium. If the head of the pterygium is very large, it is cut off before the pterygium is drawn down beneath the loosened segment of Fig. 204.â€”McReynold's modification of Desmarres, Sr. conjunctiva. If any overlapping of the cornea occurs, McReynolds simply trims away the offending portion of conjunctiva. This is more a burying than a transplanting of the pterygium. The writer would urge, as a precautionary act of no little impor- tance, that before proceeding to draw the pterygium down into the prepared pocket, the blepharostat (or retractor) be removed. The effect of this instrument is, by its pushing the conjunctiva up

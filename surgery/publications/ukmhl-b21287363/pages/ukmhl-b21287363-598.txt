EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. 59° THE MODERN CORNEAL INCISION. "L'operation de la cataracte, c'est la section."—Terrien. In view of the foregoing considerations, relative to the various forms of the primary incision for the extraction of cataract, it would seem a fitting close to the subject to define just what constitutes a proper section; for it is on this that, in great measure, we rely for success in the operation. What is its particular configuration, extent, and position as most approved at the present time ? We have As regards the proper extent of the incision, or, in other words, its length as measured around the corneal base, there have been no definite limits fixed, nor is it practicable to do so, except approxi- mately. There must be some latitude in the matter. We have seen how very objectionable is a wound too small, yet, how seem- ingly little it matters if it be larger than necessary. Therefore, knowing the uncertainties of the act, one may so begin his section as. to favor the chances of erring on the safe side, i.e., of needless length. The supposed size of the cataract, for example, or the particular difficulties that are apprehended in a given case, of necessity, influence the operator's judgment in selecting the points of puncture and counterpuncture. Manifestly, these two points mark noted some of the faults of the highly peripheral or scleral sections (p. 584) and of those that lie far in the opposite direction (p. 589). It may be stated, then, that an inter- FlG. 266.—Modern incision for cataract. mediate position is desirable; and the one chosen is precisely at the junction of the cornea and the conjunctiva, the direc- tion of the flap being upward — superior keratotomy — and ending with or without a con- junctival flap; the whole sec- tion lying in a plane parallel with that of the base of the cornea (Fig. 266).

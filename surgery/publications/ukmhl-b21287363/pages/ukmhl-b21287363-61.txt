LEECHING. 53 The bleeding having ceased, the cotton is left sticking to the spot. Preparatory to either mode of leeching, the temple is rendered aseptic. Unfortunately, the natural leech cannot be sterilized, but, fortunately, it is naturally a cleanly thing, even if it does live in mud. The most suitable place to apply the leech, either living or artificial, is that which is on a level with the outer canthus, and just external to the outer rim of the orbit. When two or more leeches are applied their heads are placed close together and in a horizontal line. One who is experienced in applying the leech can guide the animal's head accurately to the point selected for the bite by holding its body in the folds of a napkin. The tyro would better use a leech-tube. Into this the leech is dropped, big end first. The mouth is in the small end that is forever reach- ing out. If the leech does not take hold readily, lightly scraping off the epidermis with a scalpel or putting a drop of milk on at the spot will induce it to do so. Having once begun to draw blood, it is allowed to remain attached till it falls off. The used, or "stripped" leech is never so good as a fresh one. There are several kinds of artificial leeches. The one bearing the name of Baron Heurteloup is still the favorite. Recently the elaborate scari- fier that formerly went with it has been omitted. The leech is shown in Fig. 32. It consists of a metallic piston with asbestos packed head fitting very tightly in a glass cylinder and worked by a thumb-screw. The skin is scarrified at the point indicated for the leech-bite, the free end of the cylinder is moistened, applied to the part, and the air gradually exhausted by turning the screw. The relief and the improvement that result from leeching are often re- markable, though not usually immediate; from 6 to 24 hours may elapse before the benefits are apparent. It is difficult, therefore, to conceive of the modus operandi. Can it be the mere topic depletion

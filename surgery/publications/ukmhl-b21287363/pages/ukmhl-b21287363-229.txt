2 21 EXTERNAL TARSORRHAPHY. Fig. 94.â€”External tarsorrhaphy the fissure, as first practiced by Walther, was frequently resorted to previous to the invention of the median method. It was done by "scalping" the lids or excising strips of skin containing the follicles of the cilia (Fig. 04) from the outer canthus for varying dis- tances inward, owing to the degree of closure desired and uniting the raw edges by sutures. The method is still resorted to, at times, as a permanent feature, especially in connection with operations for the correction of ectropion of the lower lid, from laxness, and with eversion of the punctum; but it should never be done if one expects later to undo the work. Fuchs is the author of a method of external tarsorrhaphy that could be converted into internal, and which is characterized by great solidity of the union produced be- tween the lids (Fig. 95). Briefly, it is thus: beginning at the outer canthus and extending inward the desired distance, an intermar- ginal incision is made, whereby the lid is split for a depth of five or six millimeters into tarsal and cutaneous leaves. At the inner end of the slit a vertical incision is made in the skin half that extends to the bot- tom of the slit to allow the latter to gape. Correspond- ing incisions are made in the upper lid with the addition of a second perpendicular inci- sion in the skin half at the canthus. The upper extremi- ties of the two vertical cuts are joined by an incision, and the parallelogram thus outlined, and which contains the hair bulbs, is excised. A double-armed suture is passed from within outward at Fig. 95.

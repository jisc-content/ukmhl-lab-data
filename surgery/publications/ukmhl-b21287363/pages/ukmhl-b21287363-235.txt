OPERATIONS FOR EPICANTHUS RHINORRAPHY. 227 method:.is also a good one, and for it Knapp's small sutures and collodion may be utilized. The extra scar is hidden by the specta- cles which the subjects of epicanthus usually require. I would suggest trying the omission of the rhinorraphy and, in lieu thereof, the injection of paraffin, to build up the bridge of the nose, which in these cases is flat, and careful and studied resection of the epicanthal folds, free undermining of the cut edges, hne, in- terrupted sutures, and the support of gauze, wet with flexible col- lodion. Of course, every precaution must be taken to keep this collodion from entering the palpebral fissures. None but those with skill and experience in the prosthetic employment of paraffin should attempt such use of it on account of the dangers from paraffin embolism. It must be remembered, too, that the mass of paraffin that is put into the tissues has a treacherous way of sometimes changing its form and its location. The results of epicanthus operations are seldom beautiful, whatever the method, because of the usual accompanying congenital anomalies, such as ptosis, microphthalmos, squint, etc.

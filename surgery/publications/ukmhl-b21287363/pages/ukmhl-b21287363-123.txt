MODES OF GRASPING INSTRUMENTS. the handle is grasped, and by them it is rotated—solely, as concerns its long axis, and partly as regards the other axes. To these ends, the two are placed more directly opposite, even in the so-called pen-holder grasp, than they are in writing—many times di- rectly opposite, with their pulps applied—and the medius plays a de- cidedly secondary part Fig. 43-Pen-holder in both holding and guiding (Fig. 43). Its functions are to lightly support the grasp and to give an occasional touch in guid- ance. Rotations of the handle, on its transverse axes, are accom- plished in great measure by turning the entire fore- arm, though it is surprising to what an extent trained fingers can effect these movements also. The wrist-joint — i.e., whole- hand movement—is called Fig. 44-In extraction right. ^ requisition much less often in ophthalmic than it is in general surgery. Upper-arm movements are to be limited, but in no way restricted. Detailed specification as to the exact manner of holding and directing each of the in- struments with handles would, without practical demonstration, be only tedious and confusing. More can be ascertained relative to the grasp by looking at the accompany- ing illustrations, than by written descriptions (Figs. 44 and 45). Besides, many points in the manipulations, peculiar to individual operations, are given in connection with the technic Fig. 45.—In extraction left.

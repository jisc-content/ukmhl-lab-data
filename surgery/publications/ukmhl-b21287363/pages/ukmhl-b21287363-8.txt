PREFACE. vi handling of foreign bodies in the eye is a subject apart, the methods employed in their diagnosis, localization, and extraction involving so much that is not in line with other branches of ophthalmic surgery. In view of the fact that the illustrations have been chiefly the fruits of his individual labor, the writer begs his confreres not to consider them in the light of mere pictures or from the stand- point of artists, but as conceptions of how these things should appear by one with considerable experience in the matters de- picted and with a little facility in the power of delineation. In closing, the author offers his sincere thanks to all others who have been instrumental in supplying whatever of merit this volume contains. Charles H. Beard. Chicago, 1910.

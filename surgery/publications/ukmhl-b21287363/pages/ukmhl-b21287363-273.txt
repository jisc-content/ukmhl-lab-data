265 ORGANIC OR CICATRICIAL ENTROPION. should sink in till its epithelium is lower than the surrounding lid margin. The position of the incision is in the posterior portion of the substance of the tarsus, rather hugging the boundary between tarsus and conjunctiva; it is about four millimeters in depth, and is made to gape widely that one may judge of its capacity. The lid is now turned back into place. I Fig. 138.—Making the inter-marginal incision fur mucous graft. Third step. The Cutaneous Incision.—A broad lid spatula is pushed into the upper fornix and held by an aid (Fig. 139). With the same scalpel an incision is made through skin and muscle just below, and parallel with, the upper border of the tarsus, except near the extremities where it takes a horizontal direction, extending some- what beyond the vertical line of the canthus in either direction. Its distance from the free border varies with the width of the tarsus. Fourth step. Dissection of the Flaps.—The lower lip of the incision, with its attached portion of the orbicularis, is lifted and

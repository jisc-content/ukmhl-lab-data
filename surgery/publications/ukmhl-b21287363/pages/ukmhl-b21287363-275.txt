ORGANIC OR CICATRICIAL ENTROPION. 267 length of the free border. When the cilia are reached, in careful dissection, one feels the point of the knife vibrate as it chatters in passing over them. Buttonholing at this stage is to be avoided. The upper lip of the incision, with its underlying muscle, is loosened and pushed upward, so as to expose the tarso-orbital fascia (Fig. 141). Fifth step. Resection of the Border Fibres of the Orbicularis.— The instruments are small, mouse- tooth forceps and delicate, blunt- pointed scissors. The upper edge of the muscle clinging to the lower flap is seized with the forceps and neatly excised from end to end in one long strip, the surgeon and the assistant meanwhile taking care of the skin edge to see that it is not nicked and notched. Sixth step. Counter-grooving of the Tarsus.—The operator steadies the tarsus on the spatula, notes the line of greatest prominence of the horizontal ridge corresponding to the gutter on the inner surface, and with the same scalpel incises it. The two cuts needed for this purpose are so inclined that they meet at or near the posterior surface of the tarsus. If the conjunctiva should be slightly wounded in the act, it is of little consequence, though it were better to avoid it. The size of the wedge will depend upon that of the tarsus. The incisions will, of course, not go far beyond the ridge, which is often not so long as the tarsus. The thickness of the wedge is usually about two millimeters. Wilder has devised an apparatus for excising the wedge of tarsus. It consists of a pair of small scalpels fixed in a holder. ()ne move- ment suffices for the excision. The appliance is also used by its originator for cutting the cutaneous intermarginal graft for restora- tion of the lid border. Seventh step. Inserting the Sutures.—One may use the ordinary Fig. 140.—Beard's method for entropion. The heavy black lines show the incisions.

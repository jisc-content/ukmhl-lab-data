SYMBLEPHARON. 1 Graefe-Saemisch, Bd. iii, 1874, S. 431). s operation. cul-de-sac, the operation usually adopted is that of v. Aril.1 Manner of doing it : If the conjunctiva is fast to the cornea, the so-called pterygoid symblepharon, the apex of the adhesion is held with delicate sharp-toothed forceps, and the dissection made with the bulge-edged scalpel. To aid in this step, some surgeons first put a suture through the apex to hold by. If this is clone, the thread should be double-armed and so inserted as to make the loop* lie crosswise, near the tip of the apex, and upon the out- side, so that the same suture may be used at a later stage of the operation. As this means difficulty to avoid cutting the thread, it is better to dispense with the procedure. Having passed the limbus, the dissection is carried on with small, blunt, curved scissors to the very bottom of the cul-de-sac— really farther, as a rule, than to the limits of the fornix. An incision is then made with straight blunt scissors, on either side of the bridle and close to it, from apex to base, if practicable, converging the two near their ends. If the double-armed suture has not already been put into apex as described, this is now done, the pocket at the base of the flap is pulled wide open, the needles inserted at its bottom, brought out through the skin, side by side, and tied over a cylinder of gauze.

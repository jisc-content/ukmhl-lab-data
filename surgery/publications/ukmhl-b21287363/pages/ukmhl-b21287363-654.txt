644 THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. with the findings. It is only necessary to see that the head and the eye remain immovable during the exposure, a fixation apparatus not being necessary. Be it understood that the degree of precision that we have indicated is that obtained geometrically; this is not usually the case when the localization geometrically attained is transformed to conform to the three markers in the anatomic Fig. 288.—Method of Guilloz for localization 288). The head of the of foreign bodies (iron or steel), in the eye. . . , f . through whose center runs the median branch, and carries on its periphery the three upper articulations of the arms that support the other branches. The central branch is a graduated, rectilinear, cylin- drical stem, sliding, with light friction, in a hollow shaft one centi- meter in length. This, at its center, passes through a copper ball to which it is soldered, and which works in a spherical concavity situated partly in the plate and partly in a flange fastened by three screws on top of the plate. A little turn given to one of these screws renders the articulation rigid, by pressure, and permits only the sliding of the graduated branch in its collar. Each lateral arm is biarticulate, the upper extremity being attached to the plate by a ball-and-socket joint similar to that described for the central branch, localization—it may be by reason of the variable dimen- sions of the orbit or it may be owing to the mobility of the eye. The distances of the foreign body from the three guide-marks having been determined, it remains to make the anatomic localiza- tion. This is accomplished with the aid of markers by employing an instrument which is nothing more than a compass with four branches, each of which may be set for whatever inclination or what- ever length is desired (Fig. compass is formed of a plate

21 321 CHAPTER VIII. OPERATIONS UPON THE CONJUNCTIVA. SYMBLEPHARON. Literally, this term means an adhesion or a clinging together of the eyelids In its true sense, however, it refers to a union of the palpebral with the ocular conjunctiva, or to the severer con- dition wherein the lid is firmly adherent to the globe. Among the more frequent causes are burns from lime, molten metal, acids, etc. Owing to gravitation and to the exposed situation of the lower part of the conjunctival sac, it is more often affected than is the upper. The extent of the adherence varies from that of a tiny isolated bridge to that in which all traces of a cul-de-sac are lacking, and the entire inner aspect of the lid is united to the ball. Symble- pharon is designated as outward, inward, upward, and downward, according to its location. For convenience in reference, the different grades are classified as follows: 1. Symblepharon anterius, commonly spoken of as circum- scribed, is the simplest form, and is so named because the junction between the opposing portions of conjunctiva does not reach the fornix. 2. Symblepharon Posterius, Partial Symblepharon.—This class comprises the intermediate grades, or those in which the attach- ment extends to the fornix, but in which the cul-de-sac is not wholly obliterated, nor is there marked cicatrization of the bulbar conjunctiva. 3. Symblepharon Totalis, Complete Symblepharon.—Under this heading are included all the more pronounced cases where the attachment involves the whole of one or both lids, and the cul-de-sac is utterly effaced. In the exaggerated instances there is often ankyloblepharon also. Some authors (Fuchs among them) state that blindness, or at most, quantitative perception of light, is a necessary accompaniment of total symblepharon. This is by no means true of the commonest form, viz., that in which the entire lower lid is grown to the globe, even when, as often happens, the

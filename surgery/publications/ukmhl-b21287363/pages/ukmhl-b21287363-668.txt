THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. 658 the wound, and the track inside of the eye. When the injured eye is on the verge of panophthalmitis, every minute counts. After all, it seems to be pretty generally conceded or implied that localization, scleral incision (if no open wound already exists), and the use of the large magnet constitute the most eligible procedures for most cases of iron or steel in the vitreous chamber. Hirschberg's "Three Principal Causes of the Insuccess of Magnet Operations" read almost like a defense of the large magnet and an accusation of the small. They are: 1. Loss of the eye from inflammatory processes after successful extraction of the foreign body. 2. Insufficient traction power in the magnet. 3. Too firm an anchorage of the metal in its bed. He might have added: 4. Insufficient measures of localization. It must be admitted, however, that in many instances the drawing of the metal from the vitreous into the anterior chamber and its removal thence by means of the hand magnet through an appro- priate incision constitutes a most elegant and satisfactory operation.

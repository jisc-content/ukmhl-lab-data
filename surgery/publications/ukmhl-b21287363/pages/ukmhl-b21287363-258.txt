250 CHAPTER VII. ENTROPION. Entropion, or turning inward of the lid upon the globe, is of two kinds—functional and organic. The evil results of the condi- tion have reference, mainly, to the damaging effects upon the cornea and conjunctiva caused by the contact of the misplaced eyelashes, or trichiasis; though the deformity, and the pressure, and the rubbing of the warped and shrunken tarsi upon the globe, in the worse forms of organic entropion, are alone sufficient reasons for surgical intervention. Functional or spastic entropion usually concerns the lower lid only, and occurs most often in elderly persons in whom the palpebral integument is lax or superabundant. It is then known as senile entropion, and a common cause is the wearing of a bandage. Not infrequently, however, it affects the lower lid of younger sub- jects, when it is accompanied by inflammations of the skin and of the conjunctiva. This form of spasmodic turning in has been called acute entropion. Whatever the cause or the age of the indi- vidual, they are treated about alike; that is, for the transient or less obstinate varieties simple mechanical means are successfully employed, and for the more stubborn, surgical measures are required. If from bandaging, and it is not practicable to leave off the dress- ing, a strip of rubber adhesive plaster five or six centimeters long, by one to one and one-half wide is applied vertically. About one centimeter of the upper end is first made to adhere just below the cilia, pulled downward slightly, to draw the free border away from the eye—not so much as to produce a decided ectropion—then fastened throughout the rest of its extent. If there is any lacrima- tion, the tears soon loosen the plaster, in which event it is better to gently evert the lid and to paint flexible collodion over the region of the lower half of the orbicularis, taking care to close the eye and otherwise protect it from the ether.

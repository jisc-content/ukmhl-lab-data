OPERATIONS UPON THE GLOBE. 438 toward the right, the location of the wound will be where originally planned. The fixation forceps is here removed, provided the eye is under a local anesthetic and the patient tractable. If not, the instrument is given to the assistant. To do this is a delicate matter. The aid lays his hand, palm up, on the patient's face, slides it deftly beneath Fig. 223. that of the operator, and grasps the blades firmly close under the surgeon's fingers. If there be any doubt as to the outcome of the maneuver, the surgeon would better release the forceps from the eye, give them to the aid, and let the latter catch his own hold. Having done so, he watches his forceps, and not the progress of the operation, save that he may know when to let go.

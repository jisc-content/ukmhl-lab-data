COMPARISON OF THE METHODS OF LOCALIZATION. 649 cathode divergent like a cone, the further away the plate, the more magnified, yet the less distinct the shadows and the longer the ex- posure. The center of the anticathode should be in line with the center of the rotation of the exposed eye. To have the subject in the recumbent posture during exposure is conducive to accuracy, as the motions imparted to the head by the heart, in breathing, and by the muscles concerned in equilibrium are then most nearly eliminated. It is advisable to cover the eye not concerned—better still, to bandage it firmly. The patient may lie on the back with the plate bound to the temple and the tube at the opposite side or Fig. 294.—At an inclination of 300. on his side, with the temple on the plate and the tube or tubes directly above. When the foreign body has but recently entered the eye, it may be susceptible of movement in obedience to the laws of gravity. It would then be important that the same position be assumed in exposure and in extraction. The dangers and inconveniences of the X-ray to both examiner and examined should not be ignored. They mainly concern the skin of the operator's hands and the skin and hair of the patient's head. Trophic disturbances are common—brown discoloration, erythema, etc. Gangrene, with subsequent deformity of the fingers, can occur. Comparison of the Methods of Localization.—To put it con- cisely, circumstantial evidence, the patient's statements or those of others, and ocular inspection are all very good as far as they go, but cannot be trusted to any considerable extent. The ophthal- moscope is preferable to any other means, but, unfortunately, it is

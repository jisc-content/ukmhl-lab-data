EXENTERATION OF THE SCLERA. 411 Fage,1 gives the following reasons for suturing scleral wounds: 1. The prevention of deep infection. 2. Holding back the contents of the globe. 3. The avoidance of fistula, cystoid scar, and staphyloma. 4. The resulting scar is more regular, less contracted, and conduces less to detachment of the retina. 5. The healing process is shortened. Czermak2 makes a rule of suturing all scleral wounds that exceed 5 mm. in length. Even the subconjunctival ruptures are sought out, trimmed up, and sutured. If the lens has escaped beneath the con- junctiva, of course it is let out. Ntieb has contrived a most in- genious and effective arrangement of the thread for closing corneo- scleral ruptures, as well as for the wound left after the removal of a cystoid scar in that locality. The suture is double-armed. One needle is quilted into the sub-conjunctival tissue for a distance of 2 centimeters at, and parallel with, the equator, i.e., for a distance of 1 centimeter on either side of the meridian of the wound. The threads are then crossed over the center of the wound, and each needle carried beneath the conjunctiva, in the episclera, close to, and half-way around the cornea, where they are brought out together and tied (Fig. 217). EXENTERATION OF THE SCLERA. (eviseratio bulbi.) Seeing that this operation consists in making an opening in the front wall of the globe and the removal of its entire contents, the author has taken the liberty of classing it among the operations upon the sclera. In this way it can better be kept distinct from the operation of simple incision of all the tunics of the globe; that has 1 Ann. d'ocul., cxii, p. 262, 1894. 2 Augenarztlichen Operationen, p. 690. 3 Ann. d'ocul., xcix, 1888, p. 270.

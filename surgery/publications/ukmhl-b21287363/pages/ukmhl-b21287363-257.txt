249 SUMMARY. surgery will agree that the results of ptosis operations, taken all in all, are far from brilliant. "It is only with precise appreciation of the peculiarities of the individual case, that one may hope to succeed in this delicate, and special surgery of the lid" (Terson). A correct diagnosis as to the character of the ptosis and a nice estimate as to its degree, are pre-requirements to a fortunate issue. The high degrees of congenital ptosis, with inert superior rectus, are the most difficult with which to contend. It is in these that, according to the writer's observation, the greatest good is to be looked for from those surgical measures that do not rely for their success upon a single feature or principle, but upon a well-considered union of two or more. In this manner one is not obliged so to exaggerate a particular step as to risk, for example, the production of unsightly and harmful lagophthalmos, but is enabled to obtain a maximum effect with a minimum disturbance of any one of the several parts involved. For the milder forms of partial ptosis all the measures that have just been described readily give satisfactory results in good hands and in well-selected cases. After all, it is here, just as with surgery in general, that subtle something known as personal equation is a tremendous factor. A chosen few seem to be lucky, whatever the methods they select.

OPERATIONS UPON THE GLOBE. 4o8 chamber. Iridectomy, for the secondary glaucoma of such cases, is not feasible because of the certainty of losing vitreous. Contraindications. Seclusio pupilke, iris bombe, sarcoma of the choroid, or active iritis. Accidents and Complications. Immediate. 1. Failure to cut all of the scleral fibres. The spatula will then go only about i mm. forward. 2. Hemorrhage from cyclon or scleral vessels or ciliary vein. 3. Running of spatula into a good scleral spur. 4. Detachment of Descemet's membrane from the corneal stroma , indicated by corneal cloudiness. 5. Iridodialysis—which is infrequent. 6. Hemorrhage from Schlem's canal, as its inner wall is formed by the ligamentum pectinatum and the fibres of the ligament are broken and split up. Consecutive Accidents.—While the operation is of too recent origin to permit one to judge as to its remote effects, tumors, which are apparently implantation cysts, have been observed to occur at the seat of the operation as early as a few weeks after its performance. Two such cases have been seen by the writer. Results of Cyclodialysis.—Lowering of tension—immediate if aqueous is permitted to escape, gradual if the aqueous is not allowed to escape, so that the maximum effect is not produced until from one to three days after the operation. These results may be permanent or of only a few days' duration. In some cases, especially in absolute glaucoma, there is no improvement at any time. It is not known in just what way these results are produced, whether by establishing an outflow through the peri- choroidal space or through the canal of Schlem. It seems probable, however, that the good results which occasionally follow this procedure are due to freeing the angle of the anterior chamber, and not to permanent choroidal detachment. Excision and Trephination of the Sclera. Sclerectomy. Removal of a portion of the sclera was first undertaken for cystoid scars or staphyloma consequent upon penetrating wounds.

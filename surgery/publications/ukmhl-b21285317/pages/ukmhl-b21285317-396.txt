MUSCLES AND FASCIAE. 228 Styio-hyoid muscles, which assist in preventing the return of the morsel into the mouth. 4. Lingual Region. Genio-Hyo-Glossus. Lingualis. Hyo-Glossus. Stylo-Glossus. Palato-Glossus. Dissection. After completing the dissection of the preceding muscles, saw through tbe lower jaw just external to the symphysis. Then draw the tongue forwards, and attach it, by a stitch, to the nose; and its muscles, which are thus put on the stretch, may be examined." The Gen io-Hi/o-G loss its has received its name from its triple attachment to the jaw, hyoid bone, and tongue; it is a thin, flat, triangular muscle, placed ver- tically on either side of the middle line, its apex corresponding with its point of attachment to the lower jaw, its base with its insertion into the tongue and hyoid bone. It arises by a short tendon from the superior genial tubercle on the inner side of the symphysis of the jaw, immediately above vthe Genio-hyoid; from this point, the muscle spreads out in a fan-like form, the inferior fibres passing down- wards, to be inserted into the upper part of the body of the hyoid bone, a few being continued into the side of the pharynx; the middle fibres passing backwards, and the superior ones upwards and forwards, to be attached to the whole length of the under surface of the tongue, from the base to the apex. 157.â€”Muscles of the Tongue. Left Side. Relations. By its internal surface, it is in contact with its fellow of the opposite side, from which it is separated, at the back part of the tongue, by the fibrous septum, which extends through the middle of the organ. By its external surface, with the Lingualis, Hyo-glossus, and Stylo-glossus, the lingual artery and hypo- glossal nerve, the gustatory nerve, and sublingual gland. By its upper harder, with the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth (frsenum linguae). By its lower border, with the Geniodiyoid. The Hyo-Glossus is a thin, flat, quadrilateral muscle, which arises from the side

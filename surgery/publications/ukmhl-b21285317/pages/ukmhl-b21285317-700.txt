532 CRANIAL NERVES. The communication with the gustatory takes place near the anterior border of the Hyo-glossus muscle by numerous filaments which ascend upon it. The branches of distribution are the Descendens noni. Thyro-hyoid. Muscular. The descendens noni is a long slender branch, which quits the hypoglossal where it turns round the occipital artery. It descends obliquely across the sheath of the carotid vessels, and joins just below the middle of the neck, to form a loop with the communicating branches from the second and third cervical nerves. From the con- vexity of this loop branches pass forwards to supply the Sterno-hyoid, Sterno- thyroid, and both bellies of the Omo-hyoid. According to Arnold, another filament descends in front of the vessels into the chest, and joins the cardiac and phrenic nerves. The descendens noni is occasionally contained in the sheath of the carotid vessels, being sometimes placed over and sometimes beneath the internal jugular vein. The thyro-hyoid is a small branch, arising from the hypoglossal near the posteiior border of the Hyo-glossus; it passes obliquely across the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and supplies the Thyro-hyoid muscle. The muscular branches are distributed to the Stylo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Genio- hyoid, and Genio-hyo-glossus muscles. At the under surface of the tongue, numerous slender branches pass upwards into the substance of the organ.

GEN ERA I. ANATOMY. granular masses ('.primitive or foetal marrow'j, which have heen supposed to be developed out of the large clear cells shown above them in tig. XXIV., and thus to be the descendants of the cartilage-cells. But the view which is now more generally adopted is that the cartilage-cells, after becoming developed into these round clear bodies, are dissolved, and shed then- granular contents to form the calcareous matrix ; while the cells which line the primary areohe, and from which the future bone is developed, and which are on that account called ' osteoblasts,' are furnished by the blood- vessels which are to be found in those spaces. As these blood-vessels advance into the areohe, the latter break down, giving rise to the primary Flu. XXTV.

Region of the dark granular massei medullary canals, which are the rudiments of the Haversian canals. (Fig. XXV.) The osteoblasts are believed to be corpuscles emigrating out of these vessels, and are described by Frey as being differentiated from a mass of lymphoid cells, some of which become developed into connective- tissue fibres, which traverse the hone ; others preserve the old lymphoid form, and may be recognised in thai form during the whole of life in the red marrow; while others possibly form the fat-cells of the yellow marrow. The osteoblasts line the wall of the medullary space like an epithelium. They secrete the bony substance which separates the lacuna' from each other. This appears first as a homogeneous opalescent material, in which

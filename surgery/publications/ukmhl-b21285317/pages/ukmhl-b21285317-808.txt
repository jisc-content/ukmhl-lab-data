640 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. epithelium ; its attached surface is rough, being- connected to the viscera and inner surface of the parietes by means of areolar tissue called the subperitoneal areolar tissue. The parietal portion is loosely connected with the fascia lining the abdomen and pelvis; but more closely to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and in the middle line of the abdomen. In order to get a first general idea of the peritoneum and its reflections, the student should bear in mind that all the abdominal and pelvic viscera are placed ex- ternal to it, and that it is a shut sac superimposed upon the viscera.* Let the student imagine that all the viscera are in their proper positions in the abdominal cavity, but uninvested by peritoneum. Upon the top of them is placed a large closed sac or bladder, the walls of which are of extreme thinness, and wherever there is a cleft between two viscera a process of peritoneum derived from the part of the 357.â€”The Eeflections of tbe Peritoneum, as seen in a vertical Section of the Abdomen. sac in contact with the viscera is tucked in between them, so as to cover the adjacent surfaces of the two viscera and separate them from each other, and at the same time, by becoming adherent to the viscera, form an investment for them. Thus in fig. 357 such a diverticulum or process may be seen tucked in between the under surface of the liver and the upper surface of the stomach, and extending between the two as far backwards as the portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct, which it covers on their anterior surfaces, forming the anterior layer of what is termed the lesser omen- tum, which is a double fold of peritoneum passing downwards from the under sur- face of the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach. The first of these diverticula or processes which must be alluded to, because it is the largest, is one which is tucked * "We may disregard, for the present, the fact that the peritoneum in the female is not an absolutely closed sac, since the Fallopian tubes open into it at their free extremities.

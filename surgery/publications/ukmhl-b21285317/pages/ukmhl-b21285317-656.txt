488 NERVOUS SYSTEM. The corpus callosum terminates at the base of the brain by a concave margin, which is connected with the tuber cinereum through the intervention of a thin layer of grey substance, the lamina cinerea. This may be exposed by gently raising and drawing back the optic commissure. A broad white band may be observed on each side, passing from the under surface of the corpus callosum backwards and outwards, to the commencement of the fissure of Sylvius ; these bands are called the 2}eduncles of the corpus callosum. Laterally, the corpus callosum extends into the anterior lobe. The lamina cinerea. is a thin layer of grey substance, extending backwards above the optic commissure from the termination of the corpus callosum to the tuber cinereum; it is continuous on either side with the grey matter of the anterior 272.â€”Base of the Brain. perforated space, and forms the anterior part of the inferior boundary of the third ventricle. It connects the genu, or reflected portion, of the corpus callosum with the optic commissure, and is on this account described by Sappey as the grey root of the optic nerves. The olfactory nerve, with its bulb, is seen on either side of the longitudinal fissure, upon the under surface of each anterior lobe. The fissure of Sylvius separates the anterior and middle lobes, and lodges the middle cerebral artery. At its commencement is seen a point of medullary sub- stance, corresponding to a subjacent band of white fibres, connecting the frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes, and called the fasciculus unciformis; on following this fissure outwards, it divides into two branches, which enclose the triangular-

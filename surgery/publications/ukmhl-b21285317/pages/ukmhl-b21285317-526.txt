ARTERIES 353 The muscular branches, two in number, superior and inferior, supply the muscles of the eyeball. The superior, the smaller, often wanting, supplies the Levator palpebrse, Superior rectus, and Superior oblique. The inferior, more constant in 218.—The Arteries of the Base of the Brain. The right half of the Cerebellum and Pons have been removed. N.B.—It will he noticed that in the illustration the two anterior cerebral arteries have been drawn at a considerable distance from each other; this makes the anterior communi- cating artery appear very much longer than it really is. its existence, passes forwards, between the optic nerve and Inferior rectus, and is distributed to the External and Inferior recti, and Inferior oblique. This vessel gives off most of the anterior ciliary arteries.

SPINAL NERVES. 562 inner surface of the Obturator interims ; the branch to the Gemellus superior arises from the lower part of the plexus, near the pudic nerve; the small branch to the Gemellus inferior and Quadratus femoris also arises from the lower part of the plexus: it passes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and courses down beneath the Gemelli and tendon of the Obturator internus, and supplies the muscles on their deep or anterior surface. It gives off an articular branch to the hip-joint. This branch is occasionally derived from the upper part of the great sciatic nerve. The Superior Gluteal Nerve (fig. 308) arises from the back part of the lumbo- sacral cord ; it passes from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen above the Pyriformis muscle, accompanied by the gluteal vessels, and divides into a superior and an inferior branch. The superior branch follows the line of origin of the Gluteus minimus, and supplies it and the Gluteus medius. The inferior branch crosses obliquely between the Gluteus minimus and medius, distributing filaments to both these muscles, and terminates in the Tensor vaginae femoris, extending nearly to its lower end. The Pudic Nerve arises from the lower part of the sacral jjlexus, and leaves the pelvis, through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the Pyriformis. It then crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-enters the jielvis through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. It accompanies the pudic vessels upwards and forwards along the outer wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia, and divides into two terminal branches, the perineal nerve, and the dorsal nerve of the penis. Near its origin, it gives off the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve. The inferior hemorrhoidal nerve is occasionally derived from the sacral plexus. It passes across the ischio-rectal fossa, with its accompanying vessels, towards the lower end of the rectum, and is distributed to the integument round the anus. Branches of this nerve communicate with the inferior pudendal and superficial peri- neal nerves at the forepart of the perinseum. The perineal nerve, the inferior and larger of the two terminal branches of the pudic, is situated below the pudic artery. It accompanies the superficial perineal artery in the perineum, dividing into cutaneous and muscular branches. The cutaneous branches (superficial perineal) are two in number, posterior and anterior. The posterior branch passes to the fore part of the ischio-rectal fossa, distributing filaments to the Sphincter ani and integument in front of the anus, which communicate with the inferior hsemorrhoidal nerve ; it then passes forwards, with the anterior branch, to the back of the scrotum, communicating with the anterior branch and with the inferior pudendal. The anterior branch passes to the fore part of the ischio-rectal fossa, in front of the preceding, and accompanies it to the scrotum and under part of the penis. This branch gives one or two filaments to the Levator ani. The muscular branches are distributed to the Transversus perinei, Accelerator urinae, Erector penis, and Compressor urethras. The nerve of the bulb supplies the corpus spongiosum ; some of its filaments run for some distance on the surface before penetrating to the interior. The dorsal nerve of the penis is the superior division of the pudic nerve; it accompanies the pudic artery along the ramus of the ischium, piercing the posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, it runs forwards along the inner margin of the ramus of the pubes, between the two layers of the deep fascia. It then pierces the anterior layer, and in company with the dorsal artery of the penis, passes through the suspensory ligament and running forwards is distributed to the glans. On the penis, this nerve gives off a cutaneous branch, which runs along the side of the organ ; it is joined with branches of the sympathetic, and supplies the integument of the upper surface and sides of the penis and prepuce, giving a large branch to the corpus cavernosum. In the female, the pudic nerve is distributed to the parts analogous to those in the male; its superior division terminating in the clitoris, its inferior in the external labia and perineum.

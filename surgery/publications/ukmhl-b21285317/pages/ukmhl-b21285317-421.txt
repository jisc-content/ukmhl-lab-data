OF THE ABDOMEN. 253 border at the liuea alba; the anterior layer is blended with the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle; the posterior layer with that of the Transversalis. Along the lower fourth, the aponeurosis passes altogether in front of the Rectus without any separation. Relations. By its external surface, with the External oblique, Latissimus dorsi, spermatic cord, and external ring. By its internal surface, with the Transversalis muscle, fascia transversalis, internal ring, and spermatic cord. Its lower border forms the upper boundary of the spermatic canal. 169.â€”The Transversalis, Rectus, and Pyramidalis Muscles. Dissection. Detach the Internal oblique in order to expose the Transversalis beneath. This may be effected by dividing' the muscle, above, at its attachment to the ribs; below, at its connection with Poupart's ligament and the crest of the ilium; and behind, by a vertical incision extending- from the last rib to the crest of the ilium. The muscle should previously be made tense by drawing upon it with the fingers of the left hand, and if its division is carefully effected, the cellular interval between it and the Transversalis, as well as the direction of the fibres of the latter muscle, will afford a clear guide to their separation ; along the crest of the ilium the circumflex iliac vessels are interposed between them, and form an important guide in separating them. The muscle should then be thrown forwards towards the liuea alba.

cx GENERAL ANATOMY. the epidermis) is that of protection. As the surface is worn away by the agency of friction or change of temperature, new cells are supplied, and thus the surface of the true skin, and the vessels and nerves which it contains, are defended from damage. In the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane and in the glands, the epithelial cells appear to be the principal agents in separating the secretion from the blood or from the alimentary fluids. In other situations (as the nose, fauces, and respiratory passages) the chief office of the epithelial cells appears to be to maintain an equable temperature Fig. LXVII.—Epithelial cells in the oral cavity of man.

In the serous cavities they also keep the opposed layers moist, and thus facilitate their movements on each other. Finally, in all internal parts they ensure a perfectly smooth surface. The epithelium is usually spoken of as tesselated or pavement, columnar, spheroidal or glandular, and ciliated. The pavement epithelium is composed of fiat nucleated scales of various shapes, usually polygonal, and varying in size. These scales often contain granules, as in fig. LXVII. This kind of epithelium is found on the Fig. LXVIII.—Epithelium of the intestinal villi of the rabbit. Magnified 300 times. a.

The nails, hairs, and in animals the horns, are a variety of this kind of epi- thelium. * The epithelium lining the blood-vessels, lymphatics, and serous membranes is modified in shape, and its cells vary much in size. It is usually spoken of in German works aa endothelium. It is represented in lig. LVIL

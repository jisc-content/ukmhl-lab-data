Thus it will be seen that the greater bulk of the white matter of the cord is made up of longitudinal medullated fibres, which are arranged in groups forming the anterior, lateral, and posterior columns. There are, however, also oblique and transverse fibres in the white substance. These are principally found (i) at the bottom of the anterior Fig. XLIII.â€”Transverse section through the cervical portion of the spinal cord of a calf. Magnified 40 diameters.

The white matter of the cord, subdivided by septa of connective tissue, s, extending from the pia mater to the grey matter, which is seen in the interior with its ganglion-cells. The dots around this show divided nerve-fibres, which exist, but are not shown, in the other parts of the white substance. The central canal is seen m the grey matter. median fissure, forming the anterior commissure ; the fibres passing from the grey matter of the anterior horn on one side to the white matter of the anterior column of the opposite side ; (2) horizontal or oblique fibres passing from the roots of the nerves into the grey matter ; and (3) fibres leaving the grey matter and pursuing a longer or shorter horizontal course between the bundles of longitudinal fibres with which many of them are continuous.

The large trunk formed by the union of these branches ascends along the right side and in front of the corresponding artery, passes in front of the transverse portion of the 252.—Portal Vein and its Branches. duodenum, and unites behind the upper border of the pancreas with the splenic vein to form the vena portse. It receives the right gastro-epiploic vein. The splenic vein commences by five or six large brunches, which return the * Besides this anastomosis between the portal vein and the branches of the vena cava, other anastomoses between the portal and systemic veins are formed by the communication between the gastric veins and the oesophageal veins which empty themselves into the vena azygos minor, between the left renal vein and the veins of the intestines, especially of the colon and duodenum, and between superficial branches of the portal veins of the liver and the phrenic veins, as pointed out by Mr. Kiernan (Todd and Bowman).

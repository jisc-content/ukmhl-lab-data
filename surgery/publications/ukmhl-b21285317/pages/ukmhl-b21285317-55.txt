ADIPOSE TISSUE. xlvii Fig. XII.—Retiform connective tissue, from the cortical part of a lymphatic gland. Two special kinds of cellular tissue must be described—the mucoid, and the lymphoid or retiform. The mucoid or gelatinous tissue exists chiefly in the 'jelly of Wharton,' which forms the bulk of the umbilical cord, and in some other tissues of the foetus; in the adult body also the vitreous humour of the eye is formed of gelatinous cellular tissue. This tissue is formed of nucleated cells which branch and be- come connected so as to form trabecular, in which is contained a jelly-like substance. Some- times, as in the vitreous humour of the eye, the cells disappear and the jelly only remains. Retiform, adenoid, or lymphoid (Fig. XII.) connective tissue is found extensively in many parts of the body, often surrounding the minute blood-vessels, and forming the commencement of lymphatic channels. It is formed of an interlacement of very fine fibres, at the nodal points of which stellate cells are situated. The interstices of the fibres are filled with the rounded granular corpuscles of the lymph. The neuroglia, or fine gelatinous connective tissue which supports the nervous elements in the cerebro-spinal axis and in the retina, is regarded as a modified form of the retiform connective tissue. ADIPOSE TISSUE. The common cellular membrane contains a variable quantity of adipose tissue. This tissue is found also in various parts of the viscera—as the mesentery, the surface of the heart, &c.—and fat enters largely into the Fig. XIII.—Adipose tissue. High power. a.

Adipose tissue consists of a number of vesicles formed by an extremely delicate stractureless membrane, round or spherical where they have not been

TO THE PREFACE TENTH EDITION. rpHIS EDITION has undergone a careful revision ; and several portions, especially in the sections on Microscopical Anatomy, have been considerably altered or entirely rewritten, in order to keep pace with the ever-increasing activity of research in this branch of the science of Anatomy. Several new illustrations have been added, and some of the old ones have been replaced by others. The Editor has to acknowledge, with his warmest thanks, the valuable assistance he has received from his friend Mr. Ross, Curator of the Museum of St. George's Hospital, and lately Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy, who has not only prepared all the dissections from which the new illustrations have been drawn, but has also bestowed a large amount of labour in investigating certain points in Anatomy about which there is a difference of opinion in the various text-books on the subject. The Editor's best thanks are also due to Mr. Compton, Demonstrator of Histology at St. George's Hospital, for the great care and trouble which he has taken in drawing the new micro- scopical illustrations which have been introduced into the present edition.

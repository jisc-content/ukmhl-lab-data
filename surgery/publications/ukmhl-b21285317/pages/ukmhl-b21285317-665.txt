497 THE FORNIX. The anterior crura of the fornix are connected in their course with the optic com- missure, the white fibres covering the optic thalamus, the peduncle of the pineal gland, and the superficial fibres of tbe taenia semicircularis. The posterior crura, at their commencement, are intimately connected by their upper surfaces with the corpus callosum • diverging from one another, they pass downwards into the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, being continuous with the concave border of the hippocampus major. The lateral thin edges of the posterior crura have received the name of corpus fimbriatum, already described. On the under surface of the fornix, towards its posterior part, between the diverging posterior crura, may be seen some transverse lines, and others, longitudinal or oblique. This appearance has been termed the lyra, from the fancied resemblance it bears to the strings of a harp. 277.—The Third and Fourth Ventricles. Between the anterior pillars of the fornix and the anterior extremities of the optic thalami, an oval aperture is seen on each side, the foramen of Monro (fig. 277). The two openings descend towards tbe middle line, and, joining together, lead into the upper part of the third ventricle. These openings communicate with the lateral ventricles on each side, and below with the third ventricle. Divide the fornix across anteriorly, and reflect the two portions, the one forwards, the other backwards, when the velum interpositum will be exposed. The velum interpositum (fig. 276) is a vascular membrane, reflected from the pia mater into the interior of the brain through the transverse fissure, passing beneath the posterior rounded border of the corpus callosum and fornix, and above the corpora quadrigemina, pineal gland, and optic thalami. It is of a triangular form, and separates the under surface of the body of the fornix from the cavity of the K K

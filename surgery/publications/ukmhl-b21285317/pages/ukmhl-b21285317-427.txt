DIAPHRAGM. s 2 ?59 are performed mainly by the flat muscles (Obliqui and Transversalis) of the abdomen, assisted also by the Rectus. Other muscles of forced expiration are the Internal intercostals and Triangularis sterni (as above mentioned), the Serratus posticus inferior, the Quadratns lumboi'um, and the Sacro-luinbalis. Diaphragmatic Region. Diaphragm. The Diaphragm (Std<l>p<tyfj.a, a partition wall) (fig. 171) is a thin musculo-fibrous septum, placed obliquely at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the trunk, and separating the thorax from the abdomen, forming the floor of the former cavity and the roof of the latter. It is elliptical, its longest diameter being from side to side, somewhat fan-shaped, the broad elliptical portion being horizontal, the narrow part, which represents the handle of the fan, vertical, and joined at right 171.â€”The Diaphragm, Under Surface. angles to the former. It is from this circumstance that some anatomists describe it as consisting of two portions, the upper or great muscle of the Diaphragm, and the lower or lesser muscle. It arises from the whole of the internal circumference of the thorax, being attached, in front, by fleshy fibres to the ensiform cartilage; on either side, to the inner surface of the cartilages and bony portions of the six or s^vgn^ijvferior libs, intercligitating with the Transveisalis; and behind, to two aponeurotic arches, named the ligamentum arcuatum externum and internum, and to the lumbarjvert_ebra3. The fibres from these sources vary in length ; those aris- ing from the ensiform appendix are very short and occasionally aponeurotic; those from the ligamenta arcuata, and more especially those from the ribs at the side of the chest, are longer, describe well-marked curves as they ascend, and finally con- verge to be inserted into the circumference of the central tendon.

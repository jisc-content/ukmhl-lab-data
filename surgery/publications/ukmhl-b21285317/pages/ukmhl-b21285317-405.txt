237 LATERAL VERTEBRAL REGION. muscle separates the subclavian artery and vein : the latter being in front, and the former, with the brachial plexus, behind. Relations. In front, with the clavicle, the Subclavius, Sterno-mastoid, and Omo-hyoid muscles, the Transversalis colli, and ascending cervical arteries, the subclavian vein, and the phrenic nerve. By its posterior surface, with the pleura, the subclavian artery, and brachial plexus of nerves. It is separated from the Longus colli, on the inner side, by the vertebral artery. The Scalenus Medius, the largest and longest of the three Scaleni, arises, by a broad origin, from the upper surface of the first rib, behind the groove for the subclavian artery, as far back as the tubercle; and, ascending along the side of the vertebral column, is inserted, by separate tendinous slips, into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the lower six cervical vertebra?. It is separated from the Scalenus anticus by the subclavian artery below, and the cervical nerves above. The posterior thoracic, or nerve of Bell, is formed in the sub- stance of the Scalenus medius and emerges from it. Belatio7is. By its anterior surface, with the Sterno-mastoid ; it is crossed by the clavicle, the Omo-hyoid muscle, and subclavian artery. To its outer side is the Levator anguli scapulae, and the Scalenus posticus muscle. The Scalenus Posticus, the smallest of the three Scaleni, arises by a thin tendon from the outer surface of the second lib, behind the attachment of the Serratus magnus, and, enlarging as it ascends, is inserted by two or three separate tendons, into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the lower two or three cervical vertebra, This is the most deeply placed of the three Scaleni, and is occasionally blended with the Scalenus medius. Nerves. The Rectus capitis anticus major and minor and the Rectus lateralis are supplied by the suboccipital and deep branches of the cervical plexus; the Longus colli and Scaleni, by branches from the lower cervical nerves. Actions. The Rectus anticus major and minor are the direct antagonists of the muscles at the back of the neck, serving to restore the head to its natural position after it has been drawn backwards. These muscles also serve to flex the head, and, from their obliquity, rotate it, so as to turn the face to one or the other side. The Longus colli will flex and slightly rotate the cervical portion of the spine. The Scaleni muscles, taking their fixed point from below, bend the spinal column to one or the other side. If the muscles of both sides act, lateral movement is prevented, but the spine is slightly flexed. When they take their fixed point from above, they elevate the first and second ribs, and are, therefore, inspiratory muscles. MUSCLES AND FASCI/E OF THE TRUNK. The muscles of the Trunk may be arranged in four groups : the muscles of the Back, of the Abdomen, of the Thorax, and of the Perinasum. Muscles of the Back. The muscles of the Back are very numerous, and may be subdivided into five layers:â€”- First Layer. Third Layer. Trapezius. Serratus posticus superior. Latissimus dorsi. - Serratus posticus inferior. Splenitis capitis. Second Layer. Splenitis colli. Fourth Layer. Levator anguli scapulae. Rhomboideus minor. Sacral and Lumbar Regions. RKoniboideus major. Erector spinse.

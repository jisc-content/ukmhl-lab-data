ARTEKIES. 37° The student should attentively consider the relation of the vessels and nerves in the several parts of the axilla ; for it not unfrequently happens that the surgeon is called upon to extirpate diseased glands, or to remove a tumour from this situation. In performing such an operation, it will be necessary to proceed with much caution in the direction of the outer wall and apex of the space, as here the axillary vessels will be in danger of being wounded. Towards the posterior wall, it will be necessary to avoid the subscapular, dorsalis scapulae, and posterior 221.—The Axillary Artery, and its Branches circumflex vessels, and, along the anterior wall, the thoracic branches. It is only along the inner or thoracic wall, and in the centre of the axillary cavity, that there are no vessels of any importance; a fortunate circumstance, for it is in this situation more especially that tumours requiring removal are usually situated. The Axillary Artery. The axillary artery, the continuation of the subclavian, commences at the lower border of the first rib, and terminates at the lower border of the tendons of the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major muscles, where it takes the name of brachial. Its direction varies with the position of the limb : when the arm lies by the side of the chest, the vessel forms a gentle curve, the convexity being upwards and outwards; when it is directed at right angles with the trunk, the vessel i3 nearly straight; and when it is elevated still higher, the artery describes a curve, the concavity of which is directed upwards. At its commencement the artery is very deeply situated, but near its termination is superficial, being covered only by the skin and fascia. The description of the relations of this vessel is facilitated by

The allantois is formed by a projection of the internal germinal layer (hypoblast), taking with it the splanchnopleural layer of the mesoblast, in which latter the vessels are formed which constitute its most important part. It is at first a mere hollow projection out of the common intestinal cavity (fig. LXXVIII. c), but it soon extends into and through the pleuro-peritoneal Fig. LXXXI.—Magnified view of the human embryo of four weeks with the membranes opened (from Leishman after Coste). y The umbilical vesicle with the omphalomesenteric vessels, v, and its long tubular attachment to the intestine, c.

The epithelial or internal portion of the allantois, formed by the hypoblast, is hollow, and is usually styled the allantoic 'vesicle. The part of the allantoic vesicle outside the embryo soon withers and disappears in the human foetus, while the vascular part grows and develops into the umbilical cord. The part of the allantois internal to the embryo forms, or contributes to form, the bladder below, while its upper portion becomes impervious, and is called the urachus.

SACRAL PLEXUS. 56i transverse process of the first piece of the coccyx, and curves forwards, through the notch between the first and second pieces on the lateral border of the bone. It pierces the sacro-sciatic ligament and Coccygeus muscle, is joined by a branch from the fifth anterior sacral, and becomes lost in the integument at the back part and side of the coccyx. Sacral Plexus. v The sacral plexus is formed by the lumbo-sacral cord, the anterior divisions of the three upper sacral nerves, and part of that of the fourth. These nerves proceed in different directions ; the upper ones obliquely downwards and outwards, the lower one nearly horizontally, and they all unite into a single, broad, flat cord. The sacral plexus is triangular in form, its base corresponding with the exit of the nerves from the sacrum, its apex with the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen. It 306.—Side View of Pelvis, showing Sacral Plexus. rests upon the anterior surface of the Pyriformis, and is covered in front by the pelvic fascia, which separates it from the sciatic and pudic branches of the internal iliac artery, and from the viscera of the pelvis. The branches of the sacral plexus are :— Muscular. Pudic. Superior gluteal. Small sciatic. Great sciatic. The muscular branches supply the Pyriformis, Obturator internus, the two Gemelli, and the Quadratus femoris. The branch to the Pyriformis arises either from the plexus, or from the upper sacral nerves : the branch to the Obturator in- ternus arises at the junction of the lumbo-sacral and first sacral nerves; it passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, crosses behind the spine of the ischium, and enters the pelvis again through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen to the 0 O

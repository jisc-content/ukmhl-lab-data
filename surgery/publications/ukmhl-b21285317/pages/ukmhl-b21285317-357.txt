HIP-JOINT. 189 The Capsular Ligament is a strong, dense, ligamentous capsule, embracing the margin of the acetabulum above, and surrounding the neck of the femur below. Its upper circumference is attached to the acetabulum two or three lines external to the cotyloid ligament; but opposite the notch where the margin of this cavity is deficient, it is connected with the transverse ligament, and by a few fibres to the edge of the obturator foramen. Its lower circumference surrounds the neck of the femur, being attached, in front, to the spira.1 or anterior intertrochanteric line; above, to the base of the neck; behind, to the middle of the neck of the bone, about half an inch above the posterior intertrochanteric line. It is much thicker at the upper and fore part of the joint where the greatest amount of resistance is required, than below, where it is thin, loose, and longer than in any other part. Its external surface (fig. 127, p. 166) is rough, covered by numerous muscles, and separated in front from the Psoas and Iliacus by a synovial bursa, which not un- frequently communicates by a circular aperture with the cavity of the joint. It 139.—The Hip-Joint laid open from the Pelvis, to show the Ligamentum Teres put on the stretch by rotation of the Femur outwards. differs from the capsular ligament of the shoulder, in being much less loose and lax, and in not being pjrforated for the passage of a tendon. The Iliofemoral Ligament (fig. 127) is an accessory band of fibres, extending 140.—The same view of the Hip as in the former figure, to show the Ligamentum Teres put on the stretch by adduction in the flexed position. obliquely across the front of the joint; it is intimately connected with the capsular ligament, and serves to strengthen it in this situation. It is attached, above, to the anterior inferior spine of the ilium ; below, to the anterior intertrochanteric line.

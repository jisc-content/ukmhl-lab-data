493 LATERAL VENTRICLES. grey matter which forms the greater part of its substance. The intraventricular portion (nucleus caudatus) is a large pear-shaped mass, of a grey colour externally; its broad extremity is directed forwards, into the fore part of the body, and anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle : its narrow end is directed outwards and backwards, being separated from its fellow by the optic thalami : it is covered by the serous lining of the cavity, and crossed by some veins of considerable size. The extra- ventricular portion (nucleus lenticularis) is imbedded in the white substance of the hemisphere. The tmnia semicircular is is a narrow, whitish, semi-transparent, band of medullary substance, situated in the depression between the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus. Anteriorly, it descends in connection with the anterior pillar of the fornix; 274.â€”The Lateral Ventricles of the Brain. behind, it is continued into the descending horn of the ventricle, where it becomes lost, Its surface, especially at its fore part, is transparent, and dense in structure, and this was called by Tarinus the horny band. It consists of longitudinal white fibres, the deepest of which run between the corpus striatum and optic thalamus. Beneath it is a large vein (vena corporis striati), which receives numerous small veins from the surface of the corpus striatum and optic thalamus, and joins the venae Galeni. The choroid plexus is a highly vascidar, fringe-like membrane, occupying the margin of the fold of pia mater (velum interpositum), in the interior of the brain. It extends, in a curved direction, across the floor of the lateral ventricle. In front, where it is small and tapering, it communicates with the choroid plexus of the opposite side, through a large oval aperture, the foramen of Monro. Posteriorly, it

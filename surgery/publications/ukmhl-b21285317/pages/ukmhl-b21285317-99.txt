THE NERVES. xci tion he is able to follow the nerve-fibrils much beyond the point at which that author describes them as terminating. The appearance of their pene- trating the sarcolemma he regards as an optical illusion, and the nuclei shown in the above figures are, according to him, situated outside of the muscular fibres on the point of junction of the fibrils which form the intricate and extensive plexus in which the nerves terminate, so that the Fig. LIV.â€”Terminations of motor nerves, according to Beale. i. Nerve-tuft on the sarcolemma of a muscular fibre ; chameleon. Nerve-fibres are seen passing out of us well as into the tuft. 2. Nerve-fibres distributed to elementary muscular fibres ; chameleoD, x 3000, and reduced half. This is a very simple form of 'nerve-tuft' clearly external to the sarcolemma. 3. The intimate structure of a very simple ' nerve-tuft' on a muscular fibre of the chameleon. It will be observed that the nerve-fibres are continuous throughout, and that the whole is on the surface of the sarcolemma, x 3000. This ' nerve-tuft' is, as it were, but a compound network. nerves nowhere terminate in free ends, nor at any definite part of the fibre ; but, on the contrary, surround every point of the latter with a very close interlacement. By the kindness of Dr. Beale we are enabled to reproduce some of the figures representing preparations which he exhibited to the British Medical Association at Oxford in 1868, in illustration of this view.

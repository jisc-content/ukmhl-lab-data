THE DEC1DUA. CXXVll encircle the ovum. Thus two portions of the uterine mucous membrane (decidua) are formed—viz. that which coats the muscular wall of the uterus, decidua vera, and that which is in contact with the ovum, decidua reflexa. The decidua does not extend into the neck of the uterus, which after conception is closed by a plug of mucus. The decidua vera is per- forated by the openings formed by the enlarged uterine glands, which become much hypertrophied and developed into tortuous tubes. It con- tains at a later period numerous arteries and venous channels, continuous with the uterine sinuses, and it is from it that the uterine part of the Fig. LXXXII.—Sectional plan of the gravid uterus, from Wagner, in the third and fourth month.

The portion of the decidua vera which takes part in the formation of the placenta is called the decidua serotina. The decidua reflexa is shaggy on its outer aspect, but smooth within. The vessels, which it contains at first, disappear after about tbe third month; about the fifth or sixth month the space between the two layers of the decidua disappears, and towards the end of pregnancy the decidua is transformed into a thin yellowish membrane, which constitutes the external envelope of the ovum. Much additional interest has been given to the physiology of the

Behind, it rests upon the bronchi, the oesophagus, and the descending aorta. Laterally, it is covered by the pleura; the phrenic nerve, with its accompanying vessels, descending between the two membranes on either side. The pericardium is a fibro-serous membrane, and consists, therefore, of two layers, an external fibrous and an internal serous. The fibrous layer is a strong, dense membrane. Above, it surrounds the great 389.â€”Front View of the Thorax. The "Ribs and Sternum are represented in Relation to the Lungs, Heart, and other Internal Organs. M. Mitral valve. T. Tricuspid valve.

The pericardium may be traced, over these vessels, to become continuous with the deep layer of the cervical fascia. Below, it is attached to the central tendon of the Diaphragm ; and, on the left side, to its muscular fibres. The vessels receiving fibrous prolongations from this membrane are the aorta, the superior vena cava, the right and left pulmonary arteries, and the four pulmonary veins. As the inferior vena cava enters the pericardium through the central tendon of the Diaphragm, it receives no covering from the fibrous layer. The serous layer invests the heart, and is then reflected on the inner sui'face of

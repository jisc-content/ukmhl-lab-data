THE KIDNEYS. 727 change, becoming very angular, and presenting thick bright rods or markings, which render the striation much more distinct than in any other section of the urinary tubules (fig. 415, h). In the distal convoluted tubule the epithelium appears to be identical with that which has been described as existing in the proximal convoluted tubule (fig. 415, b). In the curved tubule, just before its entrance into the straight collecting tube, the epithelium varies greatly as regards the shape of the cells, some being angular with short processes, others spindle-shaped, others polyhedral (fig. 415.E)- 417.—Transverse Section of Pyramidal Substance of Kidney of Pig, the Blood- vessels of which are injected.

In the straight tubes the epithelium is morn or less columnar ; in its papillary portion the cells are distinctly columnar and transparent, but as the tube approaches the cortex the cells are less uniform in shape; some are polyhedral, and others angular with short processes (fig. 415, F and g). The Renal Blood-vessels : their Origin, Course, and Distribution.—The kidney is plentifully supplied with blood by the renal artery, a large offset of the abdominal aorta, which enters the sinus through the hilum, dividing in its passage through the hitter into four or five branches. These, whilst in the sinus, give off a few * From the ' Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory.'

ARCH OF AORTA. 329 Ascending Part of the Arch. The ascending portion of the arch of the aorta is abont two inches in length. It commences at the upper part of the left ventricle, in front of the left auriculo- ventricular orifice, and on a level with the lower border of the third costal cartilage of the left side close to the sternum; it passes obliquely upwards in the direction of the heart's axis, to the right side, as high as the upper border of the second costal cartilage, describing a slight curve in its course, and being situated, when distended, about a quarter of an inch behind the posterior surface of the sternum. 209.â€”The Arch of the Aorta and its Branches. A little above its commencement, it is somewhat enlarged, and presents three small dilatations, called the sinuses of the aorta (sinuses of Valsalva), opposite to which are attached the three semilunar valves, which serve the purpose of preventing any regurgitation of blood into the cavity of the ventricle. A section of the aorta opposite this part has a somewhat triangular figure ; but below the attachment of the valves it is circular. This portion of the heart is contained in the cavity of the pericardium, and, together with the pulmonary artery, is invested in a tube of serous membrane, continued on to them from the surface of the heart.

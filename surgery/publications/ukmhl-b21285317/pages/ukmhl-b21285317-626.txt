LYMPHATICS 458 vessels, being joined by the lymphatics from the pharynx, oesophagus, larynx, trachea, and thyroid gland. A_t the lower part of the neck, after receiving some lymphatics from the thorax, they unite into a single trunk, which terminates on the left side, in the thoracic duct • on the right side, in the right lymphatic duct. Lymphatics of the Upper Extremity. The Lymphatic Glands of the upper extremity (fig. 256) may be subdivided into two sets, superficial and deep. 256.—The Superficial Lymphatics and Glands of the Upper Extremity. The superficial lymphatic glands are few and of small size. There are occasion- ally two or three in front of the elbow, and one or two above the internal condyle of the humerus, near the basilic vein. The deep lymphatic glands are also few in number. In the fore-arm a few small ones are occasionally found in the course of the radial and ulnar vessels; and in the arm, there is a chain of small glands along the inner side of the brachial artery.

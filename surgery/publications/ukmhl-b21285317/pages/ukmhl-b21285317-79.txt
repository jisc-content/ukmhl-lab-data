Ixxi NERVOUS TISSUE. there is found a third structure—chiefly in the sympathetic system—called the gelatinous nerve-tissue. The nervous substance is again divided into two different systems. The first is connected directly with the great central mass enclosed in the skull and spine. This is called the cerebrospinal system, and is divided into the brain (including the medulla oblongata), the spinal cord, the cranial nerves, the spinal nerves, and the ganglia connected with both those classes of nerves. The second, called the sympathetic system, is not directly connected with the brain or spinal cord, though it is so indirectly by means of its numerous communications with the cranial and spinal nerves. It consists of a double chain of ganglia, with the branches which go to and come from them. A third method of division of the nervous system is based upon the functions which it performs. On this principle it is divided into the Fig. XXXVII.—Nerve-vesicles from the inner part of the grey matter of the convolutions of Fig. XXXVI.—Nerve-vesicles from the the human Drain.

It is clear that the former cpialities reside mainly in the cerebro-spinal system, while the intimate connection between the sympathetic nerve and the great viscera renders it highly probable that the sympathetic system has mainly to do with the organic functions. Consequently, the cerebro-spinal system was designated the system of animal life, and the sympathetic the system of organic life. But the distinction, though true to a certain extent, is by no means com- plete, as the student may easily see by consulting the works of modern physiologists. The grey or vesicular nervous substance is distinguished by its dark reddish-grey colour and soft consistence. It is found in the brain, spinal cord, and various ganglia, intermingled with the fibrous nervous substance,

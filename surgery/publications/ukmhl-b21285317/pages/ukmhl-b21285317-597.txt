429 OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Masseter, crosses over the body of the lower jaw, with the facial artery, and, passing obliquely outwards and backwards, beneath the Platysma and cervical fascia, unites with a branch of communication from the temporo-maxillary vein, to form a trunk of large size which enters the internal jugular. Branches. The facial vein receives, near the angle of the mouth, communi- cating branches from the pterygoid plexus. It is also joined by the inferior palpebral, the superior and inferior labial veins, the buccal veins from the cheek, 240.â€”Veins of the Head and Neck. and the masseteric veins. Below the jaw it receives the submental, the inferior palatine, which returns the blood from the plexus around the tonsil and soft palate ; the submaxillary vein, which commences in the submaxillary gland; and, generally, the ranine vein. The Temporal Vein commences by a minute plexus on the side and vertex of the skull, which communicates with the frontal vein in front, the corresponding vein of the opposite side, and the posterior auricular and occipital veins behind. From this network, anterior and posterior branches are formed which unite above the zygoma, forming the trunk of the vein. This trunk is joined in this situation by a

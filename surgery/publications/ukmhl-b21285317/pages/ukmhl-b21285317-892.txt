It is pierced at a point usually opposite the centre of the tubule, with which it is continuous, by the afferent and efferent renals, and is lined upon its inner surface by a delicate layer of flattened epithelial cells; but as regards this layer, whether it is prolonged over the tuft either in whole or in part, there is a diversity of opinion among many of the 413.—Diagrammatic Representation of the Blood- vessels in the Substance of the Cortex of the Kidney. 412.—Minute Structure of f fctricker's ' Handbook.') most eminent observers. According to Henle, Ecker, and Bowman, it is not reflected U[)on the tuft at all, so that the latter hangs free and uncovered in the interior of the capsule (fig. 414, a) ; on the other hand, Gerlach, Isaachs, Moleschott, and Chrzonszczewsky assert that it can be traced upon the whole of the tuft, and that the cells are even larger and better marked than those upon the internal surface of the capsule (fig. 414, n); whilst yet a third arrangement has been described by Kolliker, 414. who says that the tuft has no epithelial lining on the greater part of its extent, but upon that portion which looks towards the commencing tubule a special layer of cubical cells can always be seen (fig. 414, c).* In the frog, the cells lining the interior of the capsule, near its junction with the tube, are provided with cilia; but in the human subject their presence has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. * It is now very generally admitted that the glomerulus is covered with a layer of epi- thelial cells, because 111 the development of the Malpighian bodies, the extremity of the urinary tube becomes invaginated by the growth of the glomerulus. Hence in the foetus the epithe- lium covering the vessels is especially distinct, and is made up of polyhedral cells.

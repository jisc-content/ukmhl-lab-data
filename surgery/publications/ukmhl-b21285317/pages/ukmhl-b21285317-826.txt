ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 658 length from half an inch to four inches. They are largest and most numerous in the ileum. In the lower part of the jejunum they are small, of a circular form, and few in number. They are occasionally seen in the duodenum. They are placed lengthwise in the intestine, covering the portion of the tube most distant from the attachment of the mesentery. Each patch is formed of a group of the above- described lymphoid follicles covered with mucous membrane. Each is surrounded 369.—Patch of Peyer's Glands. 370.—A portion of the above magnified. From the lower part' of the Ileum. 371.—Vertical Section of one of Peyer's Patches from Man, injected through its lymphatic canals. a. Villi with their chyle-passages, b. Follicles of LieVrkiihn. c. Muscularis mucosas, d. Cupola or apex of solitary glands, e. Mesial zone of glands. /. Base of glands. g. Points of exit of the chyle-passages from the villi, ami entrance into the true mucous membrane, h. Retiform arrangement of the lymphatics in the mesial zone, t". Course of the latter at the base of the glands, k. Confluence of the lymphatics opening into the vessels of the submucous tissue. I. Follicular tissue of the latter. by a zone, or wreath of simple follicles, and the interspaces between them are covered with villi, while the surface of the gland is destitute of these structures. The mucous and submucous coats of the intestine are intimately adherent, and highly vas- cular, opposite the Peyerian glands. They are largest and most developed during the digestive process.

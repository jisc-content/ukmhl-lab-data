The sulci are generally an inch in depth ; they also vary in different braina, and in different parts of the same brain; they are usually deepest on the outer convex surface of the hemispheres ; the deepest is situated on the inner surface of the henii- sphere, on a level with the corpus callosum, and corresponds to the projection in the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, the hippocampus minor. The number and extent of the convolutions, as well as their depth, appear to bear a close relation to the intellectual power of the individual, as is shown in their increasing complexity of arrangement as we ascend from the lowest mammalia 268.â€”Upper Surface of the Brain, the Arachnoid having been removed.

In man they present the most complex arrangement. Again, in the child at birth before the intellectual faculties are exercised, the convolutions have a very simple arrangement, presenting few undulations; and the sulci between them are less deep than in the adult. Tn old age, when the mental faculties have diminished in activity, the convolutions become much less prominently marked. * In the specimen from which this figure was drawn, the parieto-occipital fissure has been bridged over, or obliterated, by one of the annectant convolutions of the occipital lobe, but its continuation can be traced on the internal aspect of the hemisphere.. See fig. 278, 3.

THE NOSE. 583 The upper lateral cartilages are situated below the free margin of the nasal bones; each cartilage is flattened, and triangular in shape. Its anterior margin is thicker than the posterior, and connected with the fibre-cartilage of the septum. 315. 316.—Cartilages of the Nose. Seen from below atwal C. Its posterior margin is attached to the nasal process of the superior maxillary and nasal bones. Its inferior margin is connected by fibrous tissue with the lower lateral cartilage : one surface is turned outwards, the other inwards towards the nasal cavity. The lower lateral cartilages are two thin, flexible plates, situated immediately below the preceding, and curved 317 .—Bones and Cartilages of Septum of Nose. Right Side. in such a manner as to form the inner and outer walls of each orifice of the nostril. The por- tion which forms the inner wall, thicker than the rest, is loosely connected with the same part of the opposite cartilage, and forms a small part of the columna. Its outer extremity, free, rounded, and projecting, forms, with the thickened iniegument and sub- jacent tissue, the lobe of the nose. The part which forms the outer wall is curved to correspond with the ala of the nose : it is oval and flattened, narrow behind, where it is connected with the nasal process of the superior maxilla by a tough fibrous mem- brane, in which are found three or four small cartilaginous plates (sesamoid cartilages), cartilagines minores. Above, it is connected to the upper lateral cartilage and front part of the cartilage of the septum; below, it is separated from the margin of the nostril by dense cellular tissue ; and in front, it forms, with its fellow, the prominence of the tip of the nose. The cartilage of the septum is somewhat triangular in form, thicker at its margins than at its centre, and completes the separation between the nasal fossae in front.

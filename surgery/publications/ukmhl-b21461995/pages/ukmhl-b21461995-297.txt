In another case, in a woman, she lived but a short time; but in the third, though the patient recovered from the accidGut for awhile, the haemorrhage being with difficulty stopped, yet the excessive loss of blood produced a dropsy. I do not myself see the necessity, in any operation for her- nia, to run such a risk by cutting inwards, even if the artery ran on the other side. Having divided the stricture, if there is still an incapability of returning the intestine, the operator must look for a mem- branous band, which is easily seen by pulling down the gut, and carefully dividing it. The state of the prolapsed parts are to be then examined, and prior to dividing the stricture, I should not conceive it proper to do so, as no correct judgment can be formed while there is an obstacle to the free return of blood. If the intestine is mortified, it will have several purple spots on its surface, which assume a chocolate colour previous to the removal of the stricture : on putting the finger on the mortified part, some- times only coagulable lymph will be found; but in case you cannot peel this off, do not return it, but adopt the following treatment: if a small portion of the cylinder is diseased, a ligature is to be passed through the attached mesentery, at right angles with the intestine, and then through the hernial sac; by which means the intestine becomes confined to the aperture, adhesions form, and an artificial anus is produced; the opening has closed in some few instances after a time, and the faeces have resumed their natural course: but when the whole C2/linder is mortified, the diseased part should be cut away, the divided ends brought together and united by four ligatures inserted at proper or equal distances around the in- testine, cutting the ends of the ligatures close off. But it would appear from the experience of others, that the practice they adopt, is thisâ€”first divide the stricture so as entirely to re- move the cause of strangulation ; and secondly, make an opening into the intestine, so as to communicate with the abdomen : if the stricture only is divided, the constipation, hiccup, and vo- mitting continue; but if the intestine is opened, these symptoms,

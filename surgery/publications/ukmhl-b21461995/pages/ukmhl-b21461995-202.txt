One ligature, properly applied, appears to be sufficient, and there will be no necessity to divide the vessel. To secure the axillary artery below the claville, the following operation is necessary, which has been performed successfully by Mr. Keate. The tumour had burst, and the artery was compressed against the first rib—an incision was made ob- liquely downwards, below the clavicle, the fibres of the pec- toral muscle were divided, and when he came to the artery he passed a curved blunt pointed silver needle, doubly armed, as he thought under the artery, and tied two of the ends; as the artery still pulsated below the ligature, another was passed more deeply, higher up, nearer to the clavicle, and tied. Mr. Charles Bell, in his System of Operative Surgery, details a more easy method, but very similar: the incision is to com- mence about an inch from the sternal end of the clavicle, in .a direction towards the acromion, the direction to be a little downwards, from a line parallel to the clavicle—here the fibrea of the pectoral muscle are exposed, which are to be divided: underneath is some cellular substance, which is to be carefully elevated with a pair of forceps and cut; this will bring into view the subclavian vein, and cephalic vein uniting with it; under the subclavian vein, and a little backwards, more under the clavicle, the artery may be felt and tied. Another method is this : an incision, to the extent of three inches, is to be made below the clavicle, over the space between the deltoid and pectoral muscles, which will expose the axillary vein, situated anterior to the artery, and which latter vessel is lying among the cervical nerves: great care must be taken not to wound the vein, or include a nerve in the ligature; having passed a liga- ture under the artery, detach it completely from the nerves- one ligature will be here only necessary, and no division re- quired.

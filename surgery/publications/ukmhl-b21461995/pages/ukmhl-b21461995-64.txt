Pure pus has not the power of irritating the surfaces in con- tact, being quite a bland fluid : but this is only so when it is iri an healthy state, and unchanged ; for as soon as any irritating cause has acted on it, or the vessels rather that secrete it, so as to excite a total change in regard to its texture, then the surfaces no longer secrete a mild bland fluid, but what is already effused becomes ichorous, exciting irritation in the ad- jacent parts; such is the case in bones when exposed, where true pus is seldom or ever formed, of which doctrine we have a simple, but sufficiently illustrative example, in the instance of a nail growing into the skin, the parts become irritated, and instead of secreting pus, are ,discharging an ichorous matter; as soon as true pus is formed on any sore, inflammation imme- diately ceases ; this latter process is absolutely required for the production of the former, but of no longer utility when formed: for if contrary to what happens commonly, inflammation con- tinues, or is resumed afterwards, it prevents any further secretion. On a part being irritated by any poisonous matter, that part directly becomes inflamed, and produces in it a poison similar to that which was applied, and if this morbid matter be introduced into the system by absorption, so as to affect the constitution generally, it then brings on fever by its irritation, and generates similar poison throughout the system at large. We have examples of this in syphilis, small-pox, &c. &c. in these cases the constitution takes on a particular action, which is continued as long as the cause is applied. The uses of suppuration are twofold, and those are un- portant; 1st. by its covering granulations, and keeping them in a moist state, otherwise no sore could be possibly healed; for if a sore be exposed to the action of the atmosphere, it soon becomes encrusted, and under which matter is confined, which keep the granulations perfectly moist, so that Nature here per- forms her part without the aid of surgery; the 2d use it has, is by its pressure on parts so as to cause them to be absorbed, and by that means rid the body of extraneous substances; m this, it acts similar to ulcerated parts.

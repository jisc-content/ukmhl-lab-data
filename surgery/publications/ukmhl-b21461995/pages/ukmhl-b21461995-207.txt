Operation for the Cataract.—The operation is commonly divided into two kinds, but properly speaking, there are three. The Jirst is by extraction, or removal of the cry- stalline lens, by a semicircular incision being made through the transparent cornea : the second is that of couching or depression of the lens into the vitreous humour: the third is by punctur- ing the capsule of the crystalline humour, so as to allow of the discharge of the lens into the anterior chamber of the eye. MoBE BY Extraction.'—It is necessary to keep in mind, that there is a good deal of danger to be apprehended from the ensuing inflammation, and therefore the patient must be prepared, in some degree, by purgative medicines, and even by bleeding, if the patient is of a robust anfi plethoric habit. But the best method that I am acquainted with, and that adopted by the most celebrated oculists, for preparing the patient for the operation, and from which he will derive con- siderable benefit, is this; to draw a probe, a few days previous to the operation, across the eye, over the cornea, and to repeat this plan twice, daily; this will, at first, from its irritation, excite, as might naturally be expected, considerable pain, which will gradually diminish after a few days use: it will have this effect—the patient will be less liable, after the operation, to excessive constitutional irritation, from his having been thus habituated gradually to an irritant. The light for operating must not be too strong, and it should fall obliquely on the eye, not direct. In fixing the patient, care must be taken that the light does not fall on that part of the eye where the knife is to be directed, and let the chair, which should be a low one, be placed with a degree of obliquity towards the window. The oculist is to be seated on a high chair, rather on one side of the patient, so as to rest his foot upon the side of the patient's chair, with his arm resting upon his knee, and his hand on the P 2

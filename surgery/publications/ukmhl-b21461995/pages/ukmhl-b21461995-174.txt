The parts that should be avoided, if possible, in the operation, and which ought to be well known, are these: aline drawn from the nose to the ridge of the os occipitis, on account of the fron- tal and longitudinal sinusses, and the falsiform process of the dura mater. Avoid the lower edges of the parietal bones, which are anterior to the ear, and nearly at its superior part, as at the anterior and inferior angle the foramen for the dura matral ar- tery lies; not but the hemorrhage might be stopped, and conse- quently if an operation is required on that part it certainly may be done, but if it can be avoided so much the better. When called to a fracture with depression (supposing the symptoms warrant an operation), the first thing to be done is, to make a longitudinal incision, which should be about two inches in length, so as effectually to expose the whole extent of the fracture; but the length of the incision must depend, in a great measure, upon circumstances; then raising the pericra- nium in the same direction, apply the trephine in the manner I shall hereafter describe. It will be better practice ta make a crucial incision, and remember to make it chiefly on the sound portion of the bone, I mean that which is near the fracture, but remaining in its situation; or about two-thirds on the sound bone, and one-third on the depressed portion : having made the crucial incision, and having raised the pericranium in the same direction, taking care not to raise more of the latter than is absolutely necessary, as exfoliation will be more likely to take place, the trephine is to be applied, pushing down the pm m it, â– which then becomes a perforator, and work on till a complete circle is made, and the saw remains in its place, without the aid of the pin, which is then to be withdrawn. It has been re- marked by some authors, that the operation ought to be pro- ceeded in till a bloody discharge from the diplo6; but if this was to be attended to indiscriminately, it would lead us often into great and fatal errors ; for instance, in old and very young subjects there is no diploe: the pressure of the saw must be made very even, and if the bone has yielded in one part before another, the saw must be worked on that part which has not <riven way. As soon as it is found, 6y sounding with a probe (which should be done frequentlj/), that the bone is loose at

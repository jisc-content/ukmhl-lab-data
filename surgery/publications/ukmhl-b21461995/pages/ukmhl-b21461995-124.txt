LECTURE iLi 114 fell from a tree upon a stake, though the wound thus produced was a ragged one, yet it united by adhesion. It is very requi- site to apply sutures, on account of the variation in the size of the chest, resulting from respiration. When wounds of the chest are accompanied by injury done to the contained parts, the most decided treatment is necessary; if the lungs are wounded, the circumstance is known by the patient's coughing up frothy blood, at the same time there is considerable haemorrage from the external wound, and if the wound is made with a sharp instrument this is often in great quantities; the patient has extreme difficulty in breathing, and more especially if the external wound is small: emphysema is also produced by the escape of air from the bronchial cells into the cellular membrane covering the chest. The treatment required must be guided by the space of time that has elapsed since the accident was received, for these wounds are attended with danger of three kinds after the accident; first, from the quantity of blood lost; secondly, from inflammation of the lung on that side of the chest; and, thirdly, from suppuration, or hydro-thorax; as matter is sometimes forming at a distant period after the accident, as well as an efi'usion of water. With respect to the first, it is necessary to stop this, by taking away a large quantity of blood from the arm suddenly, as this bleeding must be carried so far as to produce syncope, when the hzemorrhage from the wound will cease, and then the edges of the wound may be brought into contact by sutures and ad- hesive plasters, previously cleaning away any coagula which may have been formed between the edges of the wound. Secondly. If inflammation arises, and the patient is suff'ering considerable pain between the scapulae, as well as in the head, it is right to repeat the bleeding, and this must be done very freely : those are most likely to recover who have been depleted copiously, and many have been seen to die for want of this boldness of practice: the most perfect rest must be observed, and the antiphlogistic regimen strictly enjoined ; every thing given should be cool. The bleedings have been carried by some able practitioners to a great "extent in these woundsâ€”it is what is principally to be relied on for the recovery of the

LECTURE XIX. 24f tained by introducing a catheter, which would naturally be re- sorted to in the first instance, for the purpose of relieving the patient of a retention of urine : if a stone is discovered in the uretiira, be careful not to pass the catheter any further, for fear of pushing it back into the bladder: the best plan will be to pass the largest sized bougie as far as the stone, suffering it to remain there until such time as the patient becomes dis- tressed on account of the bladder being greatly distended with urine, and is under the necessity of trying to void it, to relieve himself: at this time withdraw the bougie, and direct the pa- tient to pass his urine immediately, and the chances are that the stone is discharged at the same time ; but if it is too large to allow of this being accomplished, the operation must then be directly resorted to, which is similar at first to that already described for lithotomy, with this precaution, that the finger must be introduced, at the time of operating, up the rectum, otherwise the- stone will certainly be forced into the bladder, and thus render the operation an extremely difficult one. When a calculus is situated opposite the scrotum, and an operation is thought advisable, it would be improper to make an incision into the scrotum for the purpose, as those parts are so liable to subsequent inflammation and sloughing. The manner then in which the extraction is to be accomplished, is by first pushing the stone a little behind the scrotum, and then making the incision upon it into the urethra, taking care that the external opening is sufficiently large, as a great deal of trouble will otherwise be occasioned afterwards ; and not only here, but in the first instance, there will be a great impedi- ment, if not altogether frustrate the perforznance of the operation satisfactorily. There is a further objection against opening through the scrotum, which is, that after this is done, there is an almost impossibility of withdrawing the stone; but by the other mode it will be very easily accomplished, if the external opening is made to a proper extent, taking care that the incision is continued quite dT5wn to the stone, which may be extracted by laying open the corpus spongiosum.

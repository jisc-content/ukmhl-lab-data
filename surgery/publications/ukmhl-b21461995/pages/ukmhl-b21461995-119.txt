The lameness gradually lessened, and he found much benefit from putting his leg under a water spout every morning, which seemed to strengthen it very much. Whether partially or completely divided, the same intentions are to be kept in view, WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. These* may be divided into two kinds, namely, those which penetrate the parletes of the abdomen, without injuring any viscus ; and those which enter the cavity, and wound some one or more of the contained viscera. It is singular that very large wounds have been made into this cavity, without wounding any of theSe parts : this is arising from their eluding the blows, in consequence of their great mobility and lubricity. A curi- ous case, illustrative of this fact, was seen in a lady who divided the abdominal muscles and peritoneum from the ensi- form cartilage to the symphysis pubis, with a razor, without injuring in the least degree the intestines. In these cases, where none of the viscera are wounded, which may be known almost always by the attendant symptoms, the gastroraphe must be adopted as soon as possible, which means the sewing up of the wound, in order to shut up the cavity; then apply adhesive plaster, and a proper bandage to support the parts in contact: in some cases the common interrupted suture will be best, if the wound is not very extensive.

342 LECTURE XXX. LECTURE XXX. THE EFFECTS OF GONORRHCEA ON THE BLADDER. The bladder is occasionally getting into an irritable stale, which mostly proceeds from the use of very powerful injections during the inflammatory stage of gonorrhoea. It sometimes denotes the existence of stricture in the canal. Now and then it is attended with the symptoms of stone in the bladder, and these are so similarly marked, that it is difficult to discriminate one from the other. The s?/mptoms of an irritable bladder are, a frequent incli- nation to void urine in the day time, probably every three or four minutes, and six or seven times in the course of the night. As soon as the bladder is a little distended with urine, there will be a strong propensity to discharge it, and any attempts made to retain and overcome this troublesome desire is attend- ed with an excruciating pain in the regio pubis. There is also a considerable quantity of mucus discharged along with the urine, which is often tinged with blood. The bladder occasionally becomes inflamed, and contracts adhesions to the abdominal muscles, and if the patient is of a delicate habit of body he is very much curved forward. The passing of any instrument into the bladder occasions symptoms the most distressing, nor do the sufferings in this case abate for a considerable time. It had the eff"ect of exaggerating the distress so much in a case of this kind in a young gentleman, that mo^t of the subsequerif danger was attributed entirely to this cause. The disease, in the first instance, arose in consequence of his retaining his urine too long, through motives of delicacy.

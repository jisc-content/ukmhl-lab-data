214 LECTURE XVII. may live to a good old age; but the contrary is perceived to take place in ascites. Dropsy of the ovary is of two kinds; in the first, the fluctua- tion sometimes is not very distinct. Before an operation is undertaken, the fluctuation should be distinctly ascertamed, and unless complicated with ascites, the second kind, the swell- ing is either on one side the abdomen or the other ; the water is at first collected in a number of cysts or bags, which do not adhere in the first instance, although adhesions between them take place subsequently. There would be great risk m ope- rating in the early stages of this disease, and no benefit could possibly accrue, as if one of the cysts was opened, still others would remain; and the chances are, that peritoneal inflamma- tion would take place, and the operation is only warranted when the quantity of fluid is pretty large. The quantity of water in ovarial dropsy is commonly from thirty to thirty-five pints, and cases have occurred where it exceeded ninety-seven ; it varies also very much both in its consistence and colour, sometimes being yellow, at others ropy, and occasionally pu- rulent- if thick at first, tapping will make it thinner, and vice versa What is above stated is applicable to ascites or pen- toneal dropsy, the distinguishing marks of which I shall now state • a swelling in the abdominal cavity with a sense of tight- ness all over the belly, so that the patient's clothes gradually get too tight, and require enlarging; the breathmg difficult and faborious, especially when in a recumbent posture, or m bed; a fluctuation may be distinctly felt by one hand bemg placed on one side the patient's abdomen, when it is struck forcibly on the opposite side with the other; besides there are-many other concurrent symptoms, such as thirst, heat of the skin, scarcity of urine, &c.

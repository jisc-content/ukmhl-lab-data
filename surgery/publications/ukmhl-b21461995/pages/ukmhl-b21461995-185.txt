175 I^ECTURE Xir. in Guy's Hospital; about two years after, he was again ad- mitted and it was done by a dresser, and in a proper manner, as he concluded; but during the operation, the patient appeared in excruciating pain; to reheve which, the dresser removed the elastic bottle, but was much surprised not to see any fluid re- turn with it, neither was he able even by pressure to get out any of the injection, it having passed into the cellular mem- brane, owing to the canula not properli/ Jitling the trocar, and the more he pressed, the more the injection passed towards the abdomen ; the consequence was, excessive inflammation, suc- ceeded by mortification, which carried him off". If any sur- geon should be thus circumstanced, I would advise the imme- diate enlargement of the orifice, and the injection of a large quantity of water, so as to dilute the first solution used, in order to take ofi" in some measure its stimulating effect. But, in fact, this case proving fatal, was chiefly to be attributed to the dresser. There is danger ensuing from the injection when the tunica vaginalis communicates with the abdomen, and I would advise it by no means to be used where this exists, as it com- monly does in young persons, as they may be treated in a much better way, which I shall notice: but if it is done at all, which I would not think at any time prudent, pressure must be made on the mouth of the tunic with an assistant's fingers, or otherwise peritoneal inflammation would take place ; on which account, I should certainly prefer letting the disease alone, and treat the cure as hernia, that is, by putting on a truss on the mouth of the tunic, which will in the course of a few months close the communication by means of adhesion; and after the opening has been closed, the disease then becomes more simple, and may be treated by injection, if the patient is an adult, except its being also complicated with a tendency to dropsy, the symptoms of which it will be by all means de- sirable previously to remove. In young people I should not, from what I have seen, advise the injection, but merely make use of the stimulating applications already mentioned, or any others of a similar nature, and which will most commonly suc- ceed. It has been objected to the operation by injection, that the state of the testicle cannot be accurately known ; but this is

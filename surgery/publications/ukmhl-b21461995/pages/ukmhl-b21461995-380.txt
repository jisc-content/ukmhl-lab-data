570 LECTURE XXXl. I have seen several lamentable cases of this kind. It is to the interposition of the shealh surrounding the femoral vessels, that many patients owe their existence. BUBOES IN WOMEN. Two of the situations are different to those in men. When the chancre is on the labia nymphae, the venereal matter will be carried along the round ligament, and the seat of the bubo will be there, just before it enters the abdominal ring: when the chancre is more backward, then the bubo will be situated be- tween the labia and groin, or in the groin itself, similar to men. What I have remarked on this complaint in men, as to treat- ment, will be wholly applicable to the same in women. LOCALITY OF BUBOES. These affections are entirely local, liaving no more connexion with the constitution than chancres, from which they arise; some, notwithstanding, have been absurd enough to consider them in the light of a critical deposit; but why, if this was the fact, should the absorbent glands be affected ? and why should not the glands in the neck, and elsewhere, be affected as readily as those in the groin, or those nearest the source of absorption? and lastly, if critical, why should it be necessary to administer mercury. The difference in the treatment of buboes depends on this: mercury can only cure the specific disposition of the inflam- mation : sometimes there is a great deal of common phlegmo- nous inflammation ; at other times, erysipelatous, and in some the inflammation partakes of the scrophulous diathesis: the i^pecific requires mercury; the common, bleeding and purging, &c.; the erysipelatous, bark, &c.; and the last, cicuta, sea water poultices, &c.; abstaining from the use of mercury in all except the first. Emetics have been known to cure bu- boes, even where suppuration has taken place; they seem to cause a disposition for absorption. A gentleman went to sea with a suppurating bubo, sea sickness occasioned its entire.

Copper, when taken, may be detected by the beautiful blue colour produced in its solution by pure ammonia. If alarming symptoms are occasioned by eating food dressed in a copper vessel badly tinned, charcoal will be found of great service. If roerdigrise has been taken, emetics, and then alkali must be re- sorted to, and from the chemical action which saccharine mat- ter has on verdigrise, rendering it insoluble in water, sugar may be given. LECTURE XIII. ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. I SHALL commence this subject with superficial injuries. On account of the occipito-fruntalis muscle, (which has its origin from the transverse protruberating ridge of the os oc- cipitis to the basis of the mastoid process of the temporal bone) spreading into a very broad tendon, which covers the upper and lateral parts of the head, and extending to the m- teguments of the eyebrows, and even to the dorsum of the nose, and its adhering to the skin of the head, and being attached to the bone onlj/ by a loose cellular structure, forms a consider- able interstitial cavity, and owing to .this peculiar structure is seen so frequently to arise from a puncture in this part or wound, an erysipelatous inflammation; this may, perhaps, be ascribed to the injury done to the cellular membrane: the parts become red and inflamed, and if not properly treated in the first in- stance, suppuration commences, and numerous abscesses form under the tendon, and sloughing will ensue from portions of the tendon becoming dead: the reason appears to be, that a

If the artery is seated near a bone, it would appear that the whole circumference of the tube is not equally absorbed, and the expansion of the tumour is confined more to one side ; in other cases the expansion is more uniform. Professor Scarpa, who has made some very valuable observations on this disease, and from the great opportunities which he had of prosecuting the subject, and his minute and accurate dissections, states, that in every case of true aneurism (and to these only I confine my present writing) the rupture of the proper coats of the artery were clearly evident. A very prevalent opinion existed, that every tumour of this description was actually oc- casioned by the dilatation of the coats of the artery, but from accurate observations, this has been found erroneous. Others thought, that the two inner coats only were ruptured, and the external, conjointly with the sheath, formed the sac, or pouch. Aneurisms appear to arise from any sudden exertion, violent shock or contusion, so that the arterial parietes are weakened and disorganized; or by increasing the lateral impulse of the fluid against the sides of the vessel; but I deem these to be both essential to their formation. Aneurisms,most commonly occur between the ages of thirty and forty ; rarely in the young, or very old .subjects: most frequently in irritable habits, and those who are addicted to debauchery and dissipation; they mostly increase gradually, and enlarge where the least resist- ance is opposed. To distinguish this disease from others, it is necessary to attend to the following discriminating remarks: when a tu- mour is seated over an artery, and the pulsation is as strong as that of aneurism, it becomes then highly necessary to be po- sitive with respect to the nature of the disease, and for this purpose the tumour is to be elevated as much as possible; if it is an aneurism, the parts so raised continue to pulsate, and vice versa; however there is another better and more discri- minating mode than this; suppose, for example, the pulsatuig

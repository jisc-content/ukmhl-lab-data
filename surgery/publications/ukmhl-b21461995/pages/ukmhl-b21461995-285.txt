LECTUilE XXIV. LECTURE XXIV. IRREDUCIBLE HERNIA. Of this species there are two kinds, one in which there is no inflammation, the other attended with strangulation. It may originate from four causes :—First, from an enlargement of the omentum, and a thickening of it by growth and pressure, and from its being considerably loaded with adeps, for now and then the omentum is of that size that it is impossible to return it. Secondly, from an adhesion of the intestine, or omentum, within the sac. Thirdly, in consequence of membranous bands formed from inflammation across the hernial sac: and lastly, from the omentum enveloping the intestine in such a manner as to prevent its return; under these circumstances the former, not the latter, adheres. An irreducible hernia is very frequently, caused by the neglect of the patient to pay due attention to himself—he allows the hernia to be down, perhaps, all day, and likewise,at night, and frequently they neglect the truss entirely, , hence the sac gradually enlarges by the weight of the tumour, more of the abdominal viscera continue to be protruded, and at last it becomes so very large as to be totally impossible to replace the contents. It will be soon found from the patient's account, whether he has ever been able to reduce it or not. After hernia has continued irreducible for some time it gets to on amazing size ; it is also at times accompanied with hydrocele. A bursting of the intestine in these cases from a blow or a fall, as was witnessed in a man in Guy's Hospital some time ago, and a person is not only exposed to this danger, but also to that equally serious — strangulation. An omental hernia, when it has long been irreducible, now and then gets scirrhous and car- u

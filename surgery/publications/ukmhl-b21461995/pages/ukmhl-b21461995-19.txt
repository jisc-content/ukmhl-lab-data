INTRODUCTORY LECTURE. Surgery consists in the application of remedies ,to external disorders, and the performance of operations. It. is divided into the Principles and Practice. The Principles are rules laid down by men of experience in all ages, to direct the judgment of the practitioner: these must be founded on three distinct parts, 1st, Observations of the'Living, when diseased; 2diy, On Dissection of the Dead ; and 3dly, Experiments on living Animals. By the first we gain a knowledge of the symptoms of the various diseases incident to the human fabric: by the second, we are led to discover their cause, and it is by dissection, and it alone, that any certainty can be obtained respecting them. Experiments have likewise been of great utility, as they have led to a know- ledge of the processes of nature in restoring injured parts, or parts that have been removed. The first effect of a wound, is loss of blood; this, however, fioon-ceases, by coagula forming in the vessels, which is the first step nature pursues towards the restoration of the part: in a few hours inflammation supervenes, which is absolutely necessary for the accomplishment of the cure ; this causes the â€¢ vessels to throw out a gluey matter, which has been denomi- nated coagulabie lymph, and if lint is applied to the wound, you will find it filled or imbibed with this gluey matter : this process is called the adhesive inflammation. If the wound is prevented uniting in this way, pus is formed by this gluey matter becoming vascular, producing granulations, and thus filling up the cavity, which the Surgeon must pro- mote by warmth and moisture.

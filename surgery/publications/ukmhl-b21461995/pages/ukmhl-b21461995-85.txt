75 LECtUEE V. Â« been accustomed to take wine, or spirits of any kind, it will be advisable to allow him them in a moderate degree, so as not to heat him too much; apply spirituous lotions, as spirits of wine and the liquor animoniae acet. and camphor combined; turpentine also, in some instances, may be applied warm; re- lieving the parts by perspiration is proper, for which pmpose the stale beer or wine lees poultices are useful; but they should not be used before fomentations and emollient cataplasms have been applied, as the latter are preferable, owing to the inflam- matory state of the parts. Hunter advises that all the applica- tions made use of should be cold; but it would be more prudent to consult the feelings of your patient, and warm ap- plications are occasionally seen to sooth and afford ease, where cold would not be productive of the same result. Opium alone, given in small doses, to ease the excessive pain suffered, will occasionally be preferable to its combination with the bark; but be careful, previous to its being administered, to open the bowels gently; these are the means used to arrest the progress of the disease. If mortification has already begun, apply stimulating poul- tices, sis those already mentioned, stale beer, wine lees, &c.; but the most advantageous poultice that the author has wit- nessed, and which has been employed from Hunter's time to the present moment, with uniform success, is crop of beer united with oatmeal, and a spoonful of yeast added to it, and applied cool, and renewed at least twice daily, by it, the pro- gress of the mortification becomes checked, a separation from the living parts-effected, and a secretion of healthy matter pro- duced. At the same time give decoction of bark internally, either combined with ammonia or opium, in small doses. If a diarrhoea is induced, unite the bark and opium with the aro- matic confection; this has been found to check it; but if it should be prolonged, give the mistura cretae with opium. If the patient is delirious, apply a large blister on the nape of his neck, and internally give the camphorated mixture, with musk. Bark, in mortification, is combined with other medicines, by some, as the sulphuric acid, by others, altogether omitted, and ammonia, opium, or musk, substituted; in some patients, bark

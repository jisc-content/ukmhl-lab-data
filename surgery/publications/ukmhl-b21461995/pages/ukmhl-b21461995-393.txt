LECTURE XXXI. some time, sores will break out upon the penis, and those have been thought venereal, but are no such ulcers; being entirely mercurial, caused by the Jong continuance of the medicine • they certamly resemble chancres in some degree, being ragged and sloughy; but they have not that circumscribed circle of inflammation around them which chancres have, nor have the surrounding thickening: they have mostly a good deal of in- flammation extending about them. These ulcerations will soon heal. If they are frequently washed with warm milk and water and the parts afterwards covered with dry lint. ' With respect to bubo, if the patient has not had a precedin^r chancre, J. ought not to be considered as venereal; on account of the glands in the groin becoming enlarged from a great variety of causes, independent of venereal matter. But now and then, a chancre will spontaneously heal, in which case, if a bubo IS present, the penis must be examined; when if one has existed, there will be found some degree of hardness remainin<. which will point out the situation of it. ° If several of the inguinal glands are Enlarged, the disease will scarcely ever be found venereal, but generally either sympathe- tic or scrophulous. j t- ^ With regard to sores in the throat, there are several kinds which may be confounded with venereal, viz. scrophulous'; those arising from debility, independent of scrophula, and those which owe their origin to the free use of mercury. The venereal are esemblmg chancre m every respect; the mercurial are similar to phagedenic ulcers as before described : the scrophulous ge- nmlly begin by an enlargement of the tonsil glands, and when Aey are pressed from the outside, quantities of saniL matter "111 be forced out of their follicles.

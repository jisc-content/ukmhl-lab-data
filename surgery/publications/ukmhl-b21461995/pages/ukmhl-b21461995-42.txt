The term is derived from inflammo, to burn. When inflammation occurs externally, it is denoted by four marks or signs, which attend it; these are, redness on the part, pain, swelling, and increased heat. It is defined by Mr. Hun- ter to be a process occasioning, in a given time, and from one immediate cause, the following effects only; pain, swelling, and redness ; increased heat is not admitted. The redness is owing to a great quantity of blood being de- termined to the part, and distending the vessels which before contained only the transparent particles. This is often remark- able in the tunica conjunctiva of the eye. The swelling in a tumour, proceeds from the effusion of coagulable lymph in the centre, surrounded by serum. The cause of pain is conjectured and supposed to arise from the distension of the blood vessels of the nerves, and thus making pressure on them. A part inflamed is infinitely more susceptible of pain than the same part when in a state of health. An encysted tumour has been removed from a lady with scarcely any pain being expressed, while the mere opening of an abcess, where the integuments were inflamed, has caused apparent tortures ; therefore it would at all times be desirable in ampu- tation to cut, if possible, above all inflammation, for if a cut is made into an inflamed part, besides that of giving exquisite pain, the stump will scarcely ever do so well. This is remarkable in hydrocele, when uninflamed, the injec-

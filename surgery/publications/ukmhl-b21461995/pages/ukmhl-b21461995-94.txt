LECTXTUE VJl. 84 LECTURE Vir. ON WOUNDS. Wounds are divided into four kinds :â€”the incised, or those "vvhich are occasioned by some cutting instrument; the lace- rated, or those which are caused by parts being violently torn asunder; the contused, or that species arising from a blow^ happening to a part, by which the vitality of that part is de- stroyed ; and lastly, and fourthly, the punctured, or those made by a sharp pointed instrument: of all the varieties of wounds, these are the most to be dreaded, on account both of their more immediate as well as remote effects; from this description of wounds arise the locked jaw, &c. &c. OF THE INCISED "WOUND. The direct effect of this species of wounds, is, besides the separation of the parts, the immediate discharge of a quantity of blood, greater or less, according to the magnitude of the vessels divided. The more remote effect is that of inflamma- tion, and in the course of a very few hours the wound becomes covered with a gluey matter ; the first object required is to put a stop to the hEemorrhage, and this should always be done by means of pressure, if it is possible. It is always better to avoid applying ligatures if they can be done without, and in general, pressure, made for the space of five miimtes, will be sufficient to stop the bleeding, more particularly if assisted by a dossil of lint on the wound. This suppression of haemorrhage arises from the coagulation of blood*around the extremities^of the divided vessels, as well as in the mouths themselves. Then the subsequent inflammation, which always supervenes, is taken advantage of, in order to facilitate a cure of the w^ound, the edges are brought together by means of adhesive plaster, and

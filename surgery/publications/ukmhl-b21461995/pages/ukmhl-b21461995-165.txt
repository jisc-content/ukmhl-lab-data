•LECTURE XIII. 155 excess • however, as a neighbour stated, he fell on his head: as a measure of precaution, I only gave him a purgative medi- cine, as it was late at night, and the following morning, early, I ao-ain saw him, when the symptoms were more decided, and I pursued the usual means, as will be hereafter detailed:— being the father of a large family, whose anxiety on his account v'ere great, induced me to pay him the very greatest attention, but it was several months before he recovered notwithstanding. In the case of a surgeon's mate, mentioned by Sir Everard Home, the effects of such an injury were protracted to a much more remote period: at the end of six months he was in a great measure recovered, but wanted the power of walking straight, and had lost his memory: his complete recovery did not happen till the end of twelve months. This depends en- tirely upon the nature and extent of the injury. To distinguish concussion of the brain from other injuries of that important organ, it will merely be necessary to state the symptoms, particularly marking this injury, and this will lead to the distinguishing it from others: many of these I have before-mentioned, but some of them accompany other injuries of the head. A blow on the head often produces symptoms not before existing. The respiration, as I have before observed above, is free, unless some exertion is used. The symptoms come on immcdialely afler the accident: the pulse at the time pretty regular, soon becomes quicker and fuller: simple con- cussion causes another action of the brain, by which its func- tions are deranged, and the action of its vessels are increased: but this does not last a great while, as the brain sets about im- mediately to restore the injury which it has received; and which, if the blow inflicted is not violent, it soon affects : the pupil of the eye will be observed immoveable; the extremities cold, and the muscles of the limbs are not relaxed, as in the state of compression. In the treatment of concussion we are generally led to the same method as that of inflammation, and it should always be considered in that light. As vomiting comes on commonly m this affection, many practitioners, when this is not the case, endeavour to excite by medicines that effect: perhaps there

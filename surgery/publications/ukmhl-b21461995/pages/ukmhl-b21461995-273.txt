263 LECTURE XXH. the cut is made through more muscular parts. It is very simi- lar to the operation below the knee—a circular incision through tlie integuments, which are to be drawn up suflficient to cover the stump, another cut through the muscles, then use the catlin to sever those parts between the bones, and in sawing turn the hand upwards, stand on the outer side, and saw both bpnes through at once : four arteries require ligatures, the radial, ulnar, and two interosseal. The operation at the arm is exactly similar to the thigh, the structure of the parts being much alike. If very high up, the artery cannot be compressed with the pad of the tourniquet; it then must be firmly pressed on as it passes "over the first rib by an assistant—the principal artery is the brachial, but small branches will now and then require ligatures. Some knowing ones made a whole sheet of this operation ; after a circular incision is made, the biceps is to be divided, then the muscles in front of the arm bending the elbow, then straightening it, the triceps may be cut through, next the brachialis internus, &c.; all this is very amusing, no doubt, but I have too much respect for the junior members of the profession, to desire they will retain more of this detail than they can rationally digest, which puzzled me at first to know what it meant. Shoulder JOINT.—This operation, it is found, may be done with great safety, even when there is considerable enlargement of the limb, as from exostosis, &c. It may be performed in two ways : First cut down and secure the axillary artery, which will be found concealed by the nerves of the brachial plexus, some of which it will be found impossible to avoid dividing without very great care is taken, then make a flap of the deltoid muscle, cutting it upwards until the head of the os humeri is exposed, forming the angles of the Hap above, so as to make it of a semi-circular form, and if the circumflex arteries bleed freely, they must be immediately secured--then carry the incision round the under part of the limb until the bone is here again exposed, incline the bone upwards and backwards, and a cut can easily be made into the joint at the under part, and dividhig the capsular ligament, the head of the bone is easily dislocated from the glenoid cavity of the scapula, then bringing down the

LECTURE Vll. 87 merly, if the periosteum was separated from the tibia, for instance it was the practice to cut it off, which occasioned tedious exfoliations : whereas, had it been laid down, it would have united in a short time, and prevented the necessity at all for so tedious a process. With respect to this union, it will be found not to hold good in the attempt of uniting the articulating cartilages and the cel- lular membrane, or common integuments : one of these is laid bare, as in removing a linger, and the integuments are brought over it, as in the common amputation of a large extremity, they never become united to the cartilage, from a cavity being left, in which a fluid is secreted, w-hich causes a tumour in the extremity of the stump ; therefore as this is now well known to happen, surgeons generally pare off the articulating cartilage, until the bones bleed, from which surface granulations arise, which will be sufficiently vascular to unite by the adhesive inflammation. We are not to be deterred from attempting union by this process, even though the parts are much separated; for if they remain attached by a very small piece of integument alone, they will often unite, though apparently no chance of it existed. A case might here be adduced, which occured in a near relation of Mr. Astley Cooper's':â€”A boy playing with a dog, enraged him, when the animal seized the lad* by the nose, and nearly bit it off; it hanged down by a small portion of the cartilaginous septum : the parts being immediately brought together, in the regular situation, so good an union took place, that the scar is scarcely perceptible, and no deformity is apparent. When Tippoo Saib, or Hyder Ali, took any English or Se- poys in the Mysorean wars, it was their general custom to cut off their noses, by which they were able to know them again when taken, when they invariably were put to death. In these cases, the native surgeons were in the habit of cutting a trian- gular piece of integuments from the forehead, twisting it half round, but not entirely separating it, and bringing it in such a manner as to form a nose; the' edges of the old wound on the face were pared off, and the edges of the skin brought down were inserted into the face ; the form of the nose was sup- ported by parchment, or any other convenient substance, stuffed

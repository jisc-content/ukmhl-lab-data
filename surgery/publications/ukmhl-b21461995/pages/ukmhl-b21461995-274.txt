One objection to this mode of operating, is that the flap does not unite to the glenoid cavity, this latter being a secreting sur- face, and covered with cartilage ; the secretion accumulates, and sinuses are formed from ensuing inflammation ; to counteract this objection, the cartilage of the glenoid cavity must be scraped ofl"; thus the secretion will be prevented, and granulations will arise, which will unite with the flap. Second mode.—If there is any enlargement of the os hu- meri or other cause, that a flap cannot be made of the deltoid muscle, a double flap may thus be formed—secure the artery as before, then make an incision obliquely at the anterior and upper part of the arm, carrying it down to the axilla, so as to form a flap, then make another incision on the opposite side,exactly similar, commencing at the upper point of the first incision, and meeting it below; the head of the os humeri being exposed, turn the arm backwards, and by cutting through the capsular ligament, the joint is easily separated; the cartilage must be cut off from the glenoid cavity, the arteries must be secured by liga- tures as in the other operation, then bring the flaps together. This I conceive makes a much neater stump, and one which will possess more living powers than the single flap, and I have understood two surgeons of eminence intend adopting this plan; besides the circumflex, the superior scapular artery, which is large, will require a ligature, and also various communicating branches. I think in both these operations it will be better not to secure the axillary artery in the first instance by ligature, pressure pro- perly made on the artery as it crosses the first rib will be suf- ficient to restrain haemorrhage till the operation is complete, ■when it may be secured with the others. Remarks.—When ligatures remain a great while, they should be drawn tight every day, by means of a small piece of wood orbougie twisted round their ends.—I have again to observe that the first dressing after amputation should not be removed under a week. In gun shot wounds, where the head of the os humeri is shattered, Baron Larrey, and other military surgeons, have suc=

It is marked by an increased size of the abdomen, a ravenous appetite, and if the stools are examined, matter similar to chyld will be found in them : this, in fact, is chyle, M'hich is not taken up by the lacteals, owing to an obstruction in these glands.

These are generally denonnnated White Swellings, from the iiiteguments on the surface preserving their original unniflamed colour. Scrophulous diseases of the joints are divided mto three stages, the adhesive, the suppurative and the ulcerative. Similar to the enlargement of glands, the disease in these parts is very slow in its progress, remaining for weeks, and some-

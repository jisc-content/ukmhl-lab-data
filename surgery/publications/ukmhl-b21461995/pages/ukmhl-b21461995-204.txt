lQ4i LECTUHE XVi. LECTURE XVI. ON CATARACT. Cataract is clerived from KOir(x,^a<r&a, to confound, or dis- turb, because the sense of vision is confounded, if not destroy- ed : it means an opacity of the chrystalline lens, that obscures the sight. There are two kinds of cataract, the one termed the chrystalline, the other the capsular; the former when the humour alone is aflfected, the latter when its capsule is : these are often found both to be combined in the same subject. At the commencement, the pa:tient complains of an indistinctness in vision, as if a cloud hung over his eyes, or the objects were enveloped in a mist; he observes a body floating before him : this latter symptom sometimes occurs when there; i's no cata- ract, as in an affection of the optic nerve, but if may be dis- tinguished from this disease by thes^ circumstances; when, the nerve is affected several bodies are observed floating before the eyes, but not jixed, so that they continually appear to be in motion; whereas, in cataract, it is only a single body, and stationary: as the disorder advances, objects become very in- distinct in a glaring light, from the contraction of the pupil; but in the shade, from the enlargement and dilatation of the pupil, they become more obvious : as it continues to increase, although ultimately vision is perfectly obscured from discern- ing objects, the rays of light are not altogether prevented from passing to the retina, so that if a hand is placed between the patient's eye and a candle, he will be able to know that there is a something before him, though he cannot describe what it is. When on trial this is found not to be the case, it may fairly be suspected to be complicated with gutta serena. In the progress of the disease, previous to its being so matured,

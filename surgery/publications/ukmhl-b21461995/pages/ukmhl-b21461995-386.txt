376 LECTURE XXXI. being ascertained to exist, the most prompt measures must be undertaken, in order to prevent this danger. The use of mer- cury has an extremely quick effect in checking the progress of the disease. The hydrarg. muriat. in sokition must be given along with the decoction of sarsaparijla. When the symptoms are a little abated, but not before, mercurial frictioujs jaiay be had recourse to. VENEREAL DISEASE OF THE BONES. Many bones of the body are liable to the attack of the dis- ease, but the nasal bones seem more susceptible than any others. These are often affected, and the first symptom which denotes the existence of the disease, is a painful sensa- tion extending across the bridge of the nose between the eyes ; a tenderness is perceptible here on pressing with the fingers; then the skin becomes red, and large scabs, lined with blood and matter, are discharged from this part on blowing the nose : afterwards the bones exfoliate. The greatest part of the vo- mer has been discharged by the exfoliating process. Occa- sionally the ossa nasi are also destroyed in this manner, in which case the nose falls in, and permanent defornnty remains. Much of the disfiguration may be prevented by taking away the por- tions of bone as they decay. The general treatment is to be the same as in eruptions, but the local treatment differs: here a solution of any mineral acid must be made, and a small quan- tity must be snuffed up the nose, by putting the fluid on the hand; if this cannot be done, a syringe must be employed to inject it up. This will have the effect of correcting the great, and extremely disagreeable faetor, which is always present when this disease exists in bones, and at the same time the exfoliation will be expedited.

The next seat is between the heart and the curvature of the aorta, but this is not very common; if it forms beyond the curvature, or what is then called the ascend- ing aorta, it will prove fatal by its pressure upon the trachea and oesophagus, preventing ultimately the admission of air, as well as the power of deglutition, and this often before it has advanced very materially in size. When seated in the cavity of the abdomen, if above the superior or lesser curvature of the stomach, it occasions the rejection of every thing swallowed ; if it forms in the beginning of the mesenteric arterv, here its pressure is below the stomach, and the functions of the intes- tinal canal are not impeded: the situation and pulsation may be felt by placing the patient iu an horizontal position, with his shoulders elevated, and making pressure with one hand on the abdomen. Aneurisms are sometimes seated in the abdo- men, in the posterior part of the aorta, and pressing internally and laterally towards the spine and loins; here an aneurism may be easily mistaken for an abscess; an instance of this oc- curred in St. Thomas's Hospital, when the susgeon, taking it for an abscess, made an opening into it with a lancet, and im- mediately there was a sanious and bloody discharge: he being aware of his error, stopped the heemorrhage directly with lint, bandage, &c.: other similar mistakes maybe recorded. Aneu- risms also occasionally form in the ischiatic notch, or under the gluteus maximus muscle. When aneurism occurs in the limbs, its situation is most fre- quently opposite the joints, and the reason is, that in conse- quence of the frequent flexion and use of them, the blood is more likely to be interrupted in its course. Hence, on this principle it is, that popliteal aneurism ensues so frequently.

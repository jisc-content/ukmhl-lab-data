LECTUHE XXXII. gg^ When the patella is fractured transversely, the upper portion lis drawn up from the lower by the action of the rectus and vasti muscles, to some distance between one and six inches. This accident happens most frequently from falling upon the knee and occasionally (though much less often) by the action of the muscles (those above-mentioned) alone, in jumping down stairs, &c. In consequence of the great separation which ensues' union is hardly ever etFected by bone, but by a ligamentous kind of substance, this being supplied with vessels from the adjacent ligaments of the bone or joint. The etfect of which is, that the bone being separated to a much greater distance than what it had been before, a weakness is produced in the extremity, which is seldom or ever recovered from, and owing to the weakness, the opposite is required to exert more force in exercise, and is' often broken a short time afterwards. if, by way of experiment, to ascertain the mode of union, and the advance made in it at different periods, the patella of a dog IS divided : in one week afterwards, the coagulum of blood which had existed to this time, between the portions of bone, is found to be absorbed, and a deposition of lymph occupying'its place : in two weeks, the union is completed by the formation of a firm but ligamentous substance, uniting the separated portions. Treatment. In the first instance, the inflammation must be moderated by leeches, and a vinegar poultice for four or five days, when bandages may be put on, but not before the inflammatory symp- toms have subsided; there is often tension and swelling in the parts, so that bandages would be improper until this time When a roller as used, a cushion ought to be placed over the" upper portion of bone, and put the roller on in the form of a figure of eight; the crossing of the bandage ought to be in the ham, the lowest portion passing over the head of the tibia. The bones should not be forcibly pressed down on the first applica- tion but It must be got lower daily, and the bandage must be gradually tightened to retain it in the position it is pressed into, lo prevent a stiffness in the joint, passive motion must be used m four or five- weeks after the accident has happened. The patient may be placed on a table with his leg hanging down

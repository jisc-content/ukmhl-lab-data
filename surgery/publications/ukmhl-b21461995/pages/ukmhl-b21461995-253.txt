Besides, in the hydatid testicle it yields like dough, or similar to anasarca. When there is a doubt, however, by applying a lighted candle it will not be observed to be transparent. Its weight also is much greater than that of hydrocele, and of a more solid texture. The form is not pyramidal, as that of the testes is much preserved, and a distinction can evidently be discovered between the latter and the epididimis. To remove all doubt on the subject, it will be right, previous to the performance of any operation, to make a puncture with a lancet, and if no fluid escapes, then there will be no hesitation as to its nature; and it may be right here just to observe, to prevent the injury of a person's character with respect to a false opinion delivered as to the nature of the disease, that when a professional man is asked by the patient respecting a complaint of this kind where any difficulty exists of ascertaining it, to give him an indirect answer; and I should always make it a rule to puncture with a lancet before I would castrate any disease of the testicle, as since there will be every probability of its removal, this small opening cannot injure it, and yet it may sometimes prove of great advantage. 1 remember a case related during my at- ' tendance in town, -where a surgeon of skill in his profession had removed the testicle, and on examining it afterwards, found that there was rather an obscure hydrocele in the vaginal tunic; so that here the testicle was unnecessarily extirpated, and might have been prevented by only attending to the preceding pre- caution. The operation for removing the hydatid testicle becomes ne- cessary from its great size, though the disease has not extended to the abdomen : on examining it after extirpation, a number of bags or cysts are found on the side of the testis of various sizes, and the state of the fluid is always very diff'erent, some- times of a yellowish colour and ropy, at other times inflamma- tion has gone on to suppuration: the coats of the cysts are extremely vascular. The second disease of the testes that I shall remark on, is

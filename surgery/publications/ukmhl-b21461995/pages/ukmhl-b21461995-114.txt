104, LECTURE IX. commends a portion of the fibula to be sawed ofif; but it is not, except in very rare cases indeed, in the least degree necessary, as the vessel may always be found by making an incision close to the inner side of the bone where it lies. The anterior tibial artery in like manner, to the posterior, is very difficult of access, when requiring to be tied at its upper extremity, but when lower down, it is easily discovered. In a case published by Mr. White, this vessel was wounded high up, and he used sponge with success ; and this mode of treat- ment would be advisable, as the difficulty of tying it is great: when wounded on the foot, it is very evident to the feel, and ought to be secured. LECTURE IX. ON WOUNDS OF VEINS. The largest vein that can be found on the external surface of the body may be wounded without any serious consequences resulting from it. The axillary vein is sometimes injured dur- ing an operation for the extirpation of the lymphatic glands in the axilla, yet the haemorrhage, from this large vessel, may be easily restrained by the application of a dossil of lint to the mouth of the bleeding vein. The femoral vein, close to Pou- part's ligament, has been seen to be completely divided by a gun-shot without any immediate bad effects, though from the nature of the wound, the patient ultimately died. Although it may be said that generally no important consequences will follow the division of a large vein, yet, if inflammation takes place in the vessel, dangerous symptoms will arise, though the divided vessel be only of the second or thir 1 class in point of magnitude. The truth of this remark is amply proved by numerous examples. In the simple operation of bleeding,

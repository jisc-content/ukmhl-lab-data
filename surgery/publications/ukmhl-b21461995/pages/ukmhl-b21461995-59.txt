LECTURE IV. 49 patients, in these case?, are to be considered in imminent dan- ger, though not at first generally so. The second use it serves,,is in dividing a'cavity into several parts, so that if inflammation ,comes on in any one part, and pus forms, by this process taking place, and glueing the sides of this cavity together, the inflammation is prevented from spreading farther. Thirdly, in case of any extraneous body, such as for ex- ample, a musket or pistol ball received into any part of the body, this lymph, by forming a cyst, encases this extraneous body, and the parts around it are not stimulated to do any fur- ther injury; ?nd cases where extraneous substances have so remained in the body for a length of time, with impunity, and without any very manifest inconvenience, will be detailed in the course of the series of Lectures. Fourthly, to unite paits together which have been divided, and which is considered as the most essential of its uses. A very wrong opinion has prevailed, that extravasation of blood produces what is called the first intention, which is now evi- dent can only be answered by coagulable lymph ; for example, in the operation for the hare-lip, it has been invariably ob- served that the less the loss of blood the better. For the accomplishment of the union of parts, it is abso- lutely necessary that inflammdlion should first come on, and during its early progress the lymph is thrown out, which answers every purpose required. There are two modes of union, the one already mentioned, namely, adhesion, the other by granulations; if there be any exception to this, it is in those blood vessels at their mouths or extremities, when we find the haemorrhage stopped by a coa- gulum or clot of blood ; but here ultimately the union is effect- ed by the medium of lymph, which causes an adhesion of the clot to the inside and orifice'of the artery, and to the surrround- ing parts; and, in bad habits, the increase or recurrence of heemorrhage is from a deficiency of this action, and after the ligature operates, the ends not being glued together, nor the clot of blood to the sides of the artery, it is carried away by the force of the blood.

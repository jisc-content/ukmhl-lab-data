LECTURE I. X SHALL commence the series with a few preliminary remarks, which will render more intelligible the subjects hereafter to be discussed. The natural temperature of the blood, while cir- culating in the body is 98 degrees of Farenheit's thermometer; the pulsations of the heart in a state of health from 60 to 84 degrees in a minute, the medium is 72, which may be con- sidered the natural standard. The pulsations, with respect to respiration, ipay be considered nearly as 4 to 1, or rather 7 pul- sations of the heart to 2 respirations in the adult: in children the pulse is much more frequent, in old age less so ; and the smaller in proportion the animal is, the more frequent is the circulation : in children the pulse is very quick.* In the brute creation, as for instance, the horse, we cannot distinguish above 32 or 37 in a minute; in the dog 130. The pulse becomes much accelerated in fevers, from 72 it has rose to 120,130, 150 and even 160 in a minute, nay, so quick that it cannot be ascer- tained, and beyond 165 it will be impossible to count it; the lowest pulse ever known was from 13 or 14 to 28 pulsations, observed by Dr. Cholmleyand Mr. Stocker. There are many variations in the pulse denoting the state of the circulation; the action of the heart may be diminished, increased or changed; as a stronger or weaker pulse than natural, a contracted one, a harder or softer, and sometimes irregular or intermittent. A temperature from 60" to 64Â° admits with ease and safety eyery exertion necessary either to our subsistence or pleasure, hence * According to Heberden and Blumenbach, in infants at birth, the pulse is 140 ; first year 124; second 110 ; third and fourth 96; seventh 80 J at puberty 80} mauhogd, or 21 years old 76 ; sixty yeaM Ol age 60.

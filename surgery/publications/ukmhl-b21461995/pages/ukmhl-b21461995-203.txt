LECTURE XV. 193 ing with a lancet, by which a tumour is formed, from the effu- sion of blood into tlie adjacent vein; it is denoted by a kind of tremulous motion in the vein, and by a peculiar hissing sound; the swelling will not be less by compressing the vein below; but if pressure is made on the artery, it will almost entirely disappear. I saw a married woman, who had been thus in- jured by a country operator; a tumour had formed, which alarmed her a good deal; it had, however, by constant pressure, at the time I saw it last, almost disappeared. A circumscribed or diffused aneurism is from a wound of an artery only, by which the blood*, is effused into the cellular membrane; it has also been named a false aneurism; it hap- pens thus:â€”I shall say, for instance, the brachial artery is wounded, and the wound being small, an attempt is made by pressure to close it; this probal)ly may not be sufficient, or not continued sufficiently long, or applied in such a way as totally to obstruct the escape of blood, hence an effusion takes place into the adjoining cellnlar membrane. This last disease may require the brachial artery to be se- cured in a similar manner to that of an aneurism forming from absorption of the coats of the artery: the vessel is very readily found on the inner edge of the biceps, the artery is accompa- nied by the median vein and nerve, and care must be taken not to secure either in the ligature; one ligature is sufficient, and no division necessary: merely securing the vessel above, or at some little distance from the tumour, will be amply sufficient. Tn an aneurism of the ulnar artery, high up, it will be neces- sary to secure the brachial; if at the wrist, probably opening the sac, and making a ligature on the ulnar artery, above and below, would be most proper.

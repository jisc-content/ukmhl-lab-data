tEC'TURE XXXI. ggj good health as usual. Even before the appearance of vene- real eruptions, febrile symptoms have been known to occur for the space of several days; awd this has been treated as pro- ceeding from general causes until the skin became diseased which evinced the nature of the complaint: the increase in the seventy of the symptoms occurring in the evening is now considered to be constitutional. The matter produced from the secondary ulcer differs very much from that discharged in diancre, having no power to com mumcate the disease when applied upon the skin, or mserted under it by inoculation. This discovery was made (amone numberless others) by Mr. Hunter, who made many experi ments, m order to verify the truth of it; and since his time others have followed his steps, and similar tests have been made at almost all the hospitals in town, all of which coincide with those made hy him. The matter from a sore throat not being able to communicate the disease, it will therefore be im possible to be infected by kissing a person who has venereal ulcers, as they-cannot transmit the disease to another and it can only be done by chancre ; thus there are only chancre and gonorrhoea from which the two diseases can be caught- the matter from the latter is very liable to produce the disease-it behoves surgeons to be extremely careful respectincr their in struments, &c. Bougies ^vhich have been introduced into the urethra of a person labouring under gonorrhoea, will certainly produce the disease if passed afterwards into that of a person m health. A case of this kiÂ«d occurred some time ago-an old man of seventy caught a severe clap, by having an elastic ca theter introduced which had previously been used on a person who had a gonorrhoea. person I have already remarked that it has been ascertained in the most satisfactory manner, that the matter of gonorrhoea whin any other venereal disease : the experiment has been made so xT: lit:''''^^'-'e-

334 LECTURE XXIX. gie can be p^sed into the bladder, one of the largest size must be used each time of passing it, until the canal has regained its original size : when this is done, the patient should be in- structed how to use and pass it himself, and he should be ad- vised to introduce it into the bladder every two or three weeks, otherwise the stricture will be apt to return as bad as ever. The metallic bougies are not so good as the wax ones; they give more pain, and do not adapt diemselves to the form of the urethra as well as those made of wax : besides, the latter seldom produce haemorrhage from the canal by passing through or injuring its coats, as they will bend when impelled against the sides : such an accident as injuring the membrane, will often lay the foundation of future strictures. A catheter may be introduced into the bladder when a bougie will, or cannot pass, and it is always better to attempt the introduction of it, previous to using the caustic bougie. The catgut bougie is not a good one, though it may be of use to dilate the strictured part when the opening is very small. It will be right to in- crease the size of the bougie, in such cases, almost daily, until the passage is restored. Supposing that neither a bougie or catheter, however small in size, cannot be introduced, recourse must be had to the caustic one. In making use of it, take one of a good size, as large as the urethra will admit of, and I think those charged with the nitrate of silver are the best: the kali purum irritates the urethra more than the former; besides, it dissolves more readily, and will be much more liable to induce inflammation around the stricture,: the nitrate of silver being less soluble, will have its effects confined more to the strictured part. Prior to using the armed bougie, a common should be passed, to ascertain exactly how far down the disease is seated, and also to dilate the passage; it should be larger than the caustic one, and the distance on the latter must be marked, so that it may be known when it has reached the stricture. The caustic bougie must be passed as quickly as possible, and then suffered to remain in the urethra a longer or shorter time, ac- cording to the irritability of the patient, and according to the frequency of using it: half a minute every other, or second day, will be enough at first, allowing the slough to separate on the

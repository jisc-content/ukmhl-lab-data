56 LECTURE IV. these facts are shewn in the case of fis ula lacrymalls, for though the collected matter is nearest the cavity of the nose, still it makes its way externally, and the Schneideriaa membrane be- comes thickened, so as to prove a barrier against its progress inwardly. He gives five causes for ulcerative absorption, pres- sure, irritation of stimulating substances, weakness, inutility of parts, and death of them. It takes place readier in the cellular and adipose substance, than in muscular, tendinous, ligamentous, and nervous substances, or blood-vessels. A cicatrix, or newly-formed skin, is sooner acted on, than the originally formed cutis; thus, if an infiammation takes place in a patient's leg, that had been previously affected with ulceration, the ulcer will break out much sooner than if the disease had not existed prior to this last inflammation. In fractured limbs also when callous forms, they are much more likely to be broken again, than if no such accident had happened; to illustrate this, it will be only necessary to recol- lect what occurred in Lord Anson's Voyages, where those sea- men who were afflicted with scurvy, had old ulcers breaking out afresh, and those that were of this habit, to a great degree, even had those bones which had been united by callous, again loosened. The progress of ulceration takes place much quicker than that of restoration, as parts may be so affected as to be de- stroyed in two or three days, which for their restoration would require twice as many weeks. Ulceration, although a diseased process, yet is not without its advantages to the body and animal economy, by discharging â– extraneous bodies from the system ; as for instance, a ball; a ligature upon an artery is disengaged in the same manner; sloughing parts are also similarly removed; parts having weak circulating or living powers, are more readily acted upon by absorption, as we oftener see ulcers in the legs than other situations. When the body has been long accustomed t6 the discharge of matter, it is absolutely necessary in stopping this, to sub- stitute other evacuations in its room, or the change will be, to produce apoplexy, or a peripneumonia; these consequences

LECTURE XIII. 159 Previous- to trephining, supposing it were proper, we should bleed freely, and take care to evacuate the bowels: if the syniptdnjs continue undiminished, we should not hesitate about the operation, as the risk in its performance is not equal to its neglect, and will be the only chance of preserving life. Look carefully at every part of the skull, and make pressure around it with the finger; if by doing so any pain or uneasiness is ex- cited in a particular part, there the trephine should be applied. It has been the practice to operate on any part that has been bruised, but I think with a degree of hazard, as it is often found that blood is extravasated on the opposite side of the head: after having made the opening with a scalpel, if we should notjind the pericranium detached from the skull (which will be the case if there is any fluid between the dura mater and the cranium), I do not conceive we are warranted in pro- ceeding any further, except in one m^awce, which is, if a blow has been received on the lower part of the parietal bone, just where the artery enters ; and if the symptoms should be violent, in this case I would advise trephining, as it is commonly observed in dissection.of these cases a fluid extravasated be- tween the dura matral artery and bone, from the vessel yielding to the violence of the blow. The operation of trephining is very generally given up, except in cases of fractures; but it may be proper under two circumstances, in a limited way,'namely, from extravasation and depression; and in some cases it requires the greatest judg- ment to distinguish, as to its propriety or not. ON FRACTURES OF THE CRANIUM. These are to be considered in the same light as other frac- tures, when unaccompanied with extravasation or depression. It is no uncommon thing to see patients brought into the Lon- don hospitals, with simple fractures, which do very well. I saw an instance, where a man was brought in with a fracture of the cranium, attended with symptoms rather violent: he was. immediately bled freely on his admission, and by the time the surgeon arrived, under \Yhose care he was taken in,, he.was

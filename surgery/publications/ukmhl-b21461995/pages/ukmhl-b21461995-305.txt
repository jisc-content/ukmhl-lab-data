LECTURE XXV. « surgeon to suppose some disease of the chord existed. It has been mistaken for inguinal hernia, and the operation performed. In tlie reducible state it requires the oblique truss. In the irreducible, the same treatment is proper as has been already noticed; but it is somewhat different when strangulated, as the surgeon has not the same power of reducing it as in the other species. The stricture is generally at the upper opening, and rarely at the abdominal ring, for this reason, that the parts, from the long application of a truss, become so much thickened as to prevent its occurring in the last stated situation. In operating the cut is not to be made so low as the testes, and it is necessary to have a sufficient portion of the tmiica va- ginalis to cover the testes; but it should, at the same time, be recollected, that the incision must be carried downwards, rather more than an inch from the abdominal ring. After the stricture is divided, which is to be cautiously done with a bis- toury, carrying a finger or director to serve as a guide, return the contents. There is another species of hernia lately discovered by Mr, Hey, of Leeds, which is called the encysted ; in which there is a complete cyst within the vaginal tunic, forming the hernial sac. The manner in which it occurs is this:—the tunica vagi- nalis, instead of being closed at its orifice perfectly, adhesions form across it, shutting up the ring: these adhesions become elongated by the pressure of the intestine, and a pouch is formed, which, by continual pressure, becomes so extended as to reach as far as the testis itself. When a hernia of this kind becomes strangulated, it renders the operation more complin pated and difficult: the only peculiarity is the addilioijal cover- ing.

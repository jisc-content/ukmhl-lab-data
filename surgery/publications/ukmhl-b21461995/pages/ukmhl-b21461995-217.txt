ON FISTULA LACRYMALIS. This is a disease in which the natural course of the tears is obstructed, in consequence of a stricture, or closure in the membrane lining the ductus ad nasum : in whatever state it is found, whether there is a sinus or not, yet it takes this name. There are three states of the disease : the Jirst is a simple en- largement of the lacrymal sac, denoted by a tumour on the internal canthus, which if large and distended, extends one- third above the tendon of the orbicularis muscle; the skin over the tumour is undiscoloured, and scarcely any pain felt: when the patient is exposed to the cold or wind, the tears flow down over the cheeks. If the further progress of the disease is not arrested, then the second state is formed, inflammation takes place, the tumour becomes red and painful, and the eyelids much swollen : on pressing the tumour, instead of a jelly-like matter, a muqus first presents, then pus is discharged mixed with tears. The third state is the true fistula lacrymalis : when the inner part of the sac becomes inflamed, suppuration takes place from the irritation of the tears, and an abscess forms, not directly opposite the sac itself, but below it—at length the ulcerative process forms a fistulous orifice a little below the inner corner of the eye, about half an inch from the lacrymal sac; a fungus projection of the orifice now takes place, for which caustics have often been used with but little success, and only attended with temporary relief, and not to be renaoved effectually without an operation. When the ulcera- tive orifice, or opening, is thus established in the inner canthus of the eye, the tears will pass that way, and prevent its healing; occasionally the os unguis gets carious from this affection, and the other eye becomes weak and inflamed; hence the tears

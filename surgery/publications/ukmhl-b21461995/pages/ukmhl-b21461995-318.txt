A dislocation of this bone, may happen at either extre- mity; when separated from the sternum there is a tumour susceptible, and the clavicle is either thrown forwards or backwards. By drawing the scapular extremity backwards, and making pressure on the sternal extremity, it is easily re- duced. The scapular end is oftener dislocated than the other; it is thrown upwards on the processus acromion : carry your finger along the spine of the scapula to the acromion, when you will feel the clavicle : this accident is liable to be mistaken for a dislocation of the os humeri. By drawing the shoulder back- wards, and pressing down the end of the clavicle, it regains its situation. In both these accidents the arm had better be kept in a sling after the reduction: but notwithstanding, deformity very often remains. OS HUMERI. The shoulder joint is liable to three different kinds of dislo- cation : first, downwards, which is the most common, into the axilla: in this case the h^ad of the bone is situated between the glenoid cavity and ribs, and there are four signs which will denote the nature of this accident: first, the shoulder will ap- pear sunk and flat, and a vacancy is plainly distinguishable under the acromion; secondly, the elbow cannot be brought to the side, because the triceps muscle is on the stretch, which permits this motion; thirdly, the patient cannot bring his hand to the top of his head, neither can it be raised in a line parallel with the acromion; and fourthly, the feeling the head of the bone in the axilla, which will be facilitated by casting the el- bow as far from the side as possible; the lower edge of the Jectoral muscle is drawn tightâ€”the arm is longer than the other. Having ascertained the nature of the accident, proceed to the reduction, by placing the patient upon a chair; put a towel in the axilla, under the dislocated shoulder, and tie it tight over

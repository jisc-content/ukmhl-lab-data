LECTURE XV. scripts I have by me, it would appeear to be the result of nu- merous experiments made by him, from reflections on this sub- ject to ascertain the probability of a substitute for the old mode, but which, with all due deference for his great abilities, he states himself, with his usual characteristic candour, he was led originally, merely by accident to pursue. He performed the operation at various times, and with great success, and it was deservedly considered as one of the greatest improvements made by him in surgery. The first operation was done on 9. coachman, in St. George's Hospital, in tbe month of Decem- ber 1785 ; a broad double ligature was used, and with an eyed probe put under the vessel, it was then cut, and made two separate ones—they were tied, but with that force only as merely to bring the sides of the vessel together; two other ligatures were similarly applied on the vessel lower down, and these were tied; the ligatures were left hanging out of the wound, and union attempted by adhesion: on the fourth day, the wound was healed, except where the ligatures remained: on the ninth, a tourniquet was applied, as a considerable discharge of blood took place from the ligatures ulcerating through the artery: on the fifteenth, some of them came away, and also matter; the wound healed, and some time afterwards the remainder of the ligatures formed abscesses and were discharged, the tumour gradually became less, until it was entirely removed; he died in rather more than two years afterwards, when an opportunity was afforded of dissecting the diseased part; the femoral artery was imperforate from the arteria profunda down to the ligatures, and an ossification had taken place for nearly two inches—be- low the ligatures the vessel was open till it came to the sac, when it was again closed—the lower opening from the sac was completely obliterated. In the second case, an attempt was made to heal the wound by granulations, but this wgs not suc- cessful; hence he determined to make use of but one ligature, and unite the wound by adhesion. This practice was much 1bore preferable than the old method, for two obvious reasons, independent of its simplicity; first, the artery where the in- cision is now made, was not, or if any, very little diseased; and secondly, its easy access. A brgad ligature was at first made

LECTURE IV. 58 abscesses are attended with danger, as bones require to ex- foliate before granulation, so that from the length of time in- duced by this process, which is very tedious, patients seldom recover. TREATMENT OF ABSCESSES. When an abscess is formed accidentally, poultices and fo- mentations are all that is requisite. But in a constitution much worn down by debility, and in indolent ab.scesses, it would be proper to have recourse to stimulating remedies, in order to excite the system to action, and giving also at the same time tonics with a generous diet. In opening abscesses, the lancet is the best instrument, and is much preferable to the mode of using caustic ; but after having made an opening, should the abscess not discharge freely, then introduce a probe (the point of which being dipped in nitrous acid) into the oritice. If the abscess be very exten- sive, and opening a large surface, the best metlpd after an opening has been made, is to apply around it a roller, only taking care to leave cn openmg sufficiently large to give vent to the matter ; by this plan the sides will generally unite; It is necessary to be thoroughly acquainted with the time necessary for opening an abscess, as a great deal depends on it. There are some that require an early opening; those, namely, that are situated under the fascia or ligamentary ex- pansion and thickened cutis, the palm-of the hand and sole of the foot; and the opening made into them should be very free, as there is no risk in so doing, and prevents their unnecessary extension. Abscesses also near bones should be prematurely opened, and those that are near organs important to the functions of the animal economy, as those Under the pericranmm, in the eye, the thorax, and abdomen, and also in joints, require this plan. Hunter says, generally a collection of matter should be allowed to break of itself: but it is now considered bad practice to allow an abscess to do so, although the confinement of its con- tents can do no injury ; an opening should therefore be made when there is a conical tapering to a certain point, with evident

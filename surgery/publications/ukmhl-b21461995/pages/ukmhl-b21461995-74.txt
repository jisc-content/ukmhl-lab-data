LECTURE IV. general opinion, that the substance restored is similar to that which was lost : this is certainly true as respecting most parts of the body ; it is known very well that skin can be re-produced. . The cellullar membrane also generally acquires its original texture, though at first it is somewhat condensed. Tendons are also readily re-produced : their production seldom takes longer than a fortnight or three weeks; but there are some objections, however, to be advanced against this opinion above quoted. The muscles are not properly reproduced (and here I am aware that I differ from most writers) but it has been carefully observed the mode of union in them after a wound has been inflicted, and a complete union had taken place, was different; on examining their structure, it has always been found that the connecting substance was tendinous and not muscular. The ribs also, if their cartilages are wounded, do not unite again by their original structure, but by bone. But a gentle- man very eminent in practice, has discovered, that this is not the case as far as regards young subjects, in whom cariilage is commonly produced. Skin, newly formed, has a redder and more florid aspect than an original formed cutis; the reason is, on account of the full distension of the vessels, so that a cicatrix that is large at first, afterwards lessens, in consequence of the vessels becoming greatly diminished in their diameter. There is one circumstance to be kept in view in the forma- tion of skin :â€”a wound which is long and narrow will sooner unite than one that has a circular form; the reason here is obvious; every cicatrix is healed from the vessels of the edges, so that a long one must be united much sooner than a circular one, on account of the vessels in the latter ha^'iug a further ex- tent to pass to the centre.

43 tECTURE III. Syncope is con^dered a favorable circumstance in venesec- tion as proving that the evacuation has acted powerfully on the system. It has been the practice, and I think too very . properly, where we have evident marks of high inflammatory action prevailing, of making a large orifice in the vein ; two reasons seem to guide this determination, the one, that it will take off the determination of the blood to whatever vital organ is affected much quicker than if the orifice was small; the other, by no means an immaterial one, that the circulation becomes so sensibly affected, as to induce syncope ; the earlier it is prac- tised, and the more suddenly the evacuation, the better. There is an evident advantage in drawing blood as near as possible to the seat of inflammation : for instance, if there be high action going on in the brain, opening the temporal artery, or'jugular vein, should be had recourse to for this reason, that the impetuosity of the blood to the part is much diminished in consequence of the neighbouring vessels being considerably lessened in their diameter and the great distension taken off. The indications necessary to be observed in repeating blood- letting are, when the blood drawn is sizy, the pulse still remam- ing hard and above the natural standard ; but there is one ob- jection to the former inference, namely, in pregnant women, and also in some irritable constitutions, in whom, when blood is drawn, there is generally a siziness observable.â€”It also de- pends upon a quantity of serum in the blood evacuated: if there is a larger quantity or portion, with respect to the constituent parts, than usual, it will be improper to repeat the operatioft. A pulse from 76 to 100, with tenseness in the artery, indicates bleeding ; but from 100 to 120 not so, as it rather indicates de- bility, though in the inflammatory state of some important organs, the pulse is often in this state; and therefore to relieve any urgent symptoms, it will be proper to have recourse to blood-letting, especially when we find (which is often the case) the pulse gets much fuller after a small quantity has been drawn; but if, on the contrary, we observe the patient's pulse weakened in the pulsatory motion; a much more certain sign, however, is the blood being cupped that is drawn, and the pulse at the time, instead of being slower and fuller, becomes rather quick-

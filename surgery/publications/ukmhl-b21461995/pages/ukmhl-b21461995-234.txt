LECTURE XIX. Â£24 LECTURE XIX. ON THE STRUCTURE OF CALCULI. The different kinds of structure that the various calculi assume, ought to be well known, as well as their external appearances: this will depend, a great deal, on the mode of living, and the nature of the nucleus, &c. Calculi are com- monly laminated, connected together by means of a fesv calcu- lous fibres, not quite so much laminated as the others. In the centre is the nucleus, which is variously formed, sometimes from mucous, at other times from a coagula of blood, or from extraneous substances getting into the bladder, as needles for example, and even pieces of a bougie broken oit. Calculi are also differing in their colour from each other, not only in the whole, but also varying in their parts. Their composition is also different. The size generally extracted is from two to three ounces. The largest that I have heard of extracted weighed four ounces and a half; but there is no judging of their weight from their size, as a stone of four ounces may not be as large in bulk as one of an ounce and a half, as it depends upon the nature of the component parts. There is One, which is preserved in Trinity College, Cambridge, and was taken as far back as the reign of Charles the Second; its weight is thirty-, three ounces, three drachms, and thirty-six grains: but the largest that has ever been known, in the human subject, was in a case reported in the Philosophical Transactions for 1809, by Sir James Earle. The subject was Sir J. Ogleby, M'ho had long been labouring under symptoms of stone in the bladder: an operation was performed on him, at his particular request, by Mr. Cline; but, on account of the size of the calculus, it was found impossible to extract it whole, and an attempt was

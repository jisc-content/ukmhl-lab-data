53 JLECTURE IV. in a solution of sal ammoniac, and this effect cannot be pro- duced on any other secretion or animal fluid ; hence Hunter says, whenever globules were found floating in a fluid, that a solution of this preparation would coagulate, they were to be deemed as pus ;■ he further remarks, that pus is constituted as I have already before stated of sei uni and white globules, and is more or less healthy in proportion as the white globules predominate. The specific gravity of pus and blood are nearly similar; it must consequently be much heavier than water, in "which fluid it sinks, and occasions an uniformly troubled whitish tinge, while mucous floats and communicates to the water something in the resemblance of stringy or fibrous por- tions floating in it. Pus has a sweetish taste, which is remarkable, as well as its smell. It was supposed, till of late years, that pus was formed by the destruction of solids; but this opinion is now very generally exploded: we have several striking examples to the contrary, as in the urethra, where its membranes are rather thickened than otherwise by it; in this case formerly it was contended that the matter discharged in gonorrhoea must be caused by an ulcer in the internal passage. The lacrymal duct also, and many similar structures, such as the peritoneum, pleura, and pericardium; which are always found considerably thickened after the formation of matter. Dr. Hunter first noticed that the dissolution of parts of the body was not essential to the formation of pus : a subject died of empyema, and in the dis- section, this fact became apparent; the matter, although the quantity was very considerable, appeared to be formed from the fluids, and not the solids, no breach of continuity, or dissolution of structure could be observable. The formation of pus is from the neighbouring vessels, and wfll be proved by this experiment:—After a sufficient quantity of fluid 13 raised under the cuticle, by the application of a blister, remove the latter, make an opening in the cuticle, and apply a bit of glass to the secreted fluid, and you will find it, after remaining a short time, similar in appearance to pus, di- rectly proving that it is produced from the mouths of the vessels, and not from the solids.

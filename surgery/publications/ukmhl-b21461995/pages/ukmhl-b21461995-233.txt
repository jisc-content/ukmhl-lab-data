LECTURE XVIII. 223 should not be practicable at first, I should bleed, and emerge the patient in the tepid bath, and administer opium, &c. If, however, after the lapse of several hours, these remedies should not succeed, and no probability remaining of passing the catheter, the operation above the pubis would be advisable; but if a stricture existed, I should proceed to operate thus, which would be a material deviation from either of the three previously detailed, as it would consist in making an opening into the urethra: in fact, excepting the case of diseased pros- tate, already alluded to, I should never think of puncturing the bladder, in cases of stricture; my only object would be, to cut beyond the stricture, so as entirely to free the latter. As soon, therefore, as I should perceive the urethra to be considerably swollen and enlarged, I should direct the patient to make a violent effort to void his urine; at this very juncture, place your finger upon the perineum, and the tumour and fluctuation will be very evident, and here the incision is to commence: another similar exertion, as just stated, is to be then made, and the tumour being again distinctly felt, there will be no difficulty in proceeding with the further necessary incision, going on, as it were, mechanically. Another method, and one very easy, is to pass a staff into the urethra, as far as the stricture (for it â– will go no further), then cut down and lay it bare, then divide the stricture in the direction of the groove of the staff, carry- ing the knife towards the arch of the pubis. By these methods it is possible to relieve the stricture, which cannot otherwise happen: those arising from accidents, as in falling, are more easily cured than when caused by gonorrhoea, &c. It is at- tended with this advantage, that if it should not succeed, yet recourse may be immediately had to the trocar and canula.

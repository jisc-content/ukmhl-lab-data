LECTURE XXXni. 420 6CROPHULOUS OPHTHALMIA. This differs from the commou species of ophthalmia in be- gimiing with a small ulcer in the transparent cornea or tunica conjunctiva. The opacity that arises from ulceration will ever remain; but if it is the effect of scrophulous inflammation, it will go off. These ulcers get irritable, and cause considerable inflammation on the eye. Treatment. Aperient medicines are here requisite every fourth or sixth day. The hydrarg. muriat. given in the quantity of one-sixteenth or one-eighteenth part of a grain at a dose is eminently ser- viceable : it may be combined with a tonic; it should not be given in large doses, otherwise it will affect the mouth, which must be cautiously guarded against. The local treatment consists in an application of a solution of the argent, nitr. made weak. The black wash, with or without the tinct. opii, is used according to the degree of pain attendant upon the disease. The vin. opii, is used with similar intentions, but many consider it not so beneficial as the spirituous, and the late Mr. Saunders coincided for one in this opinion; his opportunities of using it, having been very numerous. LIPPITUDO. This means a scrophulous inflammation, taking place in the eye-lids, and most frequently attacking the upper. The secre- tion natural to the parts is changed in its nature, which glues the eye-lids together during sleep. The eye-lashes are often separated by ulceration, which attacks the edges of the eye- lids. The best remedies for these, are the ung. hydrarg. nitr. or a solution of the hydrarg. muriat. in aqua calcis. A small blister may be applied to the temples. The constitutional re- medies are the same as have been recommended generally in ecrophula. *

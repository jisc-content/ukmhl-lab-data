lECTURE IX. 106 than what surgeons in general are aware of. It has frequently been made use of to cure varices in the veins of the lower ex- tremities more particularly, and some few years ago it was put often in practice, but at the present time it is strongly repro- bated, on account of the fatal consequences which have re- sulted in a number of cases; in three or four cases which the author has in his eye, the vena saphena major was tied to effect the cure of ulcers and varices of the legs, without any mis- chievous consequences; but other cases have been witnessed, in which the patients died. It was then thought the mere division of this vessel would be sufficient, as it was very rightly conjectured, the ligature produced the bad symptoms; this was often done with success,' but two cases happened nearly at the same time, which terminated fatally. On the whole, it is strongly recommended, not to operate in either way, if it is not, in consultation, held to be advisable, as the reputa- tion of a young surgeon might be entirely blasted by an un- fortunate case of this description; and if any thing further is required to be adduced to deter its practice, it is, that there has not occurred one case where the disease was cured by the adoption of this plan of proceeding (setting the fatality of it out of the question) unless a bandage was worn constantly after- wards, and as this bandage alone will always relieve, if not entirely cure, which it does frequently, it is much better to use a roller and evaporating lotions, accompanied with a pur- gative medicine occasionally. Numberless cases yield to this mode of treatment; but even if it does not succeed, it is by no means prudent to resort to the above operation, which ought to be strongly deprecated. WOUNDS OF THE NERVES. When a nerve is divided, the effect is a destruction of the sensation, and voluntary motion in the part to which that nerve was distributed; and a partial loss of involuntary motion in that part; the power of arterial action is not destroyed, though it is most certainly weakened. Nerves, when divided, will unite again, so as to carry on the actions of the part, in a greater or less time, according to the size of the nerve. A small nerve

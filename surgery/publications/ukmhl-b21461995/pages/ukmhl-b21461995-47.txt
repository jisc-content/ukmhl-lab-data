LECTURE III. ^7 LECTURE III. INFLAMMATION CONTINUED. Inflammation is divided into two kinds, the common and the specific. ' By the first is meant that before described, as regularly pro- ducing adhesion, &c. &c. In the specific, the action of the vessels is peculiarly changed, and the effects difltVrent. In the common kind, the action is only increased. In the specific, it is changed. The common is called the healthy inflammation, being the means which nature makes use of for the restoration of lost parts. As for example, an artery is divided; here, without in- flammation, death must inevitably ensue: ligatures might be applied, but these would be thrown off and separated in from 10 to 14 days; bnt when this happens, nature makes the neces- sary provision, inflammation ensues, the internal coats of the vessel throw out or deposit coagulable lymph, and its sides be- come glued together; and the same eff'ect takes place in every part of the body. If the constitution is bad, the inflammation is slow, and it is called chronic: thus, when the coats of the eye are divided in the operation for cataract; if healthy, the wound unites in two or three days; if unhealthy, it frequently runs on for a month, or many weeks, being kept up by local and general debility, and the habit of body of the patient. Specific inflammation is of two kinds: The first arises from the peculiarity of the constitution, by the simple change of the action of vessels. E 2

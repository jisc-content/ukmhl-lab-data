LECTURE XXVII. 316 ' torn. The reduction is very easy; simple extension, and pro- per direction of the bone, when carried to a certain extent, is all that is necessary : although rest, at first, will be right, yet I decidedly object to its continuance beyond a certain period^ ttine days or a fortnight, after which gentle mbtion must be allowed, to prevent a stiffness. There is a species of dislocation of the knee joint, first de- scribed by that accurate observer, Mr. Hey, in which the semi- lunar ligaments were so long as to allow the semi-lunar carti- lages to get between the condyles; which causes the condyles to become placed rather sideways in the joint, and which has been named an oblique dislocation. The sign is, the knee bent and cannot be straightened, except the body also is bent, as the extensor muscles prevent it. The mode of treatment is, to place the patient on a high seat, and let the legs hang over; then take the leg and bend it smartly as far as you can towards the buttocks, by which means the condyles will slide over the semilunar cartilages. ANKLE. The dislocations of the ankle joint aTe,Jirst, where the tibia is thrown forwards, on the upper part of the foot. The mark is, the heel greatly lengthened, and in this accident the fibula is broken. In the reduction let one assistant take hold of the foot, and another the leg, each making extension; then the surgeon, with his hand, is to guide the tibia into its place : dur- ing the cure the patient is to lie on his heel. The second dislocation of the ankle is inwards, and the tibia is thrown on the inner side of the astragulus, together with the fibula fractured just above its base; also that part of the tibia which is attached to the fibula at its lower part, is broken. The mode of reduction will be the same as in the former caseâ€”by extension of two people and directing the bone. The leg must rest, during the cure, on the malleolus internus on the bed, which must be the resting part of the foot.

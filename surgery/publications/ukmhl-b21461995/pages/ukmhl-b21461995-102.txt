When wounds of this description are produced by any sharp pointed instrument, the elfects resulting from them are three-fold : they excite inflammation of the absorbent vessels, they may wound the fascia, and they may destroy life by in- ducing tetanus. With respect to the 1st species, namely, that by which inflammation of the absorbent vessels is excited. The symptoms attendant upon a wound of this kind are as follows j red lines are extending from the wound to the next absorbent gland in the course of these vessels; on feeling them Ihey are found to be hard and knotted where the valves are placed. The contiguous glands are enlarged; sometimes matter is formed in the vessels or glands, oftener occurring in the latter; and this also more frequently happens in wouncls of the leg and foot than in those incident to the arm, on account of the vessels being larger in the part, and the circulation in the blood vessels more languid. When suppuration takes place in the absorbents, from the inflammation consequent upon a punctured wound, the consti- tutional affection and irritation runs extremely high. These wounds are accidents frequently affecting medical men, who are in the habit of opening or dissecting bodies.

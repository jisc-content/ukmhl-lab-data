LECTURE IV. 52 of urine would be the immediate result of it in the urethra, of which I recollect Mr. Astlcy Cooper relate a very singular in- stance, in an animal called the Kangaroo, which died very quickly after its first attack, and being a favourite with its mas- ter, he wished very much to be informed of the cause of its suddeu death, and it was brought for Mr. Cooper's dissection, Avho, after having attentively examined the parts, discovered that an adhesive inflammation had occurred to some extent in the urethra, so as to plug up the canal entirely, and the con- sequence of course was, reteution of urine, succeeded by speedy death. In croup, lymph is produced instead of pus; and fistula lacrymalis is a consequence of an obstruction in the ductus ad nasum. If we are asked why mucous surfaces poured out pus, and vaporous surfaces, coagulable lymph, it may be answered, that the extreme vessels in exhalent surfaces are minuter, and will not readily admit pus through them, although they allow of coagulable lymph ; in mucous surfaces, the vessels are larger, and pus readily finds its way. When suppurative inflammation takes place in a wound, it is always preceded by the adhesive process, which being pre- vented from taking place, suppuration must ensue. Granu- lation is a mode of union where the adhesive process fails, for instance, if a part is wounded by any sharp instrument, and lymph is not thrown out sufficiently for the union of parts, then suppuration coihmences, and the wound is healed by granu- lations. OF THE NATURE OF MATTER AND ITS MODE OF FORMATION. 1 shall first commence with the formation of matter: if w* attentively examine the nature of pus, we shall find it com- posed of serum and white particles similar in form to the red globules of the blood; the usual mode of discovering the difference between pus and mucous is by art, and it has been found that pus cannot be coagulated by the gastric juice, and this was attempted from its being thought to have some simi- larity to milk; the fluid part of pus can be made to coagulate

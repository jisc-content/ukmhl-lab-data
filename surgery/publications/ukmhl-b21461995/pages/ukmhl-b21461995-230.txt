LECTURE XVlll. 220 it: a very material one is, that the urine distilling through the canula, (or when this is withdrawn, which must be done,) it passes in contact with the rectum, and produces a considerable degree of irritation and thickening of its internal coat; besides there is a constant inclination of voiding the fasces, together with an extreme tenderness of the gut. With respect to the danger of wounding the vesiculcB seminales, or the vasae defe- rentiae, this will be avoided by passing the instrument at least an inch and an half up the rectum, as they would most certainly be injured if it was not carried sufficiently high up. The second operation is that above the pubis: when there- fore a surgeon is called in to a patient labouring under retention of urine, and having a considerable degree of swelling and fluc- tuation perceptible above the os pubis, he would not hesitate about puncturing the bladder if every other means previously resorted to had quite failed: the manner of this operation I shall now detail. When the bladder is empty and in a relaxed state, then the peritoneum is reflected in such a manner as to be in contact with the rectus muscle, and consequently in the direction of the pubis; but when distended, the reflection is at some distance from the latter, and not liable to be wounded by the trocar: first feel for the symphisis pubis, then make an in- cision with a lance or scalpel through the integuments, about an inch in length, in the direction of the linea alba, immediately above the symphisis, then with a straight trocar and canula, (both rather short) although many prefer a curved one, pass it so as to correspond with the axis of the bladder into this viscus, that is, obliquely downwards and backwards; be careful of the direction, as the trocar might otherwise pass between the blad- der and pubis. This simple operation has been objected to by experienced practitioners for two reasons; first, because an ulceration of the bladder takes place in consequence of the canula being left in ; and the second is that the urine is liable to be extravasated into the cellular membrane, between the ab- dominal muscles and bladder: both of these objections may be easily refuted. To counteract the first, an elastic gum ca- theter might be introduced, which will answer as well as the canula, and from the use of which no inconvenience will anse.

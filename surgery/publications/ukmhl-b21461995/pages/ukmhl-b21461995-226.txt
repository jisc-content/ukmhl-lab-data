LECTURE XVHÂ» ON THE HARE-LIP. Hare-lip takes its name from its resemblance to the fifsure in a hare's lip: it most commonly occurs in children, being born with this malformation in one or both lips. The fissure mostly happens in the upper lip, and often extends back to the roof of the mouth, and to the soft palate : it is sometimes double, (i. e.) taking place on each side the lip, a portion of the latter remaining between the fissures ; occasionally the space intervening is considerable, but mostly they are not far apart; whenever it occurs it occasions very great deformity, andean only be remediable by an operation. The time proper, and most likely for the operation to be attended with success, is after the age of two years ; prior to this it is conceived, that there is a great risk of the child's loos- ing its life: in fact, many instances have been witnessed when children have been carried off by convulsions at an earlier age, which ought to put the surgeon on his guard. The operation, it must be admitted, has certainly been performed in children very young, and with complete success; but as it has proved fatal in several cases, I conceive it will be suflacient to defer attempting it at an earlier period than I have above stated, as it is nearly certain of being attended with a cure of the malforma- tion when children have attained two years of age, their system at that period being more capable of resisting ^ny constitu- tional irritation that may be excited. Mode of operating. The chief object the surgeon has in view, is to form an acute angle, in removing the edges of the fissure by two smooth and even incisions meeting at a point at the upper part, so as to produce an entire new surface on each side in such a manner, that when closed together the whole can be approximated neatly without an intervening space; and with this view pass a double edged cataract knife through the upper part of the lip, continuing the incisiou down to the bottom, parallel to the fis- sure on one side; then the knife must be carried in the same manner on the other side: make two interrupted sutures; the

LECTURE XXXIII. fected side, though this is not always attendant: on examin- ing the knee, no appearance of disease is present, and this being the case, he is immediately led to suspect that the affection is situated in the hip, and a surgeon knowing this, who hears a patient complain of considerable pain towards the knee, will be suspicious of the real cause. The mode of ascertaining the disease is this; desire the patient to raise his knees alter- nately to the abdomen, that limb w^hich is atfected will not be completely elevated as the other, and its elevation will be at- tended with some degree of pain : the patient should then ro- tate his hmb, outward or inwards, which on the diseased side he will not be able to do : then placing the patient on his feet, a line should be extended from the cleft in the nates to the spine of the ilium ; this being done, it will be found, that the distance is much greater on the diseased side, than it is on the other: the nates also, on this side, are more prominent to the eye : the leg also, on that side, is much larger; this is in some measure the case, in consequence of etfusion into the cavity of the joint, but much of this appearance will depend upon the situation of the body when examined. After the disease has been present some time the affected limb will be found shorter than the other, arising in consequence of the absorption of the Acetabulum and head of the OS femoris : this action of the absorbents will sometimes go on until an opening is formed between the cavities of the acetabulum and the pelvis. Cases have occurred where three abscesses have made their way and discharged themselves throujih the vagina, and yet the patient has recovered. This has also happened when they have burst into the rectum: but in the only instance I recollect detailed, the patient died. The Treatment That is required, in this disease, is the application, of a perpetual blister, or an issue ; but 1 should prefer the latter. The hip- bath, or a large bladder filled with hot-water, and applied to the adjacent parts for a considerable length of time, will afford tem- porary relief, at the same time pursuing the mode of cure by medicines as before noticed.

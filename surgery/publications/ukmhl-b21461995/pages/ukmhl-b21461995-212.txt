LECTURE XVI. 202 who ventured to adopt a plan for its removal, was Cheseldeii, one of the surgeons formerly at St. Thomas's Hospital—he did this with a couching needle, having a sharp cutting edge on the one side only—he introduced it through the sclerotica, at a very little distance from the cornea, into the interior of the eye, and which he made to enter the iris at the outer angle; he then forced gradually the point of the instrument through the anterior chamber of the aqueous humour to the other extre- mity of the iris nearest the nose, he turned the edge of the needle backwards, and in withdrawing it, made a transverse section of the iris—it appears, that the contractile powers of this membrane, made the opening, which was but small, con- siderably larger, and the operation was eminently successful. Professor Scarpa, in his valuable work, recommends a straight- slender couching needle to be introduced through the sclero- tica, at the outer or external edge, at the distance of two lines from the cornea, and then to be pushed to the upper and inner edge of the iris—it is made to perforate the inner edge of this membrane at its upper part, and a portion of the edge of the membrane is to be detached by its means from the ciliary liga- ments by repeated exertions, till a considerable aperture is made, and this detached membrane is then to be left in the aqueous humour to be finally absorbed: at the conclusion he seems to think it might be done more effectually with a curved needle. Other authors have written on this subject, from which it would appear, that whatever method tends most to facilitate and simplify the detaching a circular portion of the iris, would be the most preferable; I have detailed briefly these two, in order to shew the intention to be kept in view. Some surgeons are unfavourable to the formation of artificial pupils, but I think success in some few cases would fully warrant such attempts. ON COUCHING. By couching, is understood a depression of the crystalline lens, either to one side or to the bottom of the eye, removing jt from its axis. The operation is not only very easy but

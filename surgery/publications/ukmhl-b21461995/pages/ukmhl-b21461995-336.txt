The lacunas are soon affected, and an obstruction takes place in them, and it frequently happens that an abscess forms, which bursting, the contents are discharged per urethra : it generally happens near the fraenum, but there are instances where they form near the bulb, and in this situation they are dangerous, in consequence of the probability of the contents being effused into the cellu- lar membrane. When the inflammation extends along the ure- thra, opposite to the acceleratores urinae, spasmodic contractions here' occur every four or live minutes, extending to the peri- neum, and often accompanied with an inflammatory stricture m t^e urethra, which is easily known by the flow of urine being often suddenly impeded. When the inflammation extends as far as the membranous part of the urethra, those ducts which open into the latter, take on the disease, as the vasse deferentiae, and which, extending along their course to the testicle, produce hernia humoralis, prior to which, however, there is considerable pain felt in perineo.

In every stage the bowels must be kept open by mild laxatives; and if the patient is of a full plethoric

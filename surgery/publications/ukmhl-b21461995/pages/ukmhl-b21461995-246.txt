It is from other disadvantages that the knife has obtained the preference, and vvhich, as far as I have been able to learn, has been at- tended with great success, the fatal cases being but one in twenty. The greatest superiority it possesses over the gorget, is that it is by no means so liable to slip between the bladder and rectum; a circumstance which would be fatal to a pro- fessional character. The knife I last saw Mr. Cooper use, was exactly similar to a probe-pointed bistoury, with this dif- ference, that there is a beak at its end, and in using it, it should be passed along the groove in the staff into the bladder, and then make the cut as it is drawn out again, so as to allow of the stone being extracted. New Method of operating- Having properly secured the patient, as already described, on a table of convenient height, the surgeon seated, and the stafiF intro- duced, which mustincline a little to the left side, so as to rest upon the stone; it must be kept in this position by means of an assist- ant : feel for the symphysis pubis, and make the incision an inch below, and opposite the arch of the pubis; and as it would be per- fectly unnecessary, it should not be too near the scrotum, but rather on the left side of the raphe, as inflammation would most likely take place, which would terminate in mortification and sloughing of the parts: the incision is to terminate in a Ime near the middle of the anus, between it and the tuberosity of the ischium, having been carried in an oblique direction down- wards and outwards; this exposes the bulb of the penis, w^hich is covered by the accelerator urinae muscle. The next incision will be through that muscle, when the bulb will lie bare; con- tinue it a little below, and on one side of the bulb, or rather betwixt the bulb and the crus penis—then with one finger of your left hand, press the bulb towards the right side of the pa- tient—then divide the transversalis perinei, the transversalis alter, and also the artery which goes to supply the bulb, which

LECTURE III. 45 alluded to, bleeding and purging, and when this happens it is always considered as a favorable circumstance : but when the means are not attained by these methods, we must have recourw to others; and the hot balh is often attended with considerable benefit, and there are other remedies to be given accordmg to circumstances, such as large quantities of diluent drinks, blad- ders of warm water applied to the extremities, and lastly anti- monials ; they relieve the oppressive dryness of the skin, and tend to lessen the increased action of the affected part; opium is seldom used.

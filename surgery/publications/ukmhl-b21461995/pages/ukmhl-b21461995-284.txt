274 LECTUIIE XXIII* that is required is to carry a string round the pelvis, just above the abdominal ring. Trusses are made of an elastic substance, generally of steel, so constructed as to keep up constant pres- sure, sufficient to resist the action of the muscles, and so formed as to allow of the patient's going about his business as usual. In applying a truss be careful to let the pad rest midway be- tween the spine of the ilium and cross of the pelvis over the iliac artery, so as to reach as far as the abdominal ring, and not directly upon it, as is usually done. The truss maker should be instructed to make the neck of the truss short. In case the hernia is very large, the pad is to be placed at right angles, so as to have a perpendicular bearing from the ring upwards. The reasou of this is, that owing to the size of the hernia both rings, that is, the internal aperture and external, are brought nearly into a straight line. There is one very material objection to Salmon's patent truss, which is, that the patient cannot wear it at night, which is absolutely necessary to attain a cure. To effect a cure, a truss must be worn several years: from pressure an obliteration of the mouth of the sac happens, and hydrocele sometimes occurs afterwards, which may be treated in the usual manner. A well constructed truss, properly applied, so as to keep up an uniform pressure for a long continuance, will cause the internal part of the sac to be thrown into folds, in conse- quence of the contraction of the cremaster muscle, which is oc- casioned by the pressure, so that ultimately a thickening of the membrane is produced, which occasionally is found to be com- pletely united, so as to effect a permanent cure.

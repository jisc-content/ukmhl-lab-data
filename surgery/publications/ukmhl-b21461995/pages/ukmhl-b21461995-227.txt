Two silver pins, with steel points, used formerly to be had recourse to, passed nearly through the edges of the wound, and a thread carried around them in the form of a figure of eight; but from their producing generally a considerable degree of irritation, they are now very commonly laid by. If dunng the operation any considerable haemorrhage (for there will always be some) arises, it will be right to carry the needle and ligature near the bleeding vessel; this will be much better than apply- ing a ligature around the vessel, for if it is done, the conse- quence will be that the union will be incomplete ; the bleeding almost invariably ceases when the edges of the wound are ac- curately brought into contact. If the hare-lip is double, (i. e.) if there are two fissures present, the operation is to be per- formed in the above manner, only in this respect, that it is only to be done on one side at first, and not to proceed to any fur- ther operation till that fissure is quite healed, when the same operation might be performed on the one remaining. A por- tion of the jaw occasionally projects between the fissures, and sometimes a tooth; when this latter happens, and it presses on the jaw, it may be removed; even the removal of a piece of the jaw is now and then necessary. The period at which the ligatures are to be taken away, will be from the fourth to the fifth day in adults, and in children, from the fifth to the sixth; but this must depend upon circum- stances, for if it is perceived the process of ulceration is com- mencing, it will be right to take them away on the fifth day, and if at that time the lip has yielded at all, it will be right to apply a narrow and long slip of adhesive plaster across it to the cheeks, so as to allow a relaxation during the crying of the child.

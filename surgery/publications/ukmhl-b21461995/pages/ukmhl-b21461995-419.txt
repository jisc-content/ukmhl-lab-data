LECTURE XXXIII. 40D limes for months, in cue stage; and wlien it has arrived ^t the suppurative, it still evinces the sa.me degree of languor as whejui it attacks the glands : when ulcerations ens|ue, tlie wounds are uncommonly slow and tedious in healing. Si/mptoms.—Scrophulous enlargement of a joint is seldom attended wuh much pain at the commencement; the patient complajus of a sense of stiffness in the joint, and on minute examination at the affected part, the limb will be found shorter^ sometimes, however, it will be found even longer than its fellow. Occasionally, the limb will be in a slight degree pain- ful, coming on at intervals; yet this sym,ptom is by no means a regular attendant upon the disease, and mostly occurs in thos^e persons who are of an irritable disposition, and most commonly in affections of the hip-joint. In this state of stiffness a,nd enlargement with pain at intervals, the disease continues fqr years, the patient suffering very little either locally or consti- tutionally, further than what 1 have described; then, sud- denly, and most frequently in the spring season, the disease takes on a more active state, the pain becomes violent, the size of the limb much increased, and a ge.neral sympathizing pain and uneasiness pervades the w|iole frame, so as to affect the constitution; ihe rest is disturbed, and the appetite and strength decrease. From these symptoms existing, a person would be led to imagine that matter will be discharged almost imme- diately ; but this is rarely the case, as the joint will frequently lessen very much, and many weeks will elapse previous ,to ^he matter making an outlet, and then tvvo or three inches from the seat of the disease, having insinuated itself between the muscles and integuments. Not unfrequently a fluctuation is perceptible to the toucji, resembling an increased secretion of synovial fluid; ^t length hiflamjpation again ensues, and ulceration commences. If the opening did not take place ;at some distance from the cavity of the joint, it must necessarily follow that life would be but short, unless amputation was ha,d recourse to : this being the case,,the.infl,[}mn)ation.set t}p in the joint is but partial. When the,n)atter has been evacuated,.it mostly occurs that the urgent symptoms will abate, and the patiept,remain in tjje„^aJl;^,e .stute for years, t^^.e i^^cers cpn-

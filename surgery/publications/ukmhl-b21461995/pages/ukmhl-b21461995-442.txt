OBSERVATIONS. The author, or rather compiler, has now concluded the diffi- cult and arduous task he undertook : and begs leave to return to those Gentlemen who have patronized this humble effort, his sincere thanks: assuring them, that as he has acted with the utmost liberality, he trusts he shall experience every indul- gence by the junior members of the profession, as -several cir- cumstances have occurred to render this work less perfect than it otherwise would have been; particularly the death of his best and dearest friend anfe relative. Many have, from the most dishonourable motives, circulated, that this series were merely copies of Lectures on Surgery, now given in town; but he assures his friends most solemnly, that it is eight years and upwards, since he attended or heard a lecture on this branch of the profession, delivered in London; and he has, during the compilation, abstained from doing so, that it might not be said, any ideas contained herein, were acquired in such a manner. Neither has he availed himself of the loan of nu- merous manuscript lectures offered him to assist in this under- taking. THE END.

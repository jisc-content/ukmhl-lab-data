I 296 LECTURE XXVT. LECTURE XXVI. ON FEMORAL HERNIA. It is necessary that the anatomical structure of the parts concerned in this species should be well known, and this some anatomists have considered somewhat difficult to make intelli- gible and understood. From Poupart's ligament two portions of fascia pass upwards, the fascia transversalis and iliaca ; and one downwards, the fas- cia lata, which is given oflf from the greater part of the liga- ment, and covers the thigh. The inner part of this fascia forms a thin edge, which Mr. Hey has called the femoral ligament, and which he wrongfully supposes (according to Mr. Astley Cooper) to be the cause of stricture. Another portion of fascia coming from the pubis, unites a short distance downwards from Poupart's ligament with the inner edge of the fascia lata, under the vena saphena major, and thus a space or opening is left between the junction of the two portions and Poupart's ligament, which is named the falsitorra, orlunated edge of the fascia lata: through this opemng the vein issues forthâ€”the absorbent vessels also pass here, and ter- minate in the groin; and it is through iUs opening that the femoral hernia descends and becomes situated over, not under the fascia lata. In cutting through the fascia lata, half an mch below the falsiform process, a second portion of fascia will be found to be eiven off from the back part of Poupart's ligament, which forms the sheath of the femoral vessels; and it is into this sheath that the hernia descends. The anterior crural nerve forms the boundary of the sheath on the outer side, and the

269 LECTURE XXIII. in this fascia is an aperture or opening, situated midway be- tween the spine of the ilium and cross of the pubis, which is easily discovered by the little resistance opposed to the fingers, and this aperture is the internal abdominal ring through which the spermatic chord is observed to emerge from the abdomen, passing in an oblique course, in a kind of canal, under the edge of the internal oblique and transversalis, and the obliquity is downwards and forwards, from one inch and a half to two inches previous to its arrival at the external opening. The second fascia, is the fascia iliaca, which passes over the muscles of that name: this shuts up the space underneath Poupart's ligament, which the fascia transversalis prevents the viscera from getting underneath the transversalis muscle. The portion it sends downwards is the fascia lata of the thigh, the inner part of which comes from the pubis: a part of this fas- cia is derived from the gluteus maximus muscle : there is a passage for the femoral vessels under Poupart's ligament or crural arch, the interstices of which are filled up with fatty sub- stance, and lymphatic glands : this, and the external abdominal ring, are the only two natural openings through which the femoral and inguinal hernia protrudes : this will be more ac- curately described when I shall treat of femoral hernia. The lower portion of the obliquus ascendens internus passes through the abdominal ring with the spermatic vessels, and then forms the cremaster muscle. In the description of hernia, it is requisite to understand per- fectly the nature of the hernial sac. In hernia there is a smooth polished membrane in which the protruded parts are contained; this is denominated the sac, and is nothing more than an elon- gation of the peritoneum. In some parts of the cavity of the abdomen this membrane is more loosely attached than in others, and this is perceived to be the case at the lower part of the abdomen. It was, a few years ago, thought impossible for the peritoneum to admit of such a degree of distention as to surround tumours containing such large portions of the vis- cera as are sometimes pushed out; but it is now found that the peritoneum has the power of extension to a very great extent,

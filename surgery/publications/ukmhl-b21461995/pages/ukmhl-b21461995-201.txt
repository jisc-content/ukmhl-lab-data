LECTURE XV. igi tached to the artery, a blunt iron probe was used to convey a double ligature under the artery; the lower one was first se- cured, the artery was then detached about an inch in length, and the upper ligature applied: in the unsuccessful case the artery was left undivided, in the successful one it was cut dirough, mid-way between the two ligatures: the wound is to be closed with adhesive plaster. An opinion formerly prevailed, that the tyeing of the carotid artery was always succeeded by stupor, sleepiness, &c.; but this requires very'little to refute it, as the fallacy of such opi- nions has been demonstrated. When both carotids are tied, the circulation must be carried on by means of the superior and inferior thyroideal and vertebral arteries: I have never heard this attempted on the human subject. In operating for aneurism on the scal'p, supposing it to be in the posterior aural artery, it is generally necessary to tie the artery, passing into the sac, as well as that leading out of it, oil account of the free anastomosis. Sectjring the Subclavian AbTery.â€”In a true aneu- rism of the axillary artery, that is, a very well marked one, wherein the clavicle is much elevated, the operation is very difficult; but under the common circunistances of aneurism, where the clavicle is in its situation, it is by no means so : it here ' becomes necessary to tie the subclavian artery, and to do so, an incision is to be made, beginning about an inch and a half from the sternal end, and continue it to the same distance from the scapular end of the clavicle, so as to make the middle of this bone the centre of your incision : the internal jugular vein will be discovered in the middle of this cut, and underneath, the axillary plexiiS of nerves, lying above the artery, which will be found emerging from the chest, between the scaleni niuscles. There is considerable difficulty in the passage of a ligature under the artery, and in separating it from the nerves; and many very ingenious instruments have been invented for this purpose ; a curved eye-probe probably may do as well as any. Great care must be taken to avoid including any of the cervical nerves; and if the operation is done on the left side,

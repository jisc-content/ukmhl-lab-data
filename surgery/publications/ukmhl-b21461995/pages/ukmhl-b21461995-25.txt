INTEODirCTORY LECTURE. 15 not only to attend the surgeons in their regular visit, but visit the hospitals themselves, and make notes of those cases that appear most interesting, as well as the treatment successfully adopted : this will be found very instructive and beneficial. Although it has been already stated that anatomy and the economy of the human body may be learnt in the dissecting room, yet the knowledge of diseases, their morbid actions and sympathies, can only be learned by the bed-side, by actual obser- vation ; and this is not sufficiently attended to—it may be illus- trated in the following manner, where a medical man will prove detrimental, rather than serviceable, to his patient and his pro- fession :—A man shall have a strangury for two days, during which he has not been able to pass any urine; at the end of this time the pain and distressing symptoms go off, and the patient shall be apparently relieved. The practitioner supposes the inflammation has subsided, and he prescribes those medi- cines which he conceives are necessary subsequent to the irri- tation : the consequence is, that in 24 hours the man dies. ' Now, the surgeon who was acquainted with the action of the muscular coat of the bladder, would know the reason the urgent symptoms had ceased; that it was owing to the con- tinued distention of the bladder, producing paralysis ; he would, therefore, draw off the collected fluid, and if he found, on introducing the catheter, no urine was evacuated, he would make an artificial action, by pressing the abdomen on the blad- der, and, by these means, very little apprehension would be held of his present safety and consequent recovery. Again, Should a patient apply to a surgeon with fistula in perineo, which had been opened, and, through the continual interference of some practitioner or other, could not be healed. Should he say it came of itself, or from a hurt, his story would not be believed, however plausible ; but it would be known it must b^ occasioned by a connexion w ith the urethra, and that the dis- charge of urine through the sinus kept the fistula from healing. It is knowledge of this nature that will enable us to practise with success; for, if we are not thus conversant with the causes of morbid actions, it is impossible we can render that assist- ance we ought to those objects whom it may be in our power

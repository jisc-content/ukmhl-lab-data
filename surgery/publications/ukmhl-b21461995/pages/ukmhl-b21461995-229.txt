There are three ways proposed to puncture the bladder to relieve the patient by means of an operation in cases of re- tention of urine—thej^r*^ that I shall describe, is that per rectum. When the bladder is excessively distended, by an examination, per anum, it will be found protruding downwards, and occupying the proper situation of the rectum at its ex- tremity, and is immediately felt on the introduction of the finger. The tumour is very tender, and a fluctuation always perceptible, so that there can seldom be a doubt with respect to the nature of the case. As soon as the bladder is found projecting on the rectum, a surgeon, void of anatomical know- ledge, would not hesitate to puncture it. The peritoneum is reflected in that manner as to give ample space for allowing the bladder to be opened, so as to be in no danger of wounding the above membrane. The vasae deferentise leave an opening of a triangular form behind the prostate, in the centre of which the trocar is to be introduced. The operation is a very simple one, and may be thus performed : having a trocar of consider- able length, about four inches, and a canula three, and some- what curved (although a straight one will answer the purpose) it is to be carried up to the posterior part of the bladder, having previously passed the fore finger of the left hand into the anus to serve as a director, then lowering the handle, and elevating the point through the axis of the pelvis, as if it was intended to come out at the abdominal muscles, it enters the bladder, the trocar is then to be withdrawn, and the urine evacuated through the canula. This necessary operation would always be had recourse to, if it were not for the inconveniences resulting from

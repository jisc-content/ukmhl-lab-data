* LECTURE XXXIII. 419 fortnight: this depends upon the quantity that was at first dis- charged. Thus, if a pound and a half is discharged on the first opening, it must be repeated when half a pound is collected in the cyst, and so on, diminishing the proportion, or rather col- lection gradually. The whole contents of the abscess should never be discharged at one time, but in proportion to its size and quantity contained, will be the rule to evacuate it, and the discretion of the surgeon must decide how much will be ad- visable to take off each time. Sometimes the matter will be collected in a much shorter time than at others : the discharge still proceeds from the loins, and the surgeon is not to be dis- couraged if this continues for years, as it has often proved the case. A very striking case may now be seen of the con- tinuance of this disease in the daughter of the assistant to that truly respectable and scientific surgeon, Mr. Francis, of Bexley. As the discharge is nothing more than an effect of a diseased action set up, it is necessary that the complaint in the spine should be equally attended to as if there was no discharge ; and if the practitioner does not succeed in preventing the discharge from continuing a great length of time, yet he might be able to prolong life to a great extent, when compared with the rapid fate of those who are allowed to have the abscesses trusted to nature alone. The opening made in the abscess should never be made large, and the skin should be drawn aside previous to punc- turing the cellular membrane or substance interposed, after having penetrated the skin. Pieces of bones have been seen to exfoliate from the spine in this disease, and then the patients have done well: probably these portions of bone retarded the cure, by keeping up the flow of matter. The Treatment Of Lumbar Abscesses will be exactly the same as Psoas in every respect. Constitutional remedies should be administered in both cases.

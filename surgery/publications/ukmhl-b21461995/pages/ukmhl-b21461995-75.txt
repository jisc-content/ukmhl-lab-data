LECTURB V. 65 LECTURE V. ON ULCERS. An ulcer is a granulated surface secreting pus : when healthj/ the granulations have a florid appearance, and the skin forming the edge of the sore is approximating to the surface of the sore : here granulations are no impediment to its restoration. Every wound must become an ulcer, which does not unite by adhesion. Healthy ulcers secrete pus which is white and thick, and not adhering to the smface. The only treatment required is, first to apply lint to the surface, which will come off after a few days, and when removed, granulations will be discovered under it, and a quantity of pus will be also secreted at the same time, and deposited on the surface of the sore. Poultices must then be applied, as they materially assist the rising of the gra- nulations by their gentle stimulus, and are of greatei" utility than simple dressings- of any ointment. In a few days more they rise as high as the edges of the skin ; then lint must be applied, and some unctuous substance on the edges, the simpler the better, as that composed only of wax and oil; but be careful the lint does not touch the edges, as it would greatly impede the healing of the parts, by preventing the shooting of granulations to the skin. A formation of a scab from the evaporation going on, on the surface, will be best pre- vented by the poultice. This is the treatment required when an ulcer is in an healthy state. IMPEDIMENTS TO THE HEALING PROCESS. Mr. Home on the healthy ulcer, tells us, that some super- ficial ones will not be so disposed to heal when kept moist and unexposed to the atmosphere, as when they become dry and

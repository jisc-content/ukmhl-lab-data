LECTURE XX* 242 LECTURE XX. ON DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE. There are four diseases which the testes are liable to, and which require the operation for their removal. The jirst is of the hydatid kind, where cysts are formed in the substance of the testes ; it mostly occurs to people from the age of thirty or forty to forty-five, seldom exceeding that period. An en- largement first takes place in the external part of the epididi- mis—the continuation of it is downwards : its progress is slow and gradual, and at last affects the whole substance of the tes- ticle, and then extends to the vas deferens; but never, as far as I can ascertain, so as to disease the spermatic chord, which is free from it, its vessels being only a little enlarged, and conse- quently it does not extend to the abdomen. This disease is unlike all others to which the testes are liable, and the patient is not subject to any future danger after an operation from extension. On examining the scrotum after the removal of the testis, the veins are observed to be in a varicous state, distinguishing it from the affections of the testis ; and on cutting through the scrotum, the veins of the tunica vaginalis will be found to ex- ceed in size those of the former. The scrotum is not at all inflamed, having no redness or blush on its surface: there is a greater determination of blood to the testis than in an healthy state, and therefore the chance of haemorrhage, after an ope- ration, is greater than in other diseased testes. A fluctuation is always perceptible—and this, with many other similar symp- toms, may lead, without cause, to the supposition, that the dis- ease is hydrocele: but the distinguishing marks are theSe—m an hydatid testicle, the fluctuation is confined to one part on

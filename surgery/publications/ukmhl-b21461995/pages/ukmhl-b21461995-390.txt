S80 liECTUEE XXXI. easily discriminated from any other, though it is in general con- sidered as difficult to distinguish it, in all its various forms. This idea has arisen from persons supposing that many other parts, besides those enumerated before, are liable to the dis- ease, which opinion is erroneous: as some parts of the body only can be attacked with infection, so some persons appear to be more susceptible than others. A person who has been much in the habit of cohabiting with infected women, will sometimes not imbibe the complaint, though the females may have several chancres at the time ; and yet if another person does the saine, he will immediately contract the disease. A person of very debauched habits, will occasionally be found, to whom it is scarcely possible to give the disorder, though he exposes himself to every variety of it, and has coimexion with the most impure females. The disposition to gonorrhoea and syphilis appear to be less according to the frequency of the person's being attacked with these complaints. A person who has had two or three attacks of gonorrhoea, will have connexion with a woman who is unwell without her communicating the disease to him, while if one comes to her immediately after who has not expeiienced the complaint, he will carry it away with him. A surgeon ought carefully to distinguish between gleet and gonorrhoea, for a person slightly affected with the former, on having con- nexion will find the discharge often increased, which he will conceive to be gonorrhoea, but which in reality is merely a greater flow of matter, in consequence of the irritation and in- flammation attendant on erection, and which matter is per- fectly incapable of communicating any infectious disease. The venereal disease has been considered by Mr. Hunter as merely a local complaint, unattended with any constitutional fever or aff"ection; but many of the surgeons since his decease pilfer with him decidedly in this respect; for the secondary symptoms are always accompanied with constitutional irritation and fever, which is evinced by the exacerbation coming on m the evening ; the degree of fever comes on towards five or six o'clock in the evening, and abates about the same hour m the morning; and the remainder of the day the patient remains in

LECTURE XV. 185 the taking away blood will be beneficial; if not so, at all events it will be right to open his bowels with some brisk purgative. Place the patient in an horizontal position, on a table three feet high, his legs are to be kept in a relaxed state, that is, his knees bent, and his heels brought towards the other leg, so as to form an angle with the body, the reason for this position is obvious ; if the limb was extended, the sartorius muscle would com- pletely exclude the possibility of easily getting at the artery; the surgeon is to be seated on the left side to his patient in an elevated chair—there are four incisions necessary : the first is to be made on the anterior and inner part of the thigh, begin- ning one-third downwards from the spinous process of tha ilium to the knee, and continuing it in the direction of the femoral artery four inches in length, which would completely expose the inner edge of the sartorius muscle. The surgeon is then to press his finger into the opening, and cutting along the edge of the muscle, to draw it outwards, which will then expose the fascial sheath, enveloping the femoral artery vein and branch of the crural nerve. The next incision is to be carefully made about an inch in length, through this sheath, •whicli covers the femoral vessels. The exact anatomical de- rivation of this fascia, as originally made manifest by Mr. Astley Cooper, will be explained when treating on femoral hernia. The artery will be found exterior to the vein, and a septum between them, which must be separated—the vein is on the inside, the artery in the middle, and the nerve to the out- side of the artery. It will, in this stage, be proper to lay aside the scalpel for the present, and take a director, which must be moved gently from side to side till it is easily insinuated under the artery ; then withdrawing it, pass a flattened probe under the vessel with two ligatures, secure the uppermost immediately, then separate the artery below from the cellular membrane, connecting it to the sheath, in order to secure the second ligature, about one inch asunder from the uppermost; the ar- tery, thus secured, is to be lifted up, and divided midway be- tween the two ligatures with a probe pointed bistoury; as soon as this is done, the parts are to be brought together by means of adhesive plaster; care should of course be taken by my

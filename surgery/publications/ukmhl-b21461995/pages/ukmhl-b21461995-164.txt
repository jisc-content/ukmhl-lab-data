LECTURE Xlir, 154 an increased motion of the pulse, comes on immediately. Vomiting, in this afftction, is generally a striking and attendant symptom: his menial powers are considerably diminished, but commonly are retained in a small degree. His natural wants, or calls of nature, will cause him to those desires, as if they were implanted in him by instmct; he will get out of his bed, void his urine, but when got into bed again, all that can be done to rouse him, and make him sensible of any thing, will be ineffectual and vain. A striking instance of this 1 heard men- • tibned, in a gentlemdn who had unfortunately met with this injury; no answer could be got to any questions put to him at his bed-side, but it was observed, after the attendants had left the room (having narrowly watched for that purpose), that be got out of bed to pass his urine, after which he again laid down, and immediately on approaching his bed-side, not an answer in any shape whatever could be obtained: this proves, evidently, that they attend to the calls of nature merely from habit, which is so strongly fixed in them, as not at all to be done away with, though all other motion and sense seems to be quite obliterated. If the concussion should not have been violent, yet sufficient to stun the person, accompanied by giddi- ness, noise in the ears, loss of memory, and stupefaction, and these symptoms go off, it may be concluded, that no very jserious injury has happened to the brain, further than the im-- mediate shock: the patient should be requested to live abste- miously for some time, and by no means to indulge in any diet that would be likely to hurry the circulation, as inflammation will be very apt to follow. The patient is to be bled, and purgative medicines administered—every trace of the symptoms will, in all probability, go off in five or six days, but if they continue beyond that period, it may be concluded, inflamma- tion has taken place, and the necessary measures decidedly pursued; and when inflammation is thus complicated, the na- ture of the injury is more obscure. No patient is safe from the eff^ects of concussion, till fourteen days after the accident. Mr. David Watkins, a farmer, met with this injury in return- ing from market, and he was intoxicated at the time; I con- cluded; at first, the symptoms were merely those of drinking to

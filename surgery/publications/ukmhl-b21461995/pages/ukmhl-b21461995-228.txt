218 LECTURE XVll. m If the child is tedious and fretful, the administration of a small quantity of the sjr. papav. alb. will answer the purpose of quieting it. I never saw the hare-lip or fissure in the under lip, but a cancerous affection to which it is liable requires the same ope- ration as that kind which I have described for an hare-lip : ac- cording to the extent of the division, the length of the incision towards the chin is to be made; the knife is to be carried from the upper part of the lip in an oblique direction towards the chin on one side the diseased part, and the same incision is to be made on the opposite side, so as to cut out a complete angular piece, and the parts are to be brought together by three sutures ; without the divisions are accurately made so as to form a complete angle, the parts cannot be brought closely together. When an hare-lip is complicated with a fissure in the roof of the mouth, a piece of sponge, joined by means of silk to a silver plate, will be found beneficial; the plate of silver must be made exactly adapted to the arch of the palate : the sponge is to be introduced into the fissure, and the plate attached to it is to remain in the roof of the mouth : the sponge being dry when inserted, absorbs moisture from the surrounding parts, and becomes so enlarged as to retain its position and the silver plate attached to it. But when the fissure extends to the soft palate, and is confined solely to the uvula and velum pendulum palati, there is no instrument can be used so as to remedy this defect, although a silver plate extending along the bony parts, has been attempted in various shapes.

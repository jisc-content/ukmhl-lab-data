166 LECTURE XIV; LECTURE XIV. ON HYDROCELE. hydrocele, derived from the Greek, u^w/i, water, and xÂ»iXht a tumour, is meant a collection of water in the vaginal coat of the testes; the cyst in which the fluid is contained will be bet- ter explained by the following anatomical description. The testicles are situated obliquely upwards, hanging loosely in the tunica vaginalis, the left being lower than the right. VSithin the scrotum is situated a bag, formed by the peritoneum, assum- ing the appearance of a bladder nearly empty, and taking the name of tunica vaginalis, and this membrane is reflected over the testicle, as the pericardium is over the heart. The testicle consequently has three coats: first, and the outermost, is the tunica vaginalis reflexa; secondly, the tunica vaginalis propria; and the third, the tunica albuginea. The epididymis is situated at the upper and outer side of the testicle, and by this circum- stance the right can be distinguished from the left. Between the tunica vaginalis propria, and reflexa, is naturally contained a vapour, which when condensed and collected in any consider- able quantity, forms the common hydrocele. The signs mark- ing an hydrocele are, first, a tumour will be observed in the lower part of the scrotum, and can be easily pressed from one extremity of it to the other: it gradually ascends from below upwards, as the sM-elling increases in bulk and size; it becomes light and elastic, and affording resistance to the hand on pres- sure : it extends over the anterior part of the scrotum, and is of a pyramidal shape, somewhat resembling a large pear: the upper part, or base, is considerably smaller than the lower: it is unattended with pain in general, and it is some time before the patient discovers it, and then accidentally, and this proceeds

The surgeon, embracing the tu- mour in his left hand, is to make an incision from one inch to one inch and a half of the spinous process of the pubis, com- mencing from the upper part of the abdominal ring, and ex- tending it through the integuments to the lower part of the tumour, the centre of the latter being the direction for the in- x^ision; by doing which the external pudic artery will be di- vided—it must be immediately tied, if it bleeds freely—in ge- neral there is no necessity for a ligature; this lays the aponeu- rosis of the external dblique, which forms a dense and distinct coverings, bare. The operator is next to make a small open- ing into this fascia in its middle, into which a director is to be introduced, so as to dilate it upwards (not of equal length with ^he first) to within an inch of the abdominal ring; this exposes the second covering of the sac, the cremaster muscle, which is to be divided precisely in the same cautious manner: not the ■least difficulty will be experienced in separating it from the parts underneath, as the connecting medium merely consists of loose cellular substance. The cremaster will be found as dense as the first, if the disease has long existed, and the best way to make an opening into it, is to nip it up between the fingers, and then introduce the point of the instrument care-

LECTURE XVI. 204 through it—the needle is to be moved gently upwards and backwards upon the crystalline lens, if the operator's object is to depress it to the bottom of the eye; or, on the side, if his intention is to cause its removal in that direction : the former is far preferable, as the lens will not be so likely to recover its situation again. The object to be kept in view, is to lacerate the inner surface of the lens, so that it may escape into the vi- treous humour: many deem it essential to the success of the operation, that the anterior layer of the capsule should be also lacerated, as the absorption of the lens will be much facili- tated. There are several advantages attending this operation—one is, the ease with which it is done; another is, that if the lens should happen to be in a fluid state, it will immediately escape on puncturing the capsule ; therefore it is pi eferable to be per- formed in children, as the lens is seldom found solid in them ; also if it should not succeed in the first instance, yet on account of the simplicity and ease with which it is done, it may be often repeated ; whereas in the mode by extraction, if a cure is not accomplished in the first instance, the eye will be inevitably lost. Mr. Hey, as well as other professional gentlemen, are of opinion, that the operation by couching is by far the best; however there are objections to it. In the Ji7'st place, the ca- taract is liable to rise again into its former place, and patients do not like to submit to repeated operations, thinking that the surgeon does not know what he is about. Secondly, it gives no relief in a capsular cataract—-it may be lacerated in the operation, and the rays of light may pass for a short time per- haps, but it will be soon obstructed by the broken pieces of the capsule rising again, and without they 'are absorbed, which is not very commonly the case, the disease will return again to its full extent. And lastly, it is unsuccessful when the capsule adheres to the iris. I would advise those gentlemen who wish to get credit for skill as oculists, to commence their practice with the extraction of the cataract; but those, on the contrary, who are likely to have but few operations, perhaps that of couching may answer

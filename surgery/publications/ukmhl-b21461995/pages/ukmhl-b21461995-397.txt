LECTURE XXXIL ON SIMPLE FRACTURES. The existence of fracture is generally easily known, by the altei-ation of shape which the limb undergoes : by the motion of the fractured part, and by the crepitus which may mostly be felt at the place where the bone is broken : if, however, one portion of bone IS not in contact with the other, crepitus will not exist, and tms sensation is not always to be depended upon ; as it may sometm.es be perceived when a fracture has not taken place : v/hen a part receives a blow, inflammation is produced there, by which coagulabJe lymph is thrown out: the pressure of this

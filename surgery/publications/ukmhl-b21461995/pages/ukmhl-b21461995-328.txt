LECTURE XXVir. 318 degree of constitutional irritation and fever: if it is not great, the limb may be saved, but the joint will be anchylosed. If the astragulus is also broken, a better expectation may be held out; for in all inflamed joints there must be an absorption of cartilage, and bony granulations formed, which will produce great and excessive constitutional irritation, so much so, that death often ensues; therefore, if the cartilaginous surface of the astragulus is broken off and comes away, there will be left only the cartilage at the lower part of the joint to be absorbed ; and hence, only half the risk is incurred. In Mr. Gooch and Mr. Hey we have advocates for sawing off the lower end of the tibia, for the above reason: this would seem to be a plausible plan, but I have never heard of its being successfully done. I really think removal of the limb, on the whole, would be pre- ferable in those cases where it might be deemed advisable. The young, and those who are not irritable, of a thin spare habit of body, are good subjects to endeavour to save the ex- tremity. If amputation is resolved, I am decidedly for its being done immediately: it will be folly to wait till inflamma- tion commences, the chances of saving the limb are few: adopt by all means the decisive and commendable practice of J. M. Larry; depend on it, more patients are saved by its speedy performance than if deferred to the suppurative stage; when done early, very seldom the patient does otherwise than well. If the wound is contused and extensive, no one will hesitate : here, as in all other cases where joints are exposed, the synovia escapes. In a good healthy constitution, notwithstanding, do not be in haste to operate; many cases do exceedingly well, and particularly in country practice, where the air is good.

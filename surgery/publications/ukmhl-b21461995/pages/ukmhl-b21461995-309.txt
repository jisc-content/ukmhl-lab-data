299 LECTURE XXVI. ed from the absorption of omentum, though a portion will still remain in the sheath; that part pushed forward through the falsiform process, and lying on the outer side of the fascia lata, will be nearly removed, in some cases entirely so. When strangulation takes place, the treatment will be very nearly the same as described for inguinal hernia; but the em- ployment of the taxis, in the tirst instance, varies a little. It is to be performed thus: â€” Standing over the patient, put two fingers upon the tumour and press downwards in a direct line, by which the prolapsed parts are pushed into the femoral sheath; then pressing upwards, they are returned into the abdo- men. If success is attempted by kneading it upwards at first, the surgeon only forces the tumour over the ligament, and hence it will be further from the opening into the abdomen than at first; for femoral heniia takes, instead of a direct, (as many imagined), a curved course ; the upper part being under, and the lower part over, Poupart's ligament. If the taxis fails, all the other means must be had recourse to, except the application of ice, which is not equally beneficial here as in inguinal hernia; because, in the scrotum it produces a regular contraction; but here is no portion of skin so arranged around the hernia to allow of any pressure. The tobacco glyster must not be forgotten, and if prudent means, continued sufficiently long, fail of afford- ing relief, the operation is the dernier resort. - Ope7'ation. A cut is to be made one inch and a half long, at right angles with Poupart's ligament, as far as the middle of the anterior part of the tumour; a transverse incision is then to be made at right angles with this, and the two corners of integuments are to be dissected up, in order to expose a considerable portion of tumour, otherwise, from its depth, and especially in a fat subject, the operation will be extremely difficult; a thin covering then comes in view, which is the aponeurosis of the external oblique, or fascia superficialis, a small opening is to be made through it, into which a director is to be passed, and by carrying a probe-point- ed bistoury along the groove, this covering is to be divided. The crural sheath, or fascia propria, is then exposed, which is

LECTURE X. 121 well defended from injuries. Sometimes, however, the bones are fractured, and a portion of the brain removed either by sharp instruments entering the skull, or by pieces of depressed bone. It may be supposed that these wounds would be immediately fatal, but they often do not affect the powers of the mind or body, and are dangerous only from inflammation supervening, and the shooting out of fungus. A man had a portion of the os frontis driven in on the cerebrum, part of the brain escaped from the wound to the quantity of a tea-spoonful with the pia mater on it, the wound healed without any bad symptoms, and the depression remained without any serious consequences arising from it. A boy likewise received a blow from a boat hook, which drove the right parietal bone in upon the brain: the brain was seen pulsating with a hole in it; he had a slight hemiplegia of the left side, the wouud healed without any un- toward symptoms, and the paralytic parts recovered the usual powers. Whenever a depression takes place, if the displaced bone be removed, no disagreeable symptoms ensue; it is in- flammation alone that occasions the death of the patient; when this is feared large quanlilies of blood may be taken ; af- ter the inflammatory stage, a fungus shoots out from the brain; this is found to be the subtance of the brain, granulating in a luxuriant state; as much as three or four ounces has been seen to be discharged this way : if, however, it continues any time, hemiplegia ensues, and the patient dies. If the wound is not Tery large, a piece of the fungus may be cut off even with the bone, then a piece of dry lint should be placed on it, and con- stant pressure kept up by a bandage; this treatment has often succeeded. Granulations from the dura mater shoot over the fungus and form a cicatrix.

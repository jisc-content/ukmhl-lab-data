404 LfiCTDRE XXXIII. Hunter asserted it was not so, and this is certainly the case wiih respect to the disease, as it cannot with propriety be termed hereditary, but there is scarcely any doubt but that the disposition to die disease is transmitted from parents to their children. The predisposing causes to the complaint are these, (let them be of whatever kind they hiay) which induce debility and a weakened state of the frame. Thus fevers of various kinds iriiay excite it, as that attendant on measles, small-pox, scarla- tina, or the mercurial fever. A great advantage is derived from the vaccine inoculation in this respect, as it leaves much less disposition to scrophula than the variolous does, as it does not excite that degree of fever which the latter mostly pro-^ duces. Want of nourishment is a frequent cause of the disease tn large cities, which is assisted very much by the confined air " which children are constantly in the habit of breathing, and ilso by a deficiency of a proper quantity of cloathing. The existing causes are not very obvious in many instances. The proximate cause of the disease consists in the original formation of a weak arterial system, and the powers of this system are much weaker in children who have a predisposition for scrophula, than those who enjoy health: the blood having as component parts a less portion of crassamentum and coagu- lable lymph : a proof of this is frequently met with in the dissecting room, for if it is wished to inject a scrophulous child, the injection will never be found to have passed into the extreme vessels, owing to the presence of a quantity of blood in them, which the last effort of life had not power of pro- pelling as usual into the veins ; giving evidence of the debili- tated state of the vascular system. If, in consequence of the existence of an inflammatory complaint, blood is drawn from a scrophulous child, on examiiiation it will be found to possess a smaller portion of crassamentum than that taken from a healthy child, and this will be also of a looser texture : but this last is entirely an effect of the weakened action of the arteries. The process of digestion will be found not to be so well performed, and this is to be all attributed to the want of good blood to fulfil the different offices of the assimilating system: the debt-

LECTURE XXXI. 574 heated with exercise, or otherwise s^o as to perspire, there is itching and slight pain. Venereal ertiptions are the mildest form of the secondary symptoms, and seldom prove fatal; in- stances have been seen where the patient was carried off. Treatment. Mercury, given internally, and also introduced into the con- stitution by friction, will be necessary. . If the eruptions are going on to a dangerous extent, the hydrarg. muriat. must be given dissolved in the spir. vin. rec. as often as three or four times daily. The best mode of giving it in feeble constitutions and tender bowels, is in small, but frequently repeated doses.

If the eruptions become very irritable, the nitric acid may be given with great advantage: it assists the mercury much by increasing the di- gestive powers, though it has little effect directly upon the disease. Some surgeons have asserted its capability of curing the disease, but I do not assent to this opinion: it is unques- tionably a most powerful auxiliary. With respect to local treatment, the eruptions always do better if allowed to remain without being touched by any preparation. The crust alone should be allowed to cover them, but should they seem dis- posed to ulcerate, calomel, united with mucilage, will be ad- vantageous to dress them. PHAGEDENIC ULCEK. This absurd term is applied to that species of ulcer, which often makes its appearance in consequence of the improper use of mercury ; that is by the employment of it during the in- flammatory stage of a bubo, or when it is in an irritable state. It is nothing more than a very irritable sore, and one which is thought generally extremely difficult to cure : the character

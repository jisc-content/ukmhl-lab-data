LECTURE XVI. pass as usual through the puncta lacrymalia into the lacrymal sac, they are prevented, from the obslruclion, taking their usual course into the nose, the sac becomes distended, inflamed, sup- purates and ulcerates, so that no prospect of cure can be ex- pected till the obstruction into the nose, the primary cause, is removed by an operation. The original cause of the affection is various; by some it is thought to proceed from a common cataract, by others from catarrhal affections in sciophulous habits, occurring more ge- nerally in children than in adults: next to these the venereal disease may be reckoned, and in this latter case the fistula la- crymalis cannot be expected to be used before the specific poison, gluing the parts together, is got rid of, and it has been known, though rarely, that the use of mercury in these cases has effectually cured both diseases. A pustule of the small-pox has been observed to have occasioned an obstruction in the duct, and not unfrequently this is the case. Professor Scarpa thinks that it originates from a yellow viscid matter, secreted by the lining of the eyelids, and from the meibomian glands, which accumulates in the sac. The treatment of the Jirst state of the complaint consists in passing the tube of a fine silver syringe into one of the puncta lacrymalia, so as to press against the other and close it, then let a single injection be thrown in, the more simple the better, as warm water; but if inflammation is present, a weak solution of acetate of lead will be proper; if the obstruction is not very considerable, or the ductus ad nasum only partially closed, so that the tears are able still, though not to the usual extent, to pass into the nose, this plan will be sufficient, as a free passage will thus be restored. The introduction of quicksilver will be found highly beneficial, proposed by Sir W. Blizard to be done through a tube. It is to be observed, some little force may be used prudently to restore the passage. I have merely con- sidered the obstruction in the simplest manner: should it be deemed to arise, according to Scarpa, from an altered secretion of the eyelids and meibomian glands, it will be right to employ applications to correct this morbid disposition, and a collyrium, composed of the sulphate of zinc, dissolved in rose water, 2

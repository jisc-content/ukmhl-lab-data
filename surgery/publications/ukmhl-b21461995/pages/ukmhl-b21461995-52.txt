42 LECTURE HI. and from the intimate connexion of the nerval with each other they call on their immediate neighbours for assistance ; that the command they possess over the circulation, produces a willmg compliance, and if the damage sustained is great, is transmitted to the sensorium; nature, ever on the afert Jets about the re-establishment. Hence, if the part is easily repaired, the constitution sufifers no interruption in its usual and ac- customed functions ; but if the part is of vital importance or the person of an extremely irritable habit, the general frame suffers m proportion to the violence of the injury. When the cause is removed, the nerves gradually resume their wonted powers, the arteries their natural diameters, the circulation its healthy standard, and the integuments their usual temperature: in fact, the whole tout ensemble their respective healthy avocations. ON THE TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. The treatment must be either local or constitutional: local when any particular part is the seat of inflammation; constil tutional, when any vital organ is afi-ected, causing the system generally to guffer, must be treated by free evacuations, as bleedmg, purging, 8cc. &c. The other, being merely a local disease, is best relieved by topical applications, such as cup- ping, leeches, &c. &c. By taking a large quantity of blood away in cases of general inflammatory action, relieves the constitution and nervous system much quicker than when it is drawn by a sparing hand; but this is to be regulated by the constitution, age, &c. of the patient. Here general rules only, with regard to bleeding, will be laid down. In inflammation of the lungs, when difficulty of breathing comes on, and the person's constitution is rather delicate, the taking away a small quantity of blood will be attended with more advantage, than where the contrary plan is followed ; about five or six ounces will commonly answer, and this may be repeated according to the urgency of the symptoms.

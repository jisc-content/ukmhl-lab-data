Bleeding must be had recourse to, to mitigate the severity of the inflammation, and the antiphlogistic plan strictly adhered - to. The patients should be kept as quiet as possible. WOUNDS OF THE JOINTS. Wounds made into the cavities of large joints are the most dangerous of those affecting the body almost in any instarice, on account of a very large surface becoming exposed, though the external wound be very small. If union does not take place by adhesion, inflammation to an alarming extent, and consequent suppuration, almost uniformly ensues, from the nature of the parts composing a joint: for it is not only the great extent of surface that becomes exposed to inflammation for the purpose of uniting, but the inner parts of a joint when inflamed are incapable of readily uniting by the adhesive, and mostly proceed to the suppurative process: and this goes on until the extremities of the bones exfoliate and granulations arise from their surface. This being the case the most violent " symptoms arise subsequent to a wound of a joint. When a wound is first inflicted, the synovia escapes, and this circum- stance is the criterion by which we judge whether the instru- ment has entered the cavity : if the lips of the wound are neatly and carefully brought together and they adhere, no further ex- tension of the mischief is to be apprehended; but if allowed to be left open, the discharge of the lubricating fluid will prevent union, and inflammation will most certainly ensue upon the whole internal surface, and a great quantity of matter will be formed which does not discharge itself directly out of the joint, but burrows itself both above and below the wound, and se- veral openings are frequently formed for the evacuation of the pus: the constitutional irritation will be extreme, and if the patient is not very strong, it will be necessary to amputate the limb ; but if his stamina is good, the patient may probably es- cape with anchylosis.â€”Treatment. It is required, in the first instance, to bring the edges of the wound together with ad^ hesive plaster, and if this cannot be readily done, sutures may

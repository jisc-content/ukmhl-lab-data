LECTURE X. 115 patient. In emphysema the air soon becomes absorbed, and it is seldom necessary to make small punctures in the cellular structure for its discharge, unless the collection is very large. If extravasation of blood into the cavity of the chest, from the wound in the lungs or intercostal arteries happens, as it very frequently doesj the difficulties are increased and the danger of the patient's dying from suffocation imminent, many advise the endeavouring to evacuate the effused blood—others prefer leaving it to be absorbed f the compression on the lung must be great, yet the danger of making fruitless efforts partially to get rid of it is still more serious, besides occasioning very probably a renewal of the haemorrhage, it would be all very well if the blood remained in a fluid state, in which case it might, by mere dilating the wound, be got rid of, combined with posture. The third danger is that in which, in spite of our efforts, the inflammation goes on to suppuration, and the effusion of a fluid; under these circumstances the symptoms are arising at a distant period. An example of this kind occurred some years ago in Guy's Hospital; a man attempting to arrest another was stab-* bed between the shoulders with a penknife, Avhich wounded the lung: the wound healed, and it was thought that he was recovering, but symptoms; evincing the existence of some fluid in the cavity of the chest, made their appearance—he went into the country, and soon after his return to town he died* On examination it was found, that a coagulum had formed in the cavity of the pleura, and it was supposed that this coagulum, not becoming vascular, acted as an extraneous body, and pro- duced inflammation and its ultimate consequences. This being the case, we should be on our guard in giving our prognosis of the safety or danger of these patients. WOUNDS or THE PERICAIIDIUM AND HEART. These wounds are but rarely seen in practice. Some time ago, a soldier on duty had a bayonet plunged into the right auricle, and what is surprising tbe man lived forty-eight houirg

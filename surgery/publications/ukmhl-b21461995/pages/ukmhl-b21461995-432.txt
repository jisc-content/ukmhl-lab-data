In proportion as the head is large are the intellects of the child more acute. The bones of the cranium not affording the usual resistance to the growth of the brain, it increases more rapidly in size than those who are healthy- The spine becomes distorted laterally, and there are always two incurvations, so as to preserve the perpendicular state of the body ; the ribs, instead of being arched, are nearly straight, and this occasioning a projection of one of the shoulders; the pelvis is altered in its shape, the pnbes ap- proaching each other, and the sacrum much incurvated; the thigh, the tibia and fibula, as well as the radius and ulna are all bent forwards.

Friction upon the iimbs will be of considerable advantage, in assisting the powers of tlie circulation by mechanical aid : it may also be serviceable to bathe the body in cold salt water twice daily j the little additional stimulus the salt gives, will assist in

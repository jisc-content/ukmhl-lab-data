LECTURE XVII. S'lS give preference to the lancet. Having placed the patient in an horizontal posture, with the liead a little elevated, a flannel roller is to be applied on the upper part of the abdomen, and gradually drawn tighter as the water is drawn oiF, in order to support the patient by moderate pressure during the evacua- tion, as such a quantity of fluid being so suddenly drawn off, would occasion fainting, &c; then pass a trocar or lancet in the linea alba, from one inch to two or three below the navel, ^s on one side of that line there will be some danger of wound- ing the epigastric artery : if it is the trocar that is used, and a sudden stop of the discharge happens when withdrawn, pass a blunt probe through the canula, in order to discharge any thing that may obstruct the free passage of the fluid through the tube. I think myself that the lancet is the most preferable instrument, and I have known instances where it has been used tfiat the patients would by no means submit to the introduction of the trocar in a future operation ; besides there is some risk attending the latter, for the end of the canula has been known, when the patient coughed, to lacerate the mesentery, by first rubbing against the peritoneum, and the result proved fatal, high inflammation having corne on. A gentleman at Chiches- ter proposed, some years ago, to cure dropsy by leaving an ivory canula in the abdomen for some time, and he related some cases where it succeeded : I shall offer no remark on the sub- ject. The quantity of fluid contained in this disease, is very great, and during my apprenticeship Mrs. Davies had evacu- ated at seven different operations, with a short interval between each, a large pailful each time : she died soon after the last from debility. This case convinced me to what an extent it vrill accumulate, as well as the time it took, after each opera- tion, to re-produce the effects of the disease to its former ex- tent, and as far as I recollect, the intervals gradually lessened. When the operation is finished, apply merely a piece of dry lint on the wound made, and support it by adhesive plaster, and bind round the abdomen a flannel bandage.

LECTURE XV. 182 the aneurism to be popliteal, the old method was thus : a tour- niquet was to be applied in the same direction as in amputa- tion, an incision was to be made into the ham from the upper to the lower part of the tumour, which was completely to be exposed ; the clot of blood which the aneurism contained, was removed from the sac, and the orifice of the artery, being marked by momentarily loosening the tourniquet; it was again to be fixed, a probe was passed into the upper orifice of the artery, and an incision being made on each side of it, a needle and ligatuVewas passed about an inch on each side of the vessel, and firmly tied, and the tourniquet again slackened : the place where the blood flowed from the lower orifice was marked, and an incision and ligature made on it as above: the blood in the tumour was generally of a venous colour. This operation was seldom at- tended with success, so little so, as to deter surgeons very often from performing it; several unpleasant circumstances resulting from its adoption, as violent inflammation being brought on from such an immense cavity being exposed, (as it appears from subsequent experience, unnecessarily), and independently of this, the chances were that an exfoliation of bone would take place, so as to produce a stiffness in the limb: these disagree- able circumstances attending the old method of operating, in- duced the late John Hunter to make trial of a new mode, which I consider undoubtedly quite original: notwithstanding the priority of this, as well as every other improvement, has been contested by succeeding writers, as being known by the indst ancient surgeons from some obscure passage that had siiiik into oblivion many centuries before their day. The French jealousy is more pardonable, when the foibles of that nation are considered, and I take this opportunity of stating my belief, that the greatest blemish in D. J. Larrey's work, is his unwarrantable boasting, that the French surgical practice was so pre-eminently superior to the English: as this does not apparently to me exist, 1 think it might have been omitted. I believe it vfill be allow^ed by all those who had the honour of knowing John Hunter, that he entertained no great predilec- tion for the ancient writings, neither was he at all aware that smy similar plan had been peviously adopted: from manu- S

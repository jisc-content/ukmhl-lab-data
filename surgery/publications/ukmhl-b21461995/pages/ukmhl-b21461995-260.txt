/ 250 LECTUUE XX. ON AURA EPILEPTICA. The singular affection, wliichhas obtained the above name, is very similar to the preceding disease. It is commonly supposed to have its origin in the particular nerve of a part, but from what I have seen, and especially from the history of a case which occurred in Guy's Hospital, I am of opinion that it has its origin in the brain. The person who at that time laboured under this complaint was about twenty-four years of age; a peculiar kind of tingling sensation came on generally in the evening in the thumb, which extended up the arm along the course of the radial nerve, until it reached the shoulder, when a violent epileptic fit immediately took place, which commonly lasted about half an hour. After it was over the patient ap- peared as well as ever, and his appetite equally good. It was conceived, that by dividing the radial nerve at the part where he felt first the sensation, that the complaint would have been eradicated, and accordingly five-eighths of an inch was dissect- ed off; but it was not attended with any degree of success; and what is very singular, he felt the same sensation in his thumb as before : having, therefore, given it a fair trial, and not attained the wished for success, the conclusion was drawn that its origin was in the brain, and not in the particular nerve, and there would, in any future case, be a doubt of the propriety of any operation: the only method that could be rationally adopted â– would consist in regularity in diet, exercise, change of air, &c. and the exhibition of the carbonate of soda. Mr. Abernethy removed half an inch in length of the nerve going to the ring finger of the left hand, in the case of a lady afflicted with tic douloureux in the integuments under and near the inner edge of the nail of her finger. The skin, &,c. reco- vered its sensibility in three months in a great measure, but relief was not afforded to the extent anticipated. The part had been previously cauterized.

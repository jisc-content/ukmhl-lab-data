I,ECTURE XXXII. ggy on account of the softening of the bone at this part, which it universally obtains at an advanced period of life. Various at- tempts have been made to cure patients, by keeping the limb extended for a long time; but none have succeeded in effecting a union. ON COMPOUND FRACTURES. These differ from simple fractures, in being accompanied with a wound which communicates with the bone internally, and with the air externally; so that if the external wound does not communicate with the extremities of the bone which is- broken, it is not a compound fracture : therefore large wounds may be seen with fracture, and yet that fracture still be a sim- ple one. The process of union is similar to that which takes place in a case of simple fracture, though in the latter there is no discharge of matter; but in the former there is this appear- ance—a cartilaginous kind of substance is deposited in the first instance between the broken ends of the bone; this is partly taken up by the absorbents, and ossific matter is replaced in heu of it: granulations arise very soon from the surface of this and matter is thrown out to protect them from the drying ac- tion of the air. If a surgeon is called to a case of simple compound fracture he should place a little dry lint over the wound, in order to' arrest the flow of blood which may be issuing forth—a little pressure will easily effect this. When the bleeding has ceased, he is to make extension of the limb, in order to bring the ends of the bone into direct apposition with each other. If there is great resistance to this, by the contraction of the muscles and twuchmgs occur in these parts of a spasmodic kind, he must desist, and the leg being placed upon a pillow, must be wrapped m an emollient poultice for four or five days until the irritation has abated, when extension may be made without difficulty ^ut supposing this degree of resistance is not met with, extend the limb as far as is desirable, then bring the edges of the wound into contact as near as possible, and cover it with dr.

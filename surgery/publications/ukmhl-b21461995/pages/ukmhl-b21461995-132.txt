LECTDRE XI. li a ball has passed out opposite to where it entered, it is to LECTURE XL ON GUN SHOT WOUNDS. Any substance that enters the body with a degree of velocity occasions the same consequences as a gun-shot wound, as from the blowing up of a rock, &c. These wounds differ from in- cised in this, that from the contusion received, they most commonly terminate in a sinus ; they are of two kinds, that in which the ball has passed through, and that when it still remains lodged in the body. When a surgeon is called to an accident of this nature, from the smallness of the aperture he is led to doubt the possibility of a ball having entered the body: but this appearance depends upon its being received either point blank, or in a slanting direction, also on the size of the ball: it, however, generally enters at right angles. The wound has a black aspect around its edges, like an eschar produced by a caustic. In the course of a few hours inflammation supervenes to a much greater degree than that following an incised -wound; thiÂ§ is shewn by the swelling not being confined to the part, but sup- posing the leg to be wounded extending along from the knee even to the thigh. The first discharge of the wound is of a jelly-like appearance, being composed of coagulable lymph. This has been known to have been removed from day to day hy an experienced French surgeon, who was not aware that he was counteracting Nature's first efforts towards a cure. This lymph adheres and is now and then vascular. After continu-' ing four or five days, a slow and gradual process of suppura- tion comes on, which is not complete until from the 10th to the 14th day; so that this takes a much longer time than in an incised wound, especially if any tendinous structure has been injured. The eschar must necessarily separate before sup- puration is complete, which accounts for the slowness of this last process.

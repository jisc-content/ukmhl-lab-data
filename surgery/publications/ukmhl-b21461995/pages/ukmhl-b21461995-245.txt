LECTURE XIX. 235 piece of each bandage ; the thighs are then to be separated, and the other bandage is to be applied so as to secure the knees towards the neck, drawing the thighs up to the abdomen; the nates of the patient being made to project a little over the edge of the table, the surgeon is to be seated in a chair before, and rather to the patient's right side ; and before he makes his in- cision into the membranous parts of the urethra, a staff, with a groove in it of a proportionable size, and a little more bent than the sound, is to be introduced, the groove being on its convex part for the purpose of receiving the beak of the gorget; a double-bladed knife is then necessary for the purpose of cut- ting into the membranous part of the urethra; with this in- strument there is an advantage over those in use formerly, as the opening can be made either large or small, or if it is found convenient, the groove in the staff must be laid bare, and the beak of the gorget is to be introduced into it: the staff is then to be taken from the assistant, and drawing it gradually towards him, he is to push the gorget forwards in an horizontal direc- tion until it has entered the bladder, which is immediately known by the escape of urine and the percussion of one instru- ment against another. The staff is now to be withdrawn, and a pair of forceps introduced along the groove of the gorget— move them about till the stone is struck against, when the blades are to be opened cautiously, and the stones grasped at the least diameter, which will be known by the expansion of the handles of the forceps—it must then be extracted under the arch of the pubes, inclining it rather downwards. If the stone is too large to pass the angle formed by the rami of the ischia, a strong forceps, contrived for the purpose, must be passed up, so as to break it into pieces. The gorget has been mostly in use till latterly, and some considerable improvements have been made in its shape, and the last of all by Mr. Cline, who was for years considered the best lithotomist in England, and used no other instrument than this in finishing the operation. Not only Sir W. Blizard, but more lately Mr. Astley Cooper has made an alteration in this respect, and substituted a knife, which, as far as I can judge, is not only more simple, but far preferable to the gorget, as

How a spasm in the extreme arteries, supporting an increased action in their course, as Cullen remarks, can be considered as the proximate cause of inflammation in all cases not arising from the application of direct stimuli, must be argued on this principle: that when glandular structures are inflamed, they cease to secrete as usual; but this is only when they are gene- rally, not partially inflamed; as in the latter case their secretions become augmented rather than diminished. The famous Hunter says, inflammation is to be considered, merely as a disturbed state of parts, requiring a new salutary action to reinstate them in their original position: it ought strictly speaking, not to be deemed a disease, but as a salutary operation. Again, he says, it is to be considered as an increased action of the vessels of the part, an increase or distension beyond their original size and diameter; it is not a relaxation, but merely temporary dilatation, and a necessary operation per- formed by nature. To render this intricate subject as intelligible as can be, it will be necessary to enumerate a few of the preceding remarks. We are not to consider arteries as tubes formed merely on mechanical principles, to transmit a certain fluid: their mus- cularity, their elasticity and vital powers being so well known, ought to induce us to give them more important offices ; and whatever theory may be hereafter introduced, this ought to be borne in mind ; that they are temporary and visibly enlarged m an inflamed part, our senses ought to allow, if open to convic- tion, and that an increase in the circulation of the part is also manifest. How many go thus far and halt, perfectly satisfied; but I should imagine, that let the cause of inflammation be what it may, the first and primary cause of all, must be on the organs of sensation—the nerves of the part; and hence I should say, that the ultimate proximate cause of inflammation, as far as it can be traced, would be, that the sensibility of the part affected becomes increased, that it would appear, if I may be allowed to express myself, as if first susceptible of the injury, 4

The tumour totally disappeared; his intel- lect was perfect, his nervous system unafiiected, and the very severe pain which he endured upon the same side of the head, previous to the operation, he has never experienced since; a hoarseness which he had prior continued, though it was not then so much as it had been. Mr. Benjamin Travers tied the carotid artery in a woman, who laboured under an aneurism by anastomosis in the left orbit, by which the eye had been pro- truded from its socket, accompanied by distractiug headachs: two small round ligatures were applied, but the artery was not divided; they separated on the twenty-first and twenty-second day, without hasmorrhage, or any alteration in the functions of the brain, and the tumour was absorbed: the effect of the liga- tures, upon the artery, coincided with Mr. Cooper's successful operation. These two operations put the practicability of the operation being performed with success beyond the shadow of a doubt, and to render success more certain, it would be advisable to adopt it early, before the tumour has increased to any consider- able size, so as to affect the oesophagus or trachea. Mode of Operating.-—An incision is to be made oppo- site the centre of the thyroid cartilage, to within one inch of the clavicle, on the inner side of the stemo-cleido-mastoideus, having exposed this muscle, turn the margin of it aside, and then the omo hyoideus comes into view, crossing the sheath of the vessels, and also the descendens noni: in separating the stemo-cleido-mastoideus from the omo hyoideus, the jugular vein is seen; the vacillating motion of this vessel, which is in- creased in respiration (so that without care it will be liable to be wounded), presents the greatest difficulty in the operation— a finger is to be introduced into the wound, to keep the vein out of the way, under which lies the carotid artery. It is of the greatest consequence, not to injure or include the par vagum, which is situated immediately between the vein and artery, a little to the outer side of the latter, as such a mistake would prove fatal, and also the recurrent nerve, which is at-

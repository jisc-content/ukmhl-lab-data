304, LECTURE XXVI. I in the sac forming a pouch, so that a part of the contents can be returned, and yet the symptoms of strangulation still exist. When the operation (which is rather simple) is necessary, it may be done thus: make a transverse incision across the middle part of the tumour, and carry another from this to the lower part, so as to form two flaps; then open the sac care- fully, and having found the seat of stricture, divide it above and below, as there is no danger of wounding any vessel: return the contents, and bring the flaps down, so that the process of adhesion may take place. In case the hernia is very large, and has long been irreducible, cut down upon the upper part of the tumour, which lays bare the linea alba above the aper- ture, into the abdomen; having exposed it and the sac, intro- duce a probe pointed bistoury between the two; but do not cut into the sac, only, as in large inguinal hernia, divide the tendon of the external oblique muscle. VENTRAL HERNIA. This is very nearly the same as the umbilical, only that it occurs in the linea alba, linea semilunaris, &c. An artery and vein frequently pass through these tendons, but do not com- pletely occupy the opening, which, from malformation, allows the passage of the hernia. The linea alba has been seen de- ficient from the umbilicus to some distance. Treatment. A very broad belt is to be bound round the body, after the contents are returned, and constantly worn. The opera- tion has been performed, although very rarely. In operatmg, supposing the hernia to be at the lower part of the linea semi- lunaris, divide upwards, as the epigastric artery lies contigu- ous. "With respect to the other varieties in situation, no par- ticular observations will be required.

There are three different species of these. When this tu- mour is situated in the liver, it is formed by a great number of hydatids adhering to the internal surface of one large one, and these fill up the cavity. Each of these vesicles is fed by small vessels going into it, as in the larger ones. They are truly considered at the present time, as consisting of animals sur- rounded by a fluid, and this fluid retained by a cyst. They are most frequently found in the cavity of the abdomen, on the liver, omentum, &c.; one or two cases have been met with when they were present between the bladder and rectum, in which situation they occasioned many unpleasant symptoms to both of those parts, by obstructing the execution of their functions. The second species of hydatid tumour is that which is existing in the form of a stalk, from which several oval tumours will depend : these are most commonly found on the placenta, and those hydatid swellings occasionally met with in the cavity of the nose growing from the pituitary membrane, partakes of the nature of these. A third species consists in those which are formed in the cellular membrane. This kind is sometimes met with, ad- hering to the surface of the ovarium, and when very much dis- tended, is taken for ovarian dropsy. BURSAL TUMOURS, or GANGLIONS. These tumours consist of collections of serous fluid within the bursae mucosae: they are met with on the different parts where these numerous bags exist, frequently on the wrist, on the fibula, and on the tibia, &c. The best mode of treatment is by bursting them by means of a blow given with a flat hard substance, as a book. When this is smartly applied, it will generally succeed in rupturiog the cyst, which the fluid is con-

LECTURE XXVIl. 306 LECTURE XXVII. ON DISLOCATIONS. There are very few accidents so likely to be mistaken, and their nature properly ascertained, as dislocations, and they arc sometimes found extremely difficult to be reduced, and have baffled the skill of some surgeons completely. A slight sud- den force will produce such an injury when the muscles are unprepared. The lower Jaw.—This bone is often dislocated, either from yawning, or a slight blow received on it when the mouth is open, by which the condyloid processes slip under the zy- goma; one only, or both condyles may be thus displaced: if both, the nature of this accident is very obvious: the patient cannot shut his mouth,* and the under teeth project much more than the upper forwards; if on one side only^ the mouth is turned to one side. To reduce it, put handkerchiefs round your thumbs, or thick cloths, then grasp the dislocated bone firmly on each side; the condyles are to be then depress- ed, and the chin elevated. The thumbs are immediately with- drawn, as they would be in danger of being wounded unless protected, as I have described, from the force and violence with which the ends of the bone slip into their places. If it is difficult, take a piece of wood, and put it between the mo- lares teeth—direct a person to go behind, and hold the pa- tient's head steady—then put your hands under his chin, and lift up his jaw as much as you can, and by means of this lever it is tilted into its place. Cervical Vertebra.—Dislocations between the first and second cervical vertebrae, produce instant death ; the denti- form process is broken off: this is the only part liable to such an

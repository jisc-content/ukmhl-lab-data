LECTURE XVI. the imperfect vision, if I may so terra it, is more or less so according to the strong or weak action of the rays of light, as I have above remarked, and it is on this account that the vision, partially obscured as it is, yet is rendered better in the evening, the rays of light then proceeding from that luminous body, the sun, being much weaker, and consequently the pupil is more dilated. A cataract appears as a speck or spot in the lens, through the pupil in the first instance becoming gradually enlarged, till the whole of it appears through the aperture to be of a whitish colour, as vision becomes insensibly lessened and diminished, but is not altogether obscured. Occasionally it is found of a greyish cast, and at other times remarkably white, and appa- rently opaque, resembling a pearl, or the eye of a fish boiled. The crystalline humour, when converted into a cataract, is most commonly white, but not invariably so, as it is sometimes of a yellow, and also of a reddish brown colour, which latter appearance renders the disease obscure. In adults it is mostly, but not always, of a solid texture throughout: it has occasion- ally been found in a fluid state, at other times a mixture of ' both, and when removed in the operation the fluid part escapes first: the distinguishing marks, whether it is solid or fluid, are, that when the latter happens, it is of a perfect uniform colour, and when the former, it has a radiated and strealcT/ appearance; there is considerable advantage in knowing this, because the respective operations for each are different. It is very rare, indeed, that the crystalline lens has been seen ossified, and I recollect to have heard mentioned of but one instance having been so seen. If the lens is hard and opaque, it is termed a firm hard cataract, if fluid a milk^ cataract, and if of the con- sistence of jelly a soft cataract. The capsule itself is some- times opaque, as well as the lens; to distinguish it, it is only necessary to observe attentively the close connexion between the pupil and the cataract, the iris resting on the latter: some- times the capsule adheres to the edges of the iris, and in this case the operation is very unsuccessful: an easy way of know- ing when this has taken place, is by introducing a small portion of the extract of belladonna (deadly nightshade), with a camel

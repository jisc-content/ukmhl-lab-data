LECTUIIE IV. 50 No operation, not even the simplest, could take place, with safety, witliout the adhesive process ; for after the operation of venesection, if it were not for this mode of union, the vein would inflame, and this extending along its coats, through the valves, even to the heart itself, which must necessarily prove fatal. Many other cases could be mentioned further illustra- tive of this subject, such as tapping in ascites, and in the ope- ration for strangulated hernia, where, if the peritoneum and intestines did not adhere, death would be the result; amputa- tions might also be alluded to ; and with respect to this latter operation, there is one question I would wish to put to you, that is, why is it found so necessary to save so much of the skin or integuments ? to this it may be answered, that it is for the purpose of glueing or connecting it with the ends of the muscles: and from thence proceeds the necessity of cleaning the stump of any foreign body, as naturally tending to prevent that desired process, and perhaps it may not be amiss to men- tion a circumstance which occasionally happens to unskilful practitioners; tlie impropriety of removing the dressings a few days after the operation has taken place is here alluded to, in order, as they say, to see how the limb appears, but it must be evident to every thinking man, in this they act extremely wrong, as it tends precisely to destroy, by their officiousness, that mode which nature has intended for the restoration of the parts. It is only warranted in those cases where, from the ex- cess of pain, the patient complains of in the amputated part, and you have reason to suspect there is matter confined which causes the pain, and even here it would be preferable, merely to slip through the adhesive"plaster, in order to give vent to the confined matter, without removing all the dressings. The same adhesive process takes place in hard as well as in the soft parts of the body, the bones for instance, only that in them, a gelatine is secreted, and in the soft parts lymph is depo- sited to cover the edges of the fractured bones, either simple or compound: with the exception that, in the latter accident, this process is hindered from being completed by the formation of pus and granulations. One more proof in favour of the adhesive process will be 3

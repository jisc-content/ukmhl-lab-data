LECTURE Vllr, 94 ^vhile before he became perfectly recovered, which change of air materially contributed to. If the puncture is deep, the nitric acid may be used, as the caustic will scarcely reach the bottom of it; these wounds have been converted by some surgeons into simple incised wounds, by boldly laying them open; but unless the wounds are deep, it is better practice to use the caustic liberally, as it w ill ever be attended with a prevention of the symptoms. Although many have attempted to account for the pheno- mena, attendant upon these apparently trivial wounds, yet a great deal very unsatisfactory and inconclusive has been ad- vanced ; every thing depends on the form of the wound ; when a sharp-pointed instrument perforates the body, the cells of the cellular membrane are exposed, and that termination of the absorbent vessels into these cavities: hence they become inflamed, and a progressive inflammation is set up in these -vessels, until they reach the next gland; but when an incised Avound occurs, blood is effused into the cavity, or coagulable lymph, by which the extremities of the vessels, of the absor- bents, are covered, and thus are prevented from removing into an inflamed state. The author cannot reconcile himself agreeable to the doc- trine of one of the ablest teachers in town, and previously/ laid down, that the numerous wounds occasioned in the dissecting; rooms, are not to be attributed to any other cause than merely the form of such wounds, and the patient's irritability. He has been wounded himself repeatedly (and seen others) with impunity, when the hooks or knives have been clean; but ii they had slipped, accidentally, out of the bod}', as most fre- quently happens, and occasioned those wounds, much greater apprehensions would be entertained. A wound made with a clean needle, for instance, will be productive of little injury; but if precisely inserted in a similar place, when removed, from a dead body: no man would venture to say no difference would be perceptible, as it is daily seen during the winter months ; there must be a slow and gradual change in a body from its loss of vitality to a state of putridity, and the nearer the

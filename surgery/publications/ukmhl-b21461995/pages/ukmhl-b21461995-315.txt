305 J.ECTURE XXVI. PUDENDAL HERNIA. The hernial sac protrudes on the inner branch of the is- chium ; it occurs very rarely. Mr. Cooper saw a case stran- gulated; it appeared at the labium ; he reduced it, and in doing so, he found that his finger had passed up the vagina to the pelvis : a sponge was ordered to be applied. A gentleman, whose name I do not remember, relates a case where the blad- der occupied the part. PERINEAL HERNIA, &C. A case of this kind was discovered in one of the dissecting rooms. A tumour was observed between the bladder and rec- tum ; it nearly reached the apex of the prostrate, and on ex- amination, it proved to be an hernial sac, containing a portion of intestine. The vagina is sometimes pushed forward by hernia, situated between it and the rectum: a case of this kind occurred at Guy's Hospital, in a girl; when she stood upright, the tumour appeared on the outside of the labia, but was easily returned in an horizontal posture by pressure on the upper part of the va- gina. A pessary was ordered to be worn. This species of hernia now and then causes suppression of urine. The existence of hernia at the foramen ovale, cannot be ascertained in the living subject, consequently no operation can be performed. It is always very small. Hernia at the ischiaiic notch, descends and rests upon the sciatic nerve, between this and the obturator and gluteal ar- teries ; the latter being above, and the pyriformis muscle be- low : if it should happen to be very large, it may be operated on; but it very rarely occurs. I have been shewn two specimens of hernia through the dia- phragm. In hernia of the mesa-colon, and mesentery, a separa- tion of the laminae takes place, forming an aperture into which the hernial sac protrudes.

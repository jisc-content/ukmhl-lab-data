If the bone is out for a considerable time, and there is considerable difficulty, carry a bandage under a table on which a person is resting^ and by bending the leg till the heel nearly touches the back part of the thigh, and the head of the bone is near the acetabulum, endeavour to tilt it backwards into the socket. PATELLA. â€¢The patella may be dislocated, either inwards or outwards, from sudden falls, or from a particular relaxity of the parts. I have known such an accident to happen, from a very trifling cause, to a servant girl living in my father's service; indeed, the great mobility of her joints was not confined to the knee, but it extended to her wrists and fingers. When the patella is thrown out of its place, the signs are, the bone appearing either to one side or the other, and the straightness of the knee. The mode of reduction is very simple; it consists in pressing down the outer edge of the patella, by this means the inner edge is elevated, while the muscles inserted into it soon bring into its former place. Extension is sometimes necessary first, before pressure is used. It sometimes happens that there is a lacera- tion of the capsular ligament, by which the patella is drawn up, as in fracture; the same means for restoring it to its situation are necessary as in fracture, and it is afterwards to be retained by proper bandages. In tljle dislocation I have above alluded to, it occurred outwards, which is the most frequent accident. It must be retained by a proper bandage, and lotions used of vinegar and water, or the liq. acet. p. dil. TIBIA. The dislocation of the tibia may be either inwards or but' wards, or the head of the tibia may be thrown backwards, behind the condyles; if outwards, the lateral ligament is only ruptured; if inwards, the external and crucial ligaments a/e 4

LECTURE XX, 246 in the testicle and epididimis; and as the disease is slow, and does not extend by absorption, an operation will be attended with success. There is another disease liable to affect the testes, and which requires an operation, although not for the entire removal of the testicle : it is that of ?l fungus projecting from it. Castration here is not necessary, as exposing the patient to unnecessary danger and deprivation. All that is requisite to be done is, to make an incision down on each side of it in the scrotum, and divide the fungus at its neck: then bring the scrotum together by a ligature, and apply a poultice, &c. to subdue the excess of inflammation. There was a case some time ago at Guy's Hospital, where the surgeon removed the testicle completely, and the consequence was fatal. ON CASTRATION. Shave the hair off the pubis; make an incision from the upper part of the abdominal ring, and continue it down to the bottom of the scrotum : by extending the incision to the lower part of the scrotum, matter is prevented from accumulating there during the cure : then, if a puncture has not been previ- ously made with a lancet, (which ought, in the first instance, cautiously to be done) cut through the tunica vaginalis, and ob- serve if there is any water or fluid contained: having done so, lay bare the spermatic chord perfectly at the ring : if the chord is hardened, expose it about an inch higher in the oblique canal: as soon as this is done, direct an assistant to take hold of the chord between his finger and thumb, keeping it steady, then divide it, and drawing the chord to you, detatch the cellular membrane behind it, which is easily removed: then take up the spermatic artery and that of the vas deferens with a tenaculum, and secure them by ligature. The external pudendal artery, and also some other small branches which enlarge under disease, will perhaps require securing. Surgeons formerly used to pass a ligature around the whole chord very tight, but this has now very justly been laid aside, as it was altogether unnecessary, and gave such excessive pain.-The testicle is easily detached.-

GENTLEMEN, It has been my wish, for the last four years, to see a Work of this description published. It is presented to you in the familiar form of Lectures: and I trust and believe it mill be found to contain as concise and faithful a viem of the most approved Practice of Surgery, at this present day, as any Work extant. I can only assure you, it has been to me a r,ery arduous undertaking: that it may prove as useful to you as a Guide and Director, as my friends have had the presumption to anticipate, will he extremely gratifying; and amply compensate me for the great length of time devoted exclusively to this pursuit. I am, Gentlemen, With great respect, Your very obedient Servant, THE AUTHOR.. London, September, 1818.

LKCTURE VII. 85 adhesion takes place, which glues the edges fast together; in ob- serving the process of nature in healing womids, the opinion that was formerly entertained of the bond of union, as this pro- cess was then termed, between the divided parts, is entirely ex- ploded. No wound is united by the blood alone, it was then thought that a coagula of blood was the uniting medium, but there is only one example of the healing of wounds, in which it happens that a clot of blood acts as an auxiliary to the healing process, and this is in the division of arteries. If a ligature is applied upon an artery, there is a clot of blood immediately formed within this artery, just above the ligature, but it does not become the immediate bond of union: inflammation takes place on the inner membrane of the vessel: coagulable lymph is poured out, and the part ultimately becomes organised by the elongation of the original vessels. But setting aside this one solitary example, we shall not find a parallel one, in which the blood forms the uniting bond. If a muscle or a tendon be divided with a sharp instrument, the reunion first ensues by the effusion of coagulable lymph into the cavity of the wound, and also whenever we are anxious to produce union by adhesive in- flammation. The first necessary step must be'to clear away all the sur- rounding blood, and that between the lips of the wound, and unless this is done, it M'ill preveiit the adhesion, by being inca- pable of being rendered vascular; after this the parts are to be brought together neatly and closely by the adhesive straps, and supported by proper bandages. In the course of a few days, coagulable lymph having been thrown out, vessels may be traced into this newly formed sub- stance, and these are found to proceed from the divided ves- selsj as well as from the surrounding cellular membrane. I have seen the tendo achilles of a dog which had been divided purposely, ten days before, at the end of which time the dog was killgd, and the process examined; there was about an inch of newly formed tendon, and this was rendered vascular, accord- ing to the above-mentioned manner; to produce this, an increas- ed action is set up in the surrounding parts. It is found that the newly formed part mostly takes oo the H 2 I

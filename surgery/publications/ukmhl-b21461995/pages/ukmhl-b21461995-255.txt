J-ECTURE XX. 245 ing it—no inequality or hardness is perceptible—no change in the scrofmn: as the disease increases, it gets soft and elastic, dnd has that pulpy feel, from whence the name originally was taken. This mass, it would appear, is composed of lymph, pervaded by a great number of vessels, differing from other si- milar deposits in this respect, that it is much softer, and less ca- pable of resisting the impetus of the blood. It is a most mista- ken notion to imagine, that it is an unorganized mass, for it is the contrary. The equal surface and deceptive feel of fluctuation which it presents in the more advanced state, has misled a sur- geon to imagine it to be hydrocele, and it was punctured with a trocar; but in fungus haeraatodes the testicle gradually en- larges, then the spermatic chord, and by the disease extending along it, the inguinal glands, which acquire an immense size. On examining the spermatic chord, several tumours are found around it of the same structure as that of the diseased testis so even of the inguinal glands, and of the absorbents, even to the thoracic duct, which has become obstructed in the more ad- vanced stages of the disease, and a pulpy medullciry substance thrown out on its forming a tumour. It has been supposed, that from the rapid progress of the disease when once formed, it is impossible to operate with any rational prospect of suc- cess ; but this is not altogether true, as in the nery early stages of the disease, it may be attempted. This melancholy dis- ease occurs more frequently, it is said, in 7/oung subjects than those more advanced in life. I presume I have said already sufficient to convince the profession, that on the very early performance of the operations, rests the probability of cure • and I should consider it hopeless if deferred till the the sper- matic chord was affected along its course—should this be the case, and the inguinal glands also, the less the surgeon does, the better, for death is inevitable. The fourth disease of the testis, is that of scrofulous affec- tion in the anterior of this organ ; a person who has received a blow on this part may be liable to it, if his system is so disposed already from subsequent inflammation, extending to the labuli, and instead of lymph, curd-like matter mixed with pus has been found on dissection: a considerable enlargement takes place s 2

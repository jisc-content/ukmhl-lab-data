LECTURE XXII, 258 LECTURE XXII. ON AMPUTATION. pREVlors to performing this operation, a tourniquet is to be properly applied, so as to make sufficient pressure on the principal artery: if the lower extremity is to be removed, it should be secured one-third the thigh downwards, as the ar- tery passes here close to the bone, and can be readily com- pressed ; if the upper extremity, it should be put on two-fifths downwards on the upper edge of the biceps muscle. Fingers or Toes.â€”The same method is applicable to feither. If the second or third joint of the former requires to be amputated, let an assistant, with a piece of tape, separate the fingers so as to leave enough of room ; then make a cir- cular incision beyond the joint, and a cut on each side as'far as the joint, for the purpose of forming two flaps, which are to be raised; then turning the finger on one side, divide the tendons and lateral ligaments on the inner and lateral parts, and pass the knife into the joint and separate it, the flaps are then, to be brought together and retained with adhesive plaster. Th&jirst joint is rather more difficult, and this consists in the situation ; for it should be recollected it is from the knuckle about the one-eighth part of an inch. There are two lateral or angular incisions to be made, and supposing it is the forefinger, the first is to be on the outside and carried to the back of the joint, the other in a similar direction cutting be- tween the fingers, so that both incisions may meet, forming a kind of triangle; the extensor and two flexor tendons are next to be divided down to the joint, then depress the finger, cut the ligament open and separate the finger; the parts are to be brought together with adhesive plast er.

LECTURE XXV, . QQl LECTURE XXV. OF LARGE INGUINAL HERNIAS. In very large and irreducible hernia, the belly becomes di- minished, after some time the muscles sink in, and there is but little room for the return of the prolapsed parts, supposing it were to be attempted. When strangulation exists, the usual method of operating is not adopted ; Mr. Cooper, Dr. Monro, and others, here follow Petit, which consists in dividing the abdominal ring without opening the sac, on account of the ad- mission of air into the peritoneal cavity being thus prevented : but when the stricture is placed at the upper part of the sac, the division of the ring can be of no service, and consequently, ought only to be performed when the rupture is of great size, and the sac not adhering to the intestine. The operation is performed in the following manner: a small opening is to be made into the tendinous covering of the sac three-fourths of an inch below the abdominal ring: then a director is to be intro- duced into the ring, and a probe pointed bistoury carried along it, with which the ring is divided : the tumour is then to be em- braced, and the parts returned into the abdomen: this opera- tion has been done several times, both by Mr. Cooper and others, and generally speaking, successfully. SMALL HERNIA NOT PROTRUDING THROUGH THE RING. Hernia is now and then so small as not to pass through the external ring, yet becomes strangulated, and a little tumour ob- servable, which, with concomitant symptoms, leads the surgeon to the seat of the disease. Here an incision must be made X

LECTUIIE XXXIII. 410 tinually discharging: the limb remains useless until anchylosis supervenes, which is caused either by the deposition of a gela- tinous substance, or an osseus one, or by a direct communica- tion between the extremities of the bones. When the ulcera- tive process commences in the joint, what are termed hectic symptoms come on, and under these circumstances the life of the patient is at stake, unless the limb is removed, when it is possible to do so: yet this is by no means had recourse to so frequently as it formerly was even within these few years ; in- deed the operation is never resorted to, unless the constitution of the patient suffers so much that his life is brought into im- minent danger by the hectic fever. When the disease has ran to its greatest height, it will mostly abate, and in the course of time anchylosis terminates the mischief, which preserves the original limb, instead of compelling the patient to use an artificial one; which is more advantageous to the patient in every respect; and it often happens, that, .when the limb is amputated, the disease attacks other joints. APP&ARANCE OF THE JOINT ON DISSECTION. If the limb of a person is dissected who has sutfered from this disease, under the skin there will be found a very large quantity of fat, and this is found, though the other parts of the body are very spare : this appearance arises ft-om a greater de- termination of blood being made to this part, in consequence of the irritation and inflammation present here. The ligaments are found very much thickened, produced by the same cause. The membrane, lining the cavity of the joint, is un- dergoing the inflammatory process, also the suppurative and ulcerative; granulations exist on some parts of it, and ulceration going on in others; so that the principal seat of the disease is in this membrane, and the ligaments are thickened from it. Next, the cartilaginous substance covering the extremities of the bones become absorbed; and lastly, the bones themselves are acted upon by the absorbent vessels; the inflammatory symptoms present, stimulating these vessels to an increased action, and not unfrequently foramina are formed in the bone by the action of these. It may be remarked here, that when

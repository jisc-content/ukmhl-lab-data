96 LECTURE VIII. was not obtained till a free opening was made through the aponeurosis, when every untoward symptom disappeared. The third species of puuctured wounds are those where nerves are affected; when these happen tetanus is produced. Though tetanus is not always arising from injuries of the nerves alone, as it will frequently be induced when wounds of tendons have occurred of a slight nature, either in the hands or feet, but mostly in the feet; this may be considered rather a medical disease, and comes with greater propriety under the province of the physician, yet, as it is a consequence of wounds, it is right to notice it here. It is divided into trismus and tetanus: trismus when confined to the muscles of the jaw and throat only; tetanus when the whole body becomes more or less affected : and this last species when the body is bent forwards, is called emprosthotonos ; when bent backwards, opisthotonos. It commences with general uneasiness and restlessness ; the suppurative discharge from the wound suddenly diminishes, and at length totally ceases; the surface becomes puffy and dried ; at first red, afterwards marbled. This phenomenon is accompanied with acute pains, which are increased by exposure to the atmospheric air, and by the slightest touch of external bodies. The pain continues to extend till the whole limb is affected; the wounded parts inflame ; the muscles are seized with convulsive twitcliings, accompanied or preceded by violent cramps ; a stiffness is felt about the neck, similar to that brought on by cold; the jaw becomes fixed; the muscles of the back are then affected, which produces opisthotonos; the muscles of the limbs next; then those of the abdomen ; these are hard, but the body is not bent equally forward by the spasms in them ; the limbs get stiff, and the countenance has a peculiar smile on it, termed the risus sardonicus; the last muscles becoming affected are the diaphragm and intercostals. The pulse is extremely quick previous to death, but it has never discovered intermission in it, vvhich would indicate spasm of the heart; cold perspirations pervade the body. The muscular irritation extends rapidly; deglutition becomes difficult, and in a short time impossible, 4

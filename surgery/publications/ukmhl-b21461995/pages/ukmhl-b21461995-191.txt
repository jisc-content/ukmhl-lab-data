LECTURE XV. 181 tumour is situated on the thigh, in the course of the femora:! artery, make strong pressure in the groin, on the artery of that side, to interrupt the flow of blood into that part; the aneu- rismal tumour, if it is one, will be immediately emptied, and sink down, and on removing the pressure, it will again suddenly regain its former size; whereas, if it is not an aneurism, the tumour will by no means be diminished. The artery some- times lies anterior to the tumour, when this happens, feel only for the sides of the tumour ; and if there is any pulsation there, it may safely be concluded to be an aneurism, and vice versa, for in the latter case the pulsation will only be found in the direction of the artery. ' Aneurisms, as far as I can trace, occur less frequently irt women than in men. They sometimes, though but very rarely, undergo a spontaneous cure, of which two instances could be stated; and where an operation may be deemed improper from certain existing circumstances, it may be agreeable and ad- visable to let the patient know this ; but otherwise it would be highly improper to inform him of it^ as prejudicing his mind against an operation from which alone he can derive any bene- fit. It is possible that if the aneurism is of that nature as to prevent an operation from its situation, still the patient's life may be considerably prolonged by a strict attention to a spare diet, as milk, broth and acidulated drinks, See, the occasional use of digitalis; in applying repellent lotions to the tumour, as ice, or vinegar and water: bleedings should be largely and re- peatedly had recourse to; recommended by Valsalva, and successfully adopted at the Hotel Dieu, Paris, by Pellatan; avoiding every stimulus or exertion, and observing perfect quiet and rest. If the tumour is small, and can be compressed, it will be prudent to have recourse to pressure by means of a pad,, com- posed of somewhat yielding materials, accurately secured on the seat of the tumour, (having previous to its application emptied the sac of its contents) and support it firmly in this situation by means of a bandage, properly applied; if this should prove unsuccessful, it will be necessary to operate. Of the old method of performing the operation.â€”Supposing o 3

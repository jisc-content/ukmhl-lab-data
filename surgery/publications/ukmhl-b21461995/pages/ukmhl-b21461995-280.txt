LECTURE XXIII. 270 and will accommodate itself to the degree of elongation ne- cessary : the hernial tumour has been seen so extremely extended as to reach the knees of the patient, and in this sac of perito- neum were contained almost all the viscera of the abdomen. I knew two gentlemen, the one. an archdeacon, the other a publican, who had enormous hernial protrusions, although not to the extent I have heard mentioned by gentlemen, and par- ticularly by Mr. Cline, sen. All the living parts are found ca- pable of increasing in size, according to the emergency of the case required—and this is the case with the peritoneum. When the sac first protrudes^ it is loosely attached^ and is ca- pable of being returned; but when hernia has existed for some time, and is become more extended, the external surface is found to adhere to the contiguous parts, so that to return the sac with the contents, is a thing wholly impracticable, unless in a very incipient state, as the adhesions are such as not to admit of its being done. In consequence of this sac, or elongation of the peritoneum being protruded through the abdominal ring, it is liable to undergo some changes—it is found to be mo»e dense, and unyielding in its structure; sometimes it is found narrower at one part than at another, and this is mostly found at the part where it is protruded from the abdomen; this is denominated the orifice, or mouth of the sac—other parts of the sac are liable to become contracted, and possess considerable density: these contractions are occasionally found to arise from the pressure of trusses on the pubes, which compresses the part so forcibly as to cause it to become thick- ened and contracted: these may form three or four of these, and frequently when the operation for hernia is performed, it is necessary to dilate them one after the other: another cir- cumstance that is frequently found in an hernial sac, is trans- verse membranous bands, which are a considerable impedi- ment to the reduction; these bands are extending from one side of the sac to the other; they are formed from the exist- ence of inflammation for some time, by which coagulable lymph is continued to be effused till the sides of the sac are united, and by extension might be elongated, and form these bands. There is a possibility of there existing more than one

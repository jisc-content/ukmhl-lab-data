319 T.ECTUIIE XXVIU. LECTURE XXVIII. INTRODUCTORY TO GONORRHGEA AND SYPHILIS. Syphilis made its first appearance in Europe in 1493 or J495. Some maintain it was first observed at the siege of Naples, or, that at all events, the followers of Columbus brought it from the West Indies; others consider it of much earlier origin, and that the Greeks and Romans, nay, even the Jews were afflicted with it. It may be reckoned one of the morbid compound poisons capable of affecting the human body constitutionally, and communicating to others the same disease. The poison itself is known but very little, but its effects are very manifest. The virus is always in, or mixed with pqg, which shews that it is secreted by an inflamed surface: it always produces a species of inflammation in those that receive it, which is different from any other, having a peculiar actioii superadded, by which the specific matter is formed after the continuance of it for some littfe time. Infection may remain, and a capability of giving, the disease to others, even when the inflammation has totally disappeared. In order that this poison should act, it must be applied in contact with a part in a state of solution, or mixture, for in vapour it does not give the dis- ease, differing in this respect from small-pox and other poisons. The seat of it is well known to be the parts of generation chiefly, from whence it may be concluded those are its principal residences, and communicated by the act of coition. Its effects on the body are two, local and universal, or constitutional: th? effects locally are immediate, the universal are consequent.

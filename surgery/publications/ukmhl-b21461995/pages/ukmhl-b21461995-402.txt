LECTURE XXXII. roller will serve the purpose of keeping a due degree of pres- sure upon the bone much better than the bandage. Fracture boxes, when properly made, answer very well for adults, but in young subjects they are seldom fixed suitable to the limb, and are not so necessary, as the bones unite so nmch sooner. CLAVICLE. When this happens, the sternal extremity of the bone is found to be higher than the other, on account of the latter being drawn down by the weight of the arm. To remedy this, and secure the ends of the bone as nearly in contact as possible, the sti- lette bandage being five or six yards in length, made of linen, must be applied over the shoulders, and passing on the back in the shape of a figure of eight: a short sling will be necessary also to support the arm in a natural position. This bone sel- dom unites in an even manner, and to effect as perfect an union as possible. Dr. Haighton has invented a bandage havhig two openings to receive the shoulders, and a strap and buckle at- tached to them to buckle upon the back. OS HUMEKI. Tvi^o rollers and two splints are required. Several turns of the roller should be made around the fractured part, when the two splints are to be placed, one on the inner, the other on the outer side of the arm, and the remainder of the roller is to be carried around these from the. top to the bottom, in order to secure them on. The splints may be made of wood or paste- board ; the latter is the best, and being soaked in water it will adapt itself to the figure of the arm, and thus better retain the bone in its position. The arm is to be supported, but not raised by a slmg, and the patient is not to be confined to his bed, as he does much belter without. BADIUS AND ULNA. In this case, the same splints and bandages are required as .when the os humeri is fractured: the yplints are to be placed .one on the outside and the other on the inside of the arm, not

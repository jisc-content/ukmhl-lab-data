89 lectuhe VII, removed, which fell into the gutter, the removed part wiped clean, replaced, and all did well. Few have gone the length of this case.—They will do pretty well for our credibility where they extend only to all-hut separated, - as innumerable instances could be adduced of such cases uniting well; but when they are carried further, in tiie present state of our knowledge, they only stagger our belief in the truth of the asserted and attested cases. Case.—A tailor's wife holding a piece of wood for her husband to cut through with a sharp cleaver, unluckily by poor snip's aiming a very straight forward blow, nearly, that is, " all- hut" separated his wife's second finger of the left hand; she came under the author's care, who suggested the propriety of attempting an union : she caught eagerly at the proposal, and this was deemed a very fair case to see the extent union could be carried to; the parts were not entirely detached, but were held together by a small piece of integument only : in a month the finger was healed. The mode of retaining parts in contact with each other when divided, are two, viz, the application of adhesive plaster, and using; sutures. When the first is made use of, it should be applied in the form of slips across the wound, taking care to leave interstices between each for the escape of any matter which may be secreted, or blood which might be effused; for if this is not done, these acting as extraneous substances, will force the lips of the wound asunder, and thus render the sup- purative process and granulations necessary to heal it. The ex- ceptions to the use of adhesive plaster to every case of incised wound are but few. In the eye-lids, cheeks, and lips sutures must be used, on account of the great mobility of these parts ; also in the scrotum, after extirpation of the testicle, &c. In wounds that are triangular, a suture had better be placed at the raised angle. When the muscles have been divided transversely, it is in general only necessary that the position of the limb should be attended to, as if it is placed in that posture by which the divided muscles can be relaxed, the edges of the wound will readily approximate ; and if a suture through 3

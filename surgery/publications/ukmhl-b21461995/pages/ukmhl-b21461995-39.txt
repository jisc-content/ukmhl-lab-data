Compound fractures also cause often but slight local effects ; but in the morning succeeding the accident, great constitutional injury will be evinced, which has been known to mislead the physician, who conceived them to be typhoid. Irritation in« the stomach is followed by loss of appetite, vomiting, &c.; the bowels at first costive, but generally conclude with diarrhoea; the secretion of bile is lessened, consequently the faeces are of a bad unhealthy colour. Vegetable poisons, such as tobacco, introduced into the intestines, produces great relaxation and debility, syncope, &c. Pressure on the brain will stop the motion of the heart to a great degree; but on the cause being removed, it again re- acts. The symptoms of constitutional irritation are pains in the head, back, and loins; the pulse becomes quick, hard, and generally full, next contracted and thready: ■ when the irri- tation is great, irregular, and often intermittent, tongue fur- red ; if the irritation is slight, white ; if considerable, yellow ; if so great as to terminate in mortification, brown, the stomach weak and rejecting its contents, bowels costive, urine high coloured, and when the irritation is ceasing, it deposits a sedi- ment. The effect on the skin is generally cold chills, succeeded by heat and profuse sweating: if slight, once in twentj'-four hours; if great, twice, and so on. The symptoms produced by contused wounds, fi-om their effects causing considerable irritation, are often mistaken for fever. The first effects of the accident are pain in the head, back, and loins, tongue white and furred; afterwards brown, and in proportion to its quick- ness in becoming brown, the violence of the irritation is to be estimated ; the mouth dry, appetite lost, and sometimes sick- ness ensues ; costiveness, which if the irritation be of any con- tinuance, changes into purging; pulse preternaturally hard, though not full; the arteries not dilating; when the irritation be- comes more violent, the pulse becomes irregular and interrupted, (intermission of pulse in old people not to be considered dan- gerous of itself, without other concurring symptoms) and some- times there is a sensation of jerking; respiration quick and laborious; urine discharged in small quantity and highly co-

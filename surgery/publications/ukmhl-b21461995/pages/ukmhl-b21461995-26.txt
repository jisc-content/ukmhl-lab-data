Scrophula and cancer are two diseases, in iheir incipient stage, very dissimilar; but, when more matured, they very closely resemble each other; and, in this point, ignorance will make it life and death to the patient. In scrophula there is no disposition to spread, so as to generate infection in the neighbouring parts; whereas, in cancer, if we leave, after operating, any of the diseased parts, we effect no real good to the patient; when a patient has a cancer in the breast, it is requisite to remove the whole gland. It is the practice of young men, who frequent the hospitals for instruction, to attend only to the greater operations in sur- gery, without paying any regard to the minor parts, and this- cannot be too much reprobated.; for it is to this lesser prac- tice they are generally and chiefly called when established in their profession, and no reasonable man ought to overlook it; the greater operations form but a small part of practice. In the profession of surgery, every thing must be learned by intense application; genius is not so necessary as in the other professions, and can do but little; it is mature judgment, com- bined with experience, which will make Surgery beneficial to our fellow creatures. When a surgeon meets with an occasional circumstance which baffles and impedes his operations, it too frequently hap- pens that he leaves his surgical pursuits, and adopts the less difficult study of physic, or retires from the profession alto- gether in disgust, without considering the cause of his dis- appointment, and rationally endeavouring to correct similar er- rors in himself and others. The practice of Surgery has been condemned as being an â€¢ inhuman profession, and devoid of sensibility : that some men, from their rough and uncouth manners and fretfulness of tem- per, may occasion such a slur, there certainly cannot be a dotibt; it is unquestionable : there is nothing, we must confess, in the practice of Surgery to soften the heart of a man whose disposition is deficient in susceptibility; but surely, on the other hand, there is nothing to render that man, before open to the feelings of humanity, callous to the sufferings of his fellow beings : and it is true, that constant exposure to the distresses

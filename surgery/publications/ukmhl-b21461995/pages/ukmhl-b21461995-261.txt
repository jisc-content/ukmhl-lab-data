251 XECTURE XXI. LECTURE XXL ON DISEASES OF THE BREAST. The breast is subject to a variety of tumours, and not con- fined, as was formerly supposed, to one, i. e. scirrhus; which I think the most frequent of all. The first that I shall commence my description with is that of the HYDATID kind, where there are a number of little bags or cysts formed. The first appearance that it presents is a tumour on the part, and occurring in people apparently of good health; unlike that of cancer in the constitution, being but little affected : it is about the size of a pea, and yielding on pressure, but elastic and returning to its former size when that pressure is removed : in this state there is but little or no pain ; it begins often in one part of the breast, and at another at some distance, so that the intermediate space is not diseased ; but this does not long continue, as the whole substance of the breast soon par- takes of it: suppuration next ensues, and a great deal of pain is now felt, and if the inflammation has long existed the tumour will burst, and a glairy fluid, or inspissated mucus mixed with a small quantity of matter will be discharged. A cyst thus opening remains in a sinuous state, and a fluid is constantly secreted: then another cyst inflames and terminates as above, and so on, from one to another: if the case was to be left to itself it would take some time before a complete sinus of the •whole took place. No ulceration is found in the parts around. It is confined entirely to the glandular substance of the breast — the axilla is never found affected, which shows that there is no absorption taking place. S

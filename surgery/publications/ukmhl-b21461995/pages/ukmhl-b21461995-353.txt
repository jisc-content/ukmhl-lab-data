LECTUKE XXX. 543 The distinguishing character between this complaint and stone in the bladder, is, that when the bladder is empty, the pa- tient is so free from pain and uneasiness that he can bear to leap, or put himself in any position, without suffering any in- convenience ; but if he exerts himself even ever so trifling, when the bladder is full, then he experiences very great pain. The sudden stop put to the flow of urine in this complaint, is riot similar in its cause to that which exists when a calculus is in the bladder, being, in the former case, caused by his own efforts from the excessive pain he suffers. There is generally a great deal of tenesmus and bearing down of the rectum in this com- plamt. Upon dissection it has been found, that the mucoHS membrane of the bladder has been highly inflamed, and iifk fungous state, having a very striking resemblance to an eye affect- ed with Egyptian ophthalmia: the bladder is much contract^ in size, and does not generally contain more than two ounces of urine if the disease is much advanced, nor more than half a piirt in its earlier stage. - If this disease arises from a stricture in the urethra, the first object must be to get rid of it, by means of the caustic bou- gie: and the use of it, under these circumstances, rather tends to lessen than increase the irritable state of the bladder: but if the disease should remain after the stricture has been destroyed and depends upon any other cause, the injection into the blad- der of a lotion composed of the tinctura opiijj; mucilag cr acaaffi^; or the extract opii, united with |iv. of muciWe will be found to have a good effect: the mode of throwing this nito the bladder, with the greatest facility, is to introduce a hollow bougie into that viscus, and then with a common syringe throw It up. When there is no bougie to be obtained to con- vey the fluid it must be passed forward, after injection with a syringe, by rubbing down the canal of the urethra, taking care that the aperture at the extremity of the penis is clo«ed° and ^so that the liquid must be forced along the passage very gently. This plan has been known to give palliative relief, ^hen every tbmg else had failed. Opium introduced into the rectum, in the form of a pill, combined with cicuta, ^vill also

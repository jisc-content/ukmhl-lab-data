153 LECTURE XIII. paralytic (paraphlegia), sometimes on one side only (hemiphle- gia): both pupils much dilated (occasionally but one, but this happens where the brain is affected only on one side, or more that side than the other): bleeding at the nose, and sometimes of the ears also; the breathing takes on that kind of sterta which accompanies apoplexy, pulse slow and laborious, and often intermittent; and this often, when the least exertion is made, will be quicker, and take on an irregularity. The sto- mach becomes affected: in fact, an instance, I believe, was never known, of an injury done to the brain, without this organ beino- more or less affected by vomiting. Soiiietimes blood is thrown up ; but thjs should not excite any alarm, as to its proceeding from internal haemorrhage, as in this case it passes from the nose into the throat. Costiveness also is an attendant symptom : there are other minor symptoms which do not merit a particular attention in this general description. The injuries of the brain are commonly divided into two states or classes: concussion and compression ; the latter being the effect either of extravasation of blood, of effusion of serum, pressure of bone, or formation of matter:—others fidd, loss of some part of the substance; and, lastly, inflainmation from an injury. ON CONCUSSION, The symptoms of concussion resemble very much those of intoxication, so much so, that if a surgeon should be called to a patient (who in consequence of having fallen down, from ex- cessive drinking, and yet received no injury), he may be led to suppose, that the symptoms indicate concussion of the brain : the first question, therefore, should be directed to ascertain the state of the patient before he fell—he appears possessed, as it were, with sound sleep, a kind of slight delirium, and some- times coma; his voluntary motions, as well as his senses, are lost apparently, but he breathes without any kind of restriction ; his pulse rather slow than otherwise, but on rousing him, or on the least exertion on his part, the difficulty of breathing, with

Id The following is Barron Larrey's simple statement of his ap' pointment as surgeon-in-chicf to the grand army, which was, in the witty but sarcastic language of Talleyrand, to take part in the " beginning of the end :" " Promising myself that repose which very active duties in a war of twenty years' duration should have secured for me, I formed the design of collecting the notes contained in the journal of my com- paigns, with the view of submitting them for publication, and thus rendering my labors profitable to younger military surgeons. This difficult task had scarcely been accomplished at the expiration of the year 1811, by the publication of three volumes of my memoirs, when we were apprised of the great preparations of the govern- ment for the purposes of war, and of the measures in progress, in- dicative of a distant expedition. My fears on this point were by no means tardily confirmed, by the reception of an order of depar- ture, accompanied by the decree of February 12th, 1812, appoint- ing me surgeon-in-chief to the grand army. I could no longer entertain my doubts respecting the opening of a new campaign." This campaign and its disastrous retreat, particularly the latter, furnished Barron Larrey with extensive opportunities of observa- tion on the effects of cold, mental depression, famine, epidemics, and the most heart-rending privations—on wounds, and the consti- tutions of men, from all parts of Europe. He states, as the result of his observations, that the dark-haired or bilious temperament from the south of Europe, endured the rigors of cold and famine much better than the light-haired lymphatic temperament of the north; and that divisions formed of French, Spanish and Italian soldiers, retained their numbers much better than those composed of Germans and Poles. His descriptions of the depressing effects of cold, in all cases in- creased by famine, with the phenomena preceding death—such as delirium, blindness, staggering and sleep—exhibit all the effects of this sedative on both man and animals. It was observed that the soldiers who were found dead in the road, invariably lay on the abdomen. When one began to congeal he would stagger; his companions would support him for a time, (he walking between- them,) until, his strength failing, he was pushed out of the ranks,

12 Among the many subjects which occupied his mind and pen, du- ring these campaigns, were the establishment of a medical school at Cairo, learned and interesting memoirs (which may be seen in his works) on the following subjects: the Egyptian Ophthalmia, which was so destructive to the eyes of the French and English soldiers ; Ancient Surgery and Medicine, as practiced at Thebes, the facts drawn chiefly from an inspection of the mummies, paint- ings, &c., of the Pyramids ; Yellow Fever, associated with gun- shot wounds ; Hepatitis, Leprosy, and Elephantiasis, wounds ; the manners and habits of the people, including marriage rites and other ceremonies ; state of Medicine and Surgery among the mod- ern Egyptians ; Climate ; the Leeches of the country, which lat- ter produced disease in the soldiers after drinking the water, often fastening themselves in the fauces, nares and throat of the patient, subjecting him to immense hajmmorrhages, inducing great irrita- tion and in some cases death. In February, 1801, he with the rest of the army returned to Mar- seilles, and thence to Paris, where he found his distinguished friend no longer a mere general of the republican forces, but cloth- ed with the dignities of the first consul. Larrey's reception by the great man was most flattering; and his friend Berthier, now trans- formed into the minister of war, transmitted to him a public testimo- nial from the first consul. A pension of fifteen hundred francs was bestowed upon his wife. The soldiers and surgeons of the repub- lic vied with each other in conferring honors on the surgeon-in- chief of the armies of Egypt and Italy; and the government, or rather Napoleon, made him first surgeon to the consular guard. " This (says this distinguished surgeon) was the happiest day of my life." All his toils and labors seemed now naturally to termi- nate, and a rational prospect was before him in the new order of things, that he should henceforth enjoy his honors and domestic fe- licities at home, in Paris—the centre of attraction at that time to the civilized world. For a time his expectations were fulfilled— he had time to collect and arrange his notes, memoirs and other writings, and have them published, forming a work of three vol- umes, under the title, after the example of the illustrious Pare, of " Memoirs of Barron Larrey."

13 These labors, pleasant, though arduous as they might ho, were not sufficient to occupy his ever active mind, for during the very next winter we find him, at the request of a large number of pupils and surgeons, delivering another course of lectures on experimen- tal surgery. He also publicly defended a thesis before the new school of medicine, at the head of which was his old friend and pre- ceptor Sabatier, on the subject of amputations, and obtained the title, being the first to receive it, of " Doctor in Surgery." His surgical memoirs came out about the same time, and were well received by the different universities throughout Europe—the re- sults of which was the bestowal of honors and titles on the gifted author. The dedication of this work was made to his friend the first consul. Dr. Larrey was now thirty-six years of age—surrounded by the brilliant court of the first consul—courted and caressed by his pro- fession—and, to the mind of a moderate man, at the height of his ambition; in his case the old adage of our profession, which says that a man must wait until his teeth are lost before he can supply them with bread, seems to have been reversed—for we find him in the meridian of life enjoying all the honors, except that of retire- ment, of old age.

The spring of 1805 opened with the campaign of Bologne, Ulm and Auslerlitz. After the first brush in these campaigns a cessation of hostilities occurred, which gave Larrey leisure to return to his family in Paris, and write out essays on Aneurism, on the spontane- ous causes of active arterial ha;mmorrhage, on the eflfects of rheu-

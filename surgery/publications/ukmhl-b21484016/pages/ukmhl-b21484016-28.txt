2 CLINICAL REMARKS ON department, and having somewhat suddenly, (on the ground-work of these dangerous opinions), commenced practice on that extended scale, which the peculiarity of their situation puts within their power. It is impossible to see so large and valuable a part of the community exposed to hazards, greater than the worst perils of the field, without feeling much anxiety. Dear as the health and welfare of soldiers must be, to those, who have not only ac- companied them in the honours and splendour of victory, but have watched over them amidst the miseries of the hospital, the surgeons of the army must not imagine, that we of the civil de- partment do not hold the interests of our soldiers as near our hearts. The army is a part of the people, withdrawn for a time and then returned to their homes; as they are now returning in crowds, which sensibly augment the numbers even of the cities, as well as every village and hamlet in the land. The surgeons, too, who have accompanied them, are now restored to their friends, to carry into practice at home, the methods on which they have, in the course of their public employment, been taught to rely ; and it does, indeed, become a mo- mentous question, whether they have not been misled into opinions, fraught with dangers of the most appalling kind. To the examination of this question I shall apply myself with the eagerness and attention which belong to sp important an occasion.

9 OF THE VENEREAL ULCER. the foul bottom of the sore ; because the granula- tions have on their points small specks of extrav^i- sated blood, which on the morrow fade and waste away. The mercury being pushed to salivation, the sore became clean, and in due time healed. VENEREAL ULCERATION OF THE GROIN. SE- COND EXAMPLE. A gentleman in the army received the infection at Malta, and travelled across Italy and France without taking mercury. This is the transcript of the note descriptive of his sore : '* There is in the groin an ulcer of the size of my hand ; the longest diameter across the upper part of the thigh. It is deep, and very irregular at bottom. There stand up from the bottom, red portions of the size of the uvula, and betwixt these there are chops and chasms of tremendous depth, considering the place of the artery. The edge of the sore is irregular, angular, and ragged ; towards the ilium it is of a dark red, the skin thin and undermined. Towards the pubes the edge is semicircular and abrupt, covered with a foul viscid secretion, through which granulations appear obscurely. The outer edge of this margin of the sore is covered with a crust of dark red secre- tion, which is concreted, and is like dried blood. The progress of the ulceration is by the fading of the granulations. At night you see a spot of ex- travasated blood, and in the morning, the promi- nence of that granulation is dull in colour and shrunk, and next day it has disappeared altogether.

We see the suffering of the patient so aggravated towards the end, that he demands the operation in circumstances that make it more than doubtful in its issue. The stone is then large, the bladder thickened, the prostate tumid, and the health ruined. On the other hand, when the health is yet unimpaired, and the stone small, the danger of failure is reduced almost to nothing, and very much overbalanced by the pain and confinement. Fifteen years ago I operated for stone with the knife, and all I have seen since of the operation with the gorget, and the experience I have had with the knife, induce me to take this opportu- nity of recommending the latter instrument.

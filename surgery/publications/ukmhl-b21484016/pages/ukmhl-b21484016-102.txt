IN DIGESTION, &C. ERRORS 76 necessary to combine opium with the oleum ricini, when there is much pain and spasm, or to add the hyoscyamus to a pill of soap and extract of colo- cynth. Superior to all, in some constitutions, is a tea spoonful or two tea spoonfuls of the balsam of copaiba taken at night. When by such means the canal is disposed to a gentle action, let the morning evacuation be assisted by a large clyster of warm water. Very often, in these condi- tions of the viscera, there is only something wrong in the diet, and the symptoms will vanish, by avoiding what harbours and is offensive. As often, we shall find it impossible to restore to the bowels their healthy action, without stirring up the liver to its office ; but this would carry us into another subject. If mistakes have been committed with instru- ments, it will be well to apply leeches to the verge of the anus, and soothe by bathing and fomenta- tions, by drinking mucilaginous decoctions, or taking occasionally of a mucilaginous electuary, or a tea spoonful of the Hoffmanns Anodyne in al- mond emulsion. Clysters of warm water, during the paroxysm, are very soothing, and go directly to the seat of the irritation. The clvster of cold water is often advantageous. The anodyne clyster of starch, or milk and tincture of opium, or the opiate supposi- tory, will naturally be suggested in the violence of paroxysm. But a regulated diet, air and exercise are here, as in most complaints, the most natural, the most obvious, and the best means of cure.

That the success of modern lithotomists is very far from being uniform—2. That our best surgeons are not uniform in their manner of ope- rating—3. That the variety of instruments, gor- gets, lithotomes, and bistouries, which are daily exhibited, declare, as distinctly as if volumes were written upon the subject, that there is a restless desire of making the operation more safe, very na- turally arising from want of success. Such is the proof I have to offer of want of uniformity in the manner of performing this ope- ration, and such, therefore, is my apology for drawing my reader^s attention to the subject; and, as we cannot presume to give the rule, we may, I hope with sufficient consistency, endeavour to explain the principles of this operation.

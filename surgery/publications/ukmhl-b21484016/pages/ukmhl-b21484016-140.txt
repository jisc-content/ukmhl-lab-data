All that 1 have seen of this species of hernia, tends to make me more alarmed for the fate of the patient, when it is strangulated, since I have found the stricture sharper, and more apt to cut or ulcerate the intestine than in other cases. If you put the finger in the neck of the sac, no one will be able to discover what degree of violence you use; but remember that the finger, bored into the neck of the sac, will crush the in- testine, already long confined and tender at that part; the consequence will not appear during the operation, yet the patient will be destroyed. If the precaution be necessary at all, it is especially applicable to the congenital hernia.

BURSTING OF THE URETHRA, &C. 49 subjects. He had some respect for surgery, but absolutely none for the physicians, and refused all assistance of medicine. Observations. Here my reader will see the distressin.^ difficul- ties of practice, arising from the irritable machine we have to work upon ; and he will readily con- clude that where operations on the bladder are to be performed, old age and a debilitated constitution reverse those expectations, which would be natural and well founded, were the patients youthful and in h^lth. The operation of puncturing the blad- der affords time for the powers to rally, since it gives a temporary relief from suffering ; but where there are other permanent sources of fever, and disturbance, as here, viz. extensive abscesses in the perineum, inflamed scrotum, and disease of the prostate gland, besides the irritation from the presence of a tube in the bladder—these in an old man with a constitution nearly worn out, will, I believe, sufficiently account for the event. The operation prolonged the patient's existence, a»d relieved him from the pain of frequent and in- effectual attempts to expel the urine. I shall present my readers with another instance of those unfortunate complications, in which, while it is necessary that the leading principle of practice be kept in view, and a certain duty be performed to the patient, we are nevertheless unable to re- jiMxve the accumulated causes of irritation.

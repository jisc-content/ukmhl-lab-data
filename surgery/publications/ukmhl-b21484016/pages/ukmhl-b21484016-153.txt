ON THE OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. 127 lior perineum. To announce how diiSerently Frere Jacques made his incision, the witnesses of his performances said he struck his knife nearer the hip. We have a better book to consult than the work of M. Merry. When we look to the skeleton and the form of the bones, we see that cutting on the hip is utter nonsense; and we know, as Garengeot informs us, that the knife entered on the inside of the ischium. To speak of the hip as the place of incision, is to put the ideas of the pupils into absolute confusion ; and here it may be as well to repeat, from the same authority, that one half of Frere Jacques's pa- tients, cut in this way, died of bleeding from the common pudic artery.

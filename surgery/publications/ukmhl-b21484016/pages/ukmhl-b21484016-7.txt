PREFACE. ^ V critics of another order it is not necessary that he should make any answer. If he shall ever be put upon his defence, he will not attempt to com- bat phantoms without name or substance; but will claim an equality with their masters, and call the magicians themselves into the circle. He is sensible, however, that nothing short of the interests of humanity can authorize such discus- sions. He has not spoken of some of his friends with all the warmth which he feels towards them : the reason is, that the traffic in praise, which once was carried on with some show of modesty, has now become so bold and barefaced a measure of con- vention, or mutual understanding, that he thinks he had no authority to bring his friends in, to share the shame of it. 34, Soho Square, 21 Marchy 1818.

CURE OF WHn*E SWELLING OF THE KNEE. 79 complicated structure of the joint. We have an example of this in the sprain of the internal lateral ligament of the knee joint, or of the deltoid liga- ment of the ankle joint. The sinovia of the joint has been supposed to be secreted by a particular glandular apparatus; but the circumstance of the same fluid being secreted into the bursae mucosae where there is no fatty appendage, and only a sac similar to the capsular membrane, proves that the capsule is the secreting surface, and is therefore with much propriety called the sinovial membrane. This secreting surface is very subject to the scrofulous inflammation, by which its appearance and texture are wholly changed. It becomes softer, duller in colour, and fleecy, which we ascertain by dissection ; and by experience, we also know, that with these changes, it acquires an exquisite sensibility, and becomes the source of extensive mischief to the joint. Thus the sheaths of the tendons around the joint are inflamed, and the tendons adhere to them; thus suppuration takes place external to the joint, from the severity of the inflammation within. The tenderness, and the inflammation of the inner surface of the joint, continued and aggravated by the perpetual motion of the surfaces, are the sources of all the evil, both of the inflammation and suppuration without, and of the ulceration of the cartilages within. There is a very familiar circumstance, and yet one not easily explained, which attends the in* flammation of the membrane of the knee joint; I

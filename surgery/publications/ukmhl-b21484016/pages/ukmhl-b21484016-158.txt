132 ON THE OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. which surgeons have contrived to make a simple matter difficult. The consequence of the staff being made small, is that the membrane of the urethra rolls upon it, and is cut with difficulty; and when the cut is made, the sides of it do not expand, to display the wound; the membrane closes again, and a second and a third wound must be attempted. Who has seen much of the opera- tion with the gorget, and has not seen the fre- quent repetition of incisions into the groove of the staff, and the frequent attempts to lodge the beak of the gorget in the groove of the staff? When we have a staff as large as the largest catheter, and the groove deep and broad, it makes this part of the operation easy: the membrane over the groove is easily struck, and when this is done, the wound opens, and is easily found again, if it should appear necessary to withdraw the knife before completing the incision into the bladder. The groove of the staff should not be carried fully to the extremity of the instrument; and this is to prevent the possibility of the assistant, who holds the staff, pushing out the end of the instrument through the incision into the mem* branous part of the urethra. This has happened in consequence of the assistant not having kept the extremity of the instrument lodged in the bladder. I have also had the groove made on the lower part of the staff. For experience, in operating with the lateral groove, taught me the inconve-

102 ON HERNIA. through the stricture, we are about to succeed in reducing the gut itself. You perceive how you may be deceived, and think you are pushing up the gut, when you are only pressing out the fluid from the sac, and making room for a further descent of thegutÂ» In both these examples of femoral hernia, the size of the portion of the gut included was so small, that I believe the hernia would not have been dis- tinguishable at all, but for the sac and its fluid contents ; and I am inclined to think that the last patient miscalculated the time of the rupture oc- curring. I do not think she took alarm until the effusion of serum made the tumour more remark- able. In the quantity of serum contained within the sac, you will perceive another reason for the diffi- culty we experience in reducing the gut without the operation with the knife. The pressure upon the tumour acts upon the gut through the medium of the surrounding fluid, and consequently, an equal pressure must be on all the circumference of the portion of the gut. Whilst, therefore, you think you are pressing with scientific precision, first down- wards, and then upwards, you are doing no such thing; you are pressing the fluid which is around the gut, and therefore on the gut generally. In- deed, I have no doubt, that sometimes the fluid preserves the gut from injury during clumsy at- tempts at reduction.

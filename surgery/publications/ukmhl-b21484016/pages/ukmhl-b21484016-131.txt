ON HERNIA^ 105 the stricture in the usual manner, introducing the bistoury upon the director, and raising it like a lever, so as to cut the stricture directly up- wards. Still the gut could not be reduced, for either a more than usual degree of effusion had been thrown out into the interstices of the coats of the intestine, or a very thick and viscid matter was contained within them. The gut retained the bottle shape, and could not with safety be forced through the neck of the sac. The neck of the sac being more freely opened, and gentle and continued pressure having somewhat diminished the size of the intestine, it was reduced with great precaution. Two pertinent questions w^ere put to me after this operation. Whence was this unusual ap- pearance of coagulated blood within the sac? and was it probable that an intestine which had suffered so much, would recover and perform its office of transmitting the contents of the canal ? As to the first query, I was of opinion, that after adhesions were formed betwixt the gut and the peritoneum, that they were torn by the attempts made to reduce the gut; and that from the torn vessels the blood had been poured out: and yet it is possible, that by the tightness of the stricture, a bloody exudation might have been forced from the turgid veins. It was an appearance for which you should be prepared. The serum which was forced out on the first incision of the true sac, was iiot such serous exudation as we are accustomed

128 ON THE OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. we have made an incision long enough, when in reality we have not. All that part of the outer cut which is above the arch of the bone, being useless, by the intervention of the bone, what remains below is too confined. Let the knife enter by the left side of the bulb, and under the arch of the bone: let it be carried down bv the side of the anus, and pass the anus one inch. This will be sufficient for the extraction of the largest stone, and long enough, and consequently low enough, for draining off the urine. While these papers were before me, I wished to ascertain this point exactly ; thinking that writers have sometimes disagreed by trusting to their re- collection. I therefore made the most accurate observation of the place of the wound, and its relation to the position of the patient in bed. This I did in a patient whom I had cut eleven days before. The urine had that day returned to the natural passage, which I thought a proof of the incision being proper. Having taken the outline of the hips, and marked very accurately the relation of the incision, both to the convexity of the hip and the opening into the bladder, I was convinced that, as the patient lay in bed, the posterior ex- tremity of the incision fell considerably behind the line, perpendicular from the cut into the blad- der : in other words, that the mouth of the wound was exactly under the opening into the bladder, and at the posterior part a little behind

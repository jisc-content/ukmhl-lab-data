These are facts which I have thought worthy of the attention of the profession ; and as the subject will no doubt be prosecuted by others, 1 hope they will not rashly dismiss those precautions whieh I have thought necessary. In these two cases the seton has had a different effect from what I expected. I thought to have seen a violent inflammation, not easily subdued, and followed by anchylosis. It has, in both in- stances, raised some considerable inflammation, and must, I think, have produced adhesion of the surfaces of the capsule to a great extent, if not through the whole surface. This has been fol- lowed by a very distinct subsiding of the inflam- mation, by the relaxation of the hamstring ten- dons, and the entire disappearance of the painful spasms ; and, as it might be expected in these cir- cumstances, the irritation on the constitution has ceased. Some other points regarding the treatment of the diseases of the joints, I shall reserve till a fu- ture opportunity.

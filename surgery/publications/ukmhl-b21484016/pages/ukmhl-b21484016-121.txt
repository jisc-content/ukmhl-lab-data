OF THE AXIS OF THE PELVIS. 9^ I have a preparation, where by the use of caustic. catheter into the bladder, the hand must be so far depressed, that the straight part of the catheter be- comes horizontal ; and the hand must be a little more or less depressed, according to the curve of the instrument. It is obvious, how the young surgeon, who has had his lessons on the dead body, lying horizontally, is deceived in this operation ; and how he believes, that he has passed the ca- theter into the bladder, perhaps, concluding that there is no water in it, when he has not passed the point of the instrument beyond the prostate gland. Let us observe how important this consideration is in the operation of lithotomy. By mistaking the position of the pelvis, there is a'miscalculation of the place of the staff ; and it has occurred, that the surgeon cutting into the groove of the staff, has let the end of the instrument start out, the point not being in the bladder! How necessary it is to attend to the position of the pelvis, as it revolves on the heads of the thigh bones, during the introductionof bougies, will be ap- parent, I think, by the dissertation which precedes this ; where I have given instances of obstruction from the prostate, which were mistaken for stricture. Indeed, I am sure, that owing to the miscalculation of the position of the os pubis, and the consequent mistake as to the length of the urethra, obstruc- tions at the neck of the bladder, of a very different nature from stricture, are daily mistaken for them, and the patient put to great and needless suffering.

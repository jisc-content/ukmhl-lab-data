In the neck of the sac of the congenital hernia, is the stricture which strangulates, and moreover it is a very sharp stricture, and very dangerous, consequently. The last of these cases sufficiently proves this dangerous character. A young man was brought into the house with a strangulated scrotal hernia, which, from the his- tory, seemed to be congenital; after some attempts by the house-surgeon, and the employment of the usual means of reduction, without success, he was put to bed. There, the young man himself conti- nued the efforts to return the intestine, and at last succeeded ; but lamentable to say, it was by forc- ing the gut against the neck of the sac, until it burst. Then to be sure it went up, but he died next day, and the contents of the intestinal canal were discovered, abroad, in the cavity of the ab- domen. The neck of the sac exhibited a dense stricture, similar to what I am about to show you; and the portion of the intestine, which had been retained by it, was ulcerated through, and had burst. There are several preparations exhibiting a similar cause of death in my collection*. In a former Report, it is shown that the intes- tine, in hernia, suffers in two ways, 1st. by stran- gulation and mortification, and 2dly, by ulceration against the sharp stricture, as an artery is ulcerated * SÂ«e Operative Surgery, Vol. I. plates I. and VI.

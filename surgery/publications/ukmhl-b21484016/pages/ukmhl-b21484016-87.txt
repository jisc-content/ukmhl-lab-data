61 PUNCTURING THE BLADDER. puncturing the bladder. But before having re- course to this (which is never to be done on light occasions;) we have much to attempt, in order to relieve the inflammation of the neck of the bladder, and to relieve the spasm of the muscles of the urethra, which have always a great share in the obstruction. We must endeavour to draw off the urine by the proper use of the bougie or the ca- theter. But all failing, the bladder being more dis- tended, so that each hour the probability of relief is diminished, the bladder is to be punctured from the rectum, and the flexible catheter passed through the canula, and kept carefully in its place for three days. It is when the bladder is quite re- lieved, that the stricture is to be removed, and the cure accomplished. S. And here I am forced to remark, that the operation of puncturing the bladder has a had character, for the same reason that the operation for hernia, or for obstruction in the larynx has, viz. imprudent delay. 3. If a man have a stricture in the urethra, and the surrounding parts be indurated, so that there is no immediate hope of removing it by the caustic or the bougie ; if, with this, there have occurred a sudden obstruction, and the bladder has risen, and has lost its action, and there remains no expecta- tion of spontaneous relief, or of ease from lesser reiÂ»edies, then I apprehend it is better to open the urethra in the perineum behind the stricture. 4, Au4 thi^k is to. hei imm^ately doae, if the

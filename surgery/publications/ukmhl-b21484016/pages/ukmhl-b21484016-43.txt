17 THE ARMY PRACTICE. tence, and suppose that I say these gentlemen have no reputation. I offered the suggestion in order to lead the regimental surgeon to consider how much it became him to be cautious in his practice, and to direct it by the general consent of the profession, when that is practicable: for as he has not imposed upon him, those checks which we have in domestic practice, so by following his un- Testrained fancy, he may commit errors from which we are saved. In these papers which I have been perusing, and which, I am striving all I can to make harmless, we find a very strong assertion made. The army surgeon, says the author, has the persons affected completely under his con- trol. He can do what he pleases with them with- out restraint, and he has them for a number of years, certain that they cannot have a change of opinion, nor act contrary to his wishes. If the writer mean fully what his words import, there is no man who has a touch of feeling in him but must wish that the case were otherwise; and to w hat reflections does it lead ? To this, in the first place, that the regimental surgeon is bound, by every consideration of honour and of duty, to act to those.men under his care as to his deare$t friend. And although none have any other con- ception of the matter, yet there is here a meaning conveyed in the hurry of composition, which I am not only willing to believe never was intended, but which I am certain the writer never contem-

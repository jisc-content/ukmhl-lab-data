ON THE OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. 119 quired, what is his rule upon this head ? If he have it in his power to select his cases, and to throw[ up those which are unfavourable, the un- broken series of his successful operations ought not to be taken as the fair average of success. We ope- rate for hernia, in the most desperate cases, with- out regard to our own reputation ; why should there be a difiPerent rule in the operation of litho- tomy ? It is a subject of regret that the character of the operation should be injured in our hands, but a more imperious duty commands us to do all. In November 1815 my opinion was requested by the Physicians of the Hospital on a distressing case of irritation of the bladder. The patient was 36 years of age ; his countenance indicated great suffering ; he was sick, often vomited ; the urine dropped away continually. He was subject to cold shivering, and at night his suffering was con- tinual. He had besides something ver}^ particular in his manner, for there was a degree of incoher- ence, through which there broke a certain face- tiousness that forced a smile in witnessijig the greatest suffering. I sounded him, and found the bladder occupied by a large rough stone. My reader must believe that every attempt was made to soothe him, and relieve the irritability, by bleeding, by the warm bath, by mucilaginous de- coctions, by opiates, by enemata, and supposito- ries. His sufferings continued, and were purely to be attributed to the presence of the stone.

OF THE AXIS OF THE PELVIS. 90 continued from the centre of the brim to the centre of the outlet, and equi-distant from all sides of the pelvis, and therefore necessarily semicircular. (See Plate 2.) In this application of the term axis of the pelvis, it becomes a very important subject; and not less so to the surgeon than to the accoucheur. The term axis may be applicable in another sense, viz. the centre or axis of revolution of the pelvis itself. The pelvis changes its position with the posture of the body, and therefore, according to the manner in which we place a patient, will it be necessary to vary the application of instru- ments. That this is a circumstance not enough attended to, and that serious mistakes arise from the neglect of it, I am prepared to show. In treating this subject, I shall call the line through the cavity of the true pelvis, the line of axis through the pelvis^ and the fixed line in the motions of the pelvis, I shall call the axis of the revolving pelvis. Let us first attend to the line carried through the cavity of the pelvis. We shall suppose that we are looking laterally upon the skeleton. (See Plate 2.) A line is to be drawn perpendicular to the brim of the pelvis. This line is to be con- tinued through the pelvis at an equal distance from the sacrum and the os pubis. It neces- sarily forms a semicircular line ; and if the lower extremity of the semicircular line be continued in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the lower

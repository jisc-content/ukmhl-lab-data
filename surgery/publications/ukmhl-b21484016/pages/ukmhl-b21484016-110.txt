84 CURE OF WHITE SWELLING OF THE KNEE. Sprain about nine years ago. At one time, the pain being very severe, he went into St. Bartholo- mew's Hospital. Here he was cupped and re- peatedly blistered ; after this, he got an ointment to rub on the joint. While in the hospital, his health suffered much, and the disease of the knee increasing, it was resolved to amputate the limb. He resisted this decision, and preferred going into the country. While there, he received benefit from warm fomentation with herbs. Some time after this, issues were formed on the sides of the knee, and they were kept open for nine months. Considerably relieved, he undertook work, but feli and hurt the diseased knee. After this, he was five weeks an out-patient of this hospital. On being admitted into the house, an issue was opened upon the anterior part of the knee, and after thirteen weeks, he returned into the country. Continuing still to suffer while in the country, and being quite , lame, and now despairing of a favourable termina- tion, he has returned for the purpose of having his limb removed. The young man's knee is swelled and puffy, and tender, the thigh and leg are considerably shrunk ; there is not much contraction, or dis- tortion, but the joint is weak, and unable to bear the slightest pressure. He is disturbed with painful spasms, which make the limb spring up from the bed, wakening him in the night, and these are frequent and painful in the day also. How much he suffers is plainly shown by his desire of losing the limb.

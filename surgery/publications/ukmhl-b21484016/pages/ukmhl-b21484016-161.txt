OK THE OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. IB5 Opening the Groove of the Staffs and cutting the Prostate Gland. The outward incisions, or the first part of the operation, being thus performed, and the staff so far disclosed, that it can be distinctly felt just before the prostate glandâ€”the point of the knife is pushed into the groove; and now the edge of the knife, being directed to the left side of the patient, the point is to be carried forward along the groove of the staff, while the hand is de- pressed. Having pushed the point of the knife an inch and a half along the deep groove of the staff, the point is to be kept steady there, resting in the groove ; and the handle of the knife is to be moved laterally, raising the cutting edge of the knife from the staff, and using it like a lever, while the point is kept still in the groove. By this means, the prostate gland is split in the same direction exactly as in the operation with the gorget. In doing this, the point of the fore-finger of the left-hand follows the motion of the knife, and when the incision is sufficient, the finger slips forward along the groove of the staff into the bladder. Here let the surgeon be careful that he fully divides the prostate gland; and if he feel ^tiy difficulty in making the wound free enough to permit the introduction of the finger into the bladder, let him lay down the scalpel, and take up

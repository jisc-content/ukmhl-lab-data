80 CURE OF WHITE SWELLING OF THE KNEE. mean the tension and rigidity of the hamstring tendons. There is no surer sign that we are failing in the treatment of the disease, than the increas- ing tension of these tendons ; there is no better token of amendment than their relaxation. Let us now consider in what manner a spon- taneous cure takes place, when the scrofulous disease of the knee joint, has advanced so far as to destroy the fine texture of the surfaces. Either the inflammation produces adhesion, and obstructs the motion, or the bones are anchylosed, or there is at least some mechanical obstruction offered to the motion of the joint by the form of the bones. When the m.otion of the joint is interrupted, a source of continual excitement is removed, and the inflammation subsides. Thus in the hip joint disease, the incessant motion incident to that joint, and the little power we have of controuling it, cause the continuance of the inflammation, until the neck of the bone becoming shorter, the trochanters touch the pelvis, and lock with it: or until the ligaments of the joint are so destroyed, that the head of the femur is permitted to leave the acetabulum. In either case, that is by the lock- ing of the processes, and the interruption to the friction, or by the separation of the inflamed sur- faces, the excitement ceases, and there is a subsidence of the inflammation. In the treatment of the disease of the knee joint, we find nothing of so much advantage as a splint of tin, adapted to the thigh and leg, which

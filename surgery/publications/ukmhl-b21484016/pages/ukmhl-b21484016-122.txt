96 OF THE AXIS OF THE PELVIS. the operator made one inch progress into the sub-= stance of the prostate gland. And I have known an instance, where the bougie was passed through the rectum from the same mistake. Indeed, such occurrences are so frequent, that there is no ac- counting for them, but by supposing that the sur- geons have forgotten that they are operating on a canal, the position of which varies by the revolv- ing of the pelvis. When we consider these principles, as exhibited in the outlines, Plate III. we see how the stone may vary its position with the change of posture. In the upright position of the body, when the os pubis inclines forward, [as h. i. fig. I.] the stone rests upon the os pubis. To reach it with the end of the sound, the point of the instrument must be made to turn short round the arch of the ossa pubis. In doing this, we feel a rub on the concave part of the staff; but by drawing the instrument a little, and still more forcibly depressing the handle, the point at length strikes the stone, and dislodges it; after which it is easily felt by the other consultants. But if we turn our attention to the position of the parts in fig. 9. and consider them in reference to the natural gravitation of the stone, we shall perceive how in sounding we may miss it, from another circumstance. For when the patient's posture is changed, and he is laid upon hjs back, the stone gravitates to the most remote part of the bladder. So that to touch jt, requires a long sound 2

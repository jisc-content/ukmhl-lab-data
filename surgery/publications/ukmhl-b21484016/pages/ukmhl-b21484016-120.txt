94 OF THE AXIS OF THE PELVIS/ and hence produces a change of the position of the contents of the pelvis. A thing not quite obvious, and yet very necessary to be attended to in opera- tions upon the urinary passage. The following observation will be more readily comprehended by looking to the outlines on Plate III. We are not made fully sensible of the great extent of the motion of the trunk on the heads of the thigh bones, until we make a section of the pelvis in the dead body, and then place the body in various positions. When it is in the position of standing, the line passing in the length of the symphisis pubis is inclining forward at an angle of 45. with the plane on which we stand. [See fig. 1. H. I.] If the body be reclined, and the palm of the hand, tied to the sole of the foot, which elevates the pelvis, and brings it into the position for lithotomy, it will be found that the pelvis revolves 45 degrees, and the line of the symphisis pubis becomes as far inclined backwards as it was for- merly in a direction forward. If we have to strike the bladder as in lithotomy, or to direct an instrument in the course of an ob- structed urethra, it requires no argument to prove, that the precision with which these operations shall be performed, will depend upon the accuracy with which the position of the os pubis, and the bladder and urethra shall have been calculated. To take an example ; if we place a patient up- right against the wall, to introduce the point of the

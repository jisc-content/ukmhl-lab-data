The patient is now put upon a course of mercury, and friction is the better method ; when the gums become affected, the sore declares a new character, its progress is interrupted, its bottom becomes clean, the abrupt edges are rounded and close, and in three weeks it is healed; but the mercury is continued until the hardness be quite gone^.

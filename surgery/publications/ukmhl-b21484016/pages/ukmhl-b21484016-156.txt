For to carry the knife with the point ranging to the same depth, fhrough all the extent of the incision, would be to hazard cutting the rectum. Let the lower extre- mity of the incision terminate one inch below the anus, and let it be made at the lower part, in a very slight degree semicircular. The incision, so far as it is now made, is deep iirider the pubes, (and there it reaches to the staff) but towards the lower end it penetrates less and less; so that betwixt the anus and the ischium, it is little iiiore than through the skin. When I see a sur- geon cutting with the face of the knife upon the perineum, instead of using it thus dagger-ways, ^6 as to strike deep, I fancy that he has forgot- feli the thickness of parts. Cutting to the depth 6t the diameter of his scalpel, is making no inci^ sion as to the object of getting into this deep space of the perineum, or of reaching the face of the prostate gland. When the surgeon has entered hi^ knife and drawn it downwards and towards him, as I have just described, the next patt of the operation is (6 undertake a nice dissefction, carrying the edge of the knife still in the sanie direction, but pass- ing in the fore-finger of the left-hand, to press down the soft and yielding parts, especially the rectum; and when a cOrd-like stricture is felt, by

136 ON THE OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. the probe-pointed bistoury. This he is to pass well onward in the groove of the staff, and again introducing the fore-finger of the left-hand, he is to raise the edge of the bistoury and complete the incision, extending it laterally; finally, the finger is pushed on betwixt the staff and the bistoury, and then the latter is to be withdrawn. I have observed that this is not a painful part of the ope- ration. There is one remark I have to offer on this part of the operation, and that attended to, I think it will be safely and easily performed. In passing in the finger into the incision of the prostate gland, let the operator take care that he does not push the bladder before him, instead of opening a passage into it. I have felt the danger of this, in operating on a child of five years old. Having done the operation with great ease on the adult, where the broader knife made way for my finger to follow, I thought of doing the same in the boy, forgetting that the parts and the knife were on a small scale ; my finger, therefore, did not pass easily into the wound of the prostate, and I felt the possi- bility of committing a great error, by pushing the bladder before the finger, and separating the prostate and neck of the bladder from the pubes.

*4 BURSTING OF THE URUTHUA, &C. REPORT. BETNO THE SEQUEL OF THAT ON BURSTING OF THE URETHRA; CONTAINING CASES OF OBSTRUC- TION FROM STONES, OR FROM INJURIES TO THE URETHRA; OR SUCH AS REQUIRED THE BLAD- DER to BE PUNCTURED. To those of my readers, who are aware of the importance of the diseases of the urinary passages, a Second Report on this subject will not be un- acceptable. They will not be startled with the dangerous character of these cases, since they must remember that I am not in the habit of noticing the common every-day occurrences, which attend strictures of the urethra, and especially when they are doing well under the ordinary prac- tice. I have taken my pen, only when I have foreseen an unfortunate termination; because, after all, it is principally from such cases that we can draw improvement. Without that authority for Our opinions, which is to be found in anato- mical examination, we are likely to form as er- roneous conjectures, as those authors of the last age, who contented themselves with talking of facts, while they were entertaining idle fancies about the urethra and its diseases. To have balanced those cases, with others of a different complexion, would have been to render my intentions suspected.

On the third day there was pain and swelling of the joint, attended with fever and headache. Leeches and the cold lotion were applied, and these symptoms subsided. This seton remained in the joint several weeks, the limb being all the time carefully extended, upon a splint placed behind the thigh and leg. There was happily such a want of symptoms after the first attack of inflammation, that the notes are very few. " Scott's condition is remarkably improved ; for- merly there was pain and an involuntary jumping of the leg, which distressed him very much. This symptom has quite left him. He expresses him- self much relieved ; he is ordered to rise and move about a little, but still to keep the splint upon the back of the knee.^' It was remarkable, that part of this longer seton also remained fixed in the joint.

The wounds not- withstanding closed, and neither pain nor starting recurred. The health was remarkably improved, and being able to walk with the help of a stick, be was discharged from the hospital.

14 ENQUIRY INTO add a case of a young gentleman from the army in France, who assures me that he has neither had syphilis nor its antidote to injure his constitution, and who has an exfoliation of the alveolar, and palatine processes of the upper jaw, Szc* Similar cases to these beicig always before us, ^re we to be influenced by the account of what has been done by the regimental surgeons of Portugal, * Out of ten cases in the Venereal Ward, as a commentary on which these observations were first thrown together, there was only one case of vvell-raarked syphilis, requiring a serious course of mercury, and such may be about the usual propor- tions; but the others were not cases of new diseases, but of disorders brought on by irregularities in practice. This was in December. In reviewing the cases in the Men's "Venereal Ward this 26th of Januaryy I have had occasion to remark to the pupils, that thirteen out of fourteen of the cases are referable to chancres improperly treated. The greater proportion have not had sufficient mercury, that is to say, the influence has not be^n sustained long enough at any one time. If the effect were to be security, more or less, in the proportion of the quantity of mercury used, they would all have been well; but tbey have been taking the remedy while their way of life has been such as to prevent its influence. This is what has brought them to their 'present condition, at the same time, that some of theai have to attribute their sufferings to the abuse and the over-charge of mercury. It would, indeed, be matter of surprise, if this valu- able medicine were to exert its influence to the destruction of so formidable a disease (as even now is presented to your eyes)> and yet, that without the disease to combat, and pushed tÂ» excess, it were to be attended with no bad effects.

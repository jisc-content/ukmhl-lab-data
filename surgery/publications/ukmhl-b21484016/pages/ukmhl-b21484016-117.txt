91 OF THE AXIS OF THE PELVIS. opening of the pelvis, it will form a right angle with the first straight line. The intention of nature, if I may so express myself, in this form and position of the pelvis, is to accommodate it to the upright position of the human bodyâ€”to support the contents of the pelvis upon the ossa pubis," and to prevent the line of gravitation falling directly through the outlet. In the delivery of the child through the woman^s pelvis, this provision produces, necessarily, a de- gree of intricacy in that process. But the practice of midwifery has certainly this advantage, that it is strictly referable to principle. And in this I am inclined to think it is before the other branches of our art; where, if it be admitted that principles are necessary, it is still with a tardy consent. The accou- cheur knows that he must mark the progress of the child's head in labour along this ideal line of the axis through the pelvis, that is, a line equally distant from the joining of the bones of the pubes and the sacrum. He knows that if he calculate its descent by its progress upon the OS pubis, he will be deceived ; for while it has by this measurement only an inch and a half to move, it is still above the brim of the pelvis. If, on the other hand, he were to calculate the pro- gress of the labour, by the descent of the head along the os sacrum, he would likewise be de- ceived, as its progress here, must be with a mo- tion, as five to two of its progress on the os pubis.

ABSCESS OF PERINEUM. substance; but, on consideration, there did not seem ground to retain this opinion. Then it was inquired, if he had hurt himself, or had got a blow upon the part ? He had not suffered in that way exactly, but then came out the true story. He was a powerful little man, and one day strid- ing over a very heavy sack of tallow, and endea- vouring to lift it, he felt something give way at the lower part of the belly. He became lame, and then followed the inflammation and suppura- tion. This man died of a dysenteric affection, on the 27th of January. The symphisis pubis was found destroyed, and the ossa pubis, near their union, carious and rough. Indeed, on each side, a portion of the bone was dead and exfoliat- ing ; a strong preternatural ligament connected the bones loosely at the upper part. There was an abscess behind the ossa pubis, and matter all around. Remark. This was an accident like what has taken place in women during delivery; when, by the impact- ing of the child's head in the pelvis, and the force of the labour pains, the anterior symphisis has given way, and the bones of the pubes have parted. When this happens, there is probably some pre- vious disease of the cartilages. The consequence is the motion and attrition of the bones, and hence a Â«uccessioa of abscesses, as in the present instance.

CURE OP WHITE SWELLING OP THE KNEE. 81 shall both prevent the motion of the joint, and the distortion of the bones. The distortion inward, is often the consequence of the patient using a crutch, from the manner in which he supports the foot by clicking it round the crutch when he stands. The tin splint will go a great way to procure an^ chylosis, as it is certain that while the motion con- tinues, there can be no union of the surfaces. If no such precaution be used in white swelling of the knee, the tibia will be retracted, and par- tially displaced; and then the distortion, and the wasting of the thigh and the leg will be, per- , haps, the cause of losing the leg. For both the parents and the surgeon argue in this manner: " True it is that the child's knee does not now threaten his life, yet the pain still rises after short intervals, and he is subject to paroxysms of fever; and he is losing the time of his education. Be- sides being so lame, that he cannot apply to his studies, or his occupation, the leg is shrunk and contracted, ^nd were it free of pain from this mo- ment, it could never be so useful as a wooden leg —therefore it is best to amputate-'' Thus the decision finally depends on the circumstance of contraction. It is therefore obvious, of how much consequence it is to prevent it, by an appar ratus applied behind the knee joint. As it appears, that the whole mischief results from the inflammation of the capsular membrane —as, in fact, you cut off the limb, because this membrane is inflamed, ought not th^ possibility VOL.

60 REVIEW OF THESE METHODS OF Oa dissection, I saw the canula projecting into the cavity of the bladder; but on withdrawing the instrument altogether, no hole was to be discovered in the bladder, but only the natural opening of the urethra. The operator had transfixed the enlarged urethra with the trochar, so that on withdrawing the stilette, no urine could flow ; but, in the act of withdrawing the canula, as soon as the extremity of it was disengaged from the opposite side of the urethra, the urine flowed into it; and when, on this, the canula was again pushed home, it passed along the urethra into the bladder. Here then was the operation of opening the posterior part of the urethra, done by chance, when the surgeon in- tended to have punctured the body of the bladder. These things could not have happened, unless the urethra had been as I have described it, large enough to admit the thumb, behind the stricture^ which is always the case when the obstruction has been of long standing. REVIEW OF THESE METHODS OF PUNCTUR- ING THE BLADDER. It may be useful to offer a few words in conclu- sion, on this subject, of puncturing the bladder: 1. If a patient have a stricture of the urethra, which gives a fair prospect of being cured, pror vided only time were afforded ; if, by any impru- dence of the patient, or by the improper inter- ference of the surgeon, the canal be obstructed, and the bladder distended, we may look forw^ard to

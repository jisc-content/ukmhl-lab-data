To this I attached a seton of six silk threads; I passed it under the tendon of the patella, and across the joint. It gave no pain but in pricking the skin. I saw the limb put in junks, before leaving the patient; I ordered eight leeches to be applied to the knee the same night, and impressed the patient with the necessity of keeping his bed, and not moving the limb in the least. I was not without anxiety for ten days; I waited for the rising inflammation, but the parts remained tranquil; only a little fulness and tender- ness of the joint about the third and fourth day marked the presence of the seton ; there would have been more, had it been drawn along under the skin instead of through the joint. My colleague in my absence cut the end of the cord short, intending to withdraw the seton ; but it was fixed in the knee, and could not be withdrawn.

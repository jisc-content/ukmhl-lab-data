OF THE AXIS OF THE PELYIS. 93 be drawn directly out, but still with a relation to the axis, and following the semicircular line. In operating with a knife, it is of much conse- quence to remember this semicircular line, since, according to the position of the staff, will the in- cision into the bladder be longer or shorter. (See Lithotomy.) The line of axis through the pelvis must be con- sidered in the operation of puncturing the bladder. Supposing that we intend reaching the bladder from the rectum, the trochar must have the curve of the axis, else it will not pass safely ; nor will the end of the canula remain free in the ca- vity of the bladder: it will press and irritate the coats. It is obvious too, that in introducing the instrument, it ought to be carried in the line of the axis, or instead of passing free into the cavity of the bladder, it may transfix the back part of the bladder. The same principle holds good in puncturing the bladder from above. The point of the stiletteshould take a new direction after it has been introduced a certain length. Having perforated the bladder, it ought then to be directed downwards in the line of the axis, which, in the circumstances requiring the operation, is always the long diameter of the bladder. I now beg my reader s attention to the axis of the revolving pelvis; to the manner in which the pelvis revolves upon the heads of the thigh bones,

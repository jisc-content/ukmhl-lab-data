92 OF THE AXIS OF THE PELVIS, It is by taking into calculation the form of the pelvis in conjunction with this line of the axis, that the accoucheur is able to ascertain the po- sition of the head by the degree of its descent. For as the rotation of the child's head is a conse- quence of the surfaces of the pelvis opposed to its descent, so is there necessarily a correspondence betwixt the degree of its progress along the line of the axis, and the rotation which the child's head has made. By attention to the axis of the pelvis, the ac- coucheur not only ascertains the progress of the labour and the position of the child^s head, but he also is enabled to proportion, and adapt his in- struments at the same time to the form of the pelvis and to that of the head. He learns by this means also, to direct his efforts for the delivery of the child, which ought always to be in the line of the axis. But let us dismiss this part of the subject, which I have touched upon, only as illustrative of what properly belongs to us. Lithotomy cannot be performed safely without regard to the line of the axis. If in using the gorget the surgeon were to carry the point straight onward, he would be particularly apt to lose the direction of the staff, and plunge n betwixt the rectum and bladder. To avoid this, he has only to remember the axis, and move his instrument in the semi- circular direction, carrying the cutting point up- wards, while the handle is moved backward. In using Frere Cosme's instrument, it is not to

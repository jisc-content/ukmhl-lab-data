107 ON HERNIA. that the sac of the congenital hernia is peculiar in this : that it is a natural process of the peritoneum, and not as in other herniae, a preternatural and for- cible protrusion of that membrane. You know that the vaginal coat of the testicle is prevented closing by the presence of the intestine, and that this mem- brane is the sac of the hernia. It may be owing to this peculiarity, that the sac of the congenital hernia, is thinner, finer, and more transparent than that of the bubonocele or scrotal hernia. It is at least important to know that this is the case. But this is not the only peculiarity of the con- genital sac. It is even of more consequence to observe, that in all these three cases, the thickness of the neck of the sac, was in remarkable contrast with the transparency of the lower part of the same membrane. In the elegant work of Mr. Cooper, to which I have formerly had occasion to refer, it is said, that the thickening of the neck of the sac is an extremely rare occurrence ; and that even where it exists, a very inconsiderable de- gree of pressure is sufficient to return the herniary contents by mere dilatation of the sac with the finger, without cutting it through, provided the surrounding parts have been properly divided. And in treating of the congenital hernia, the same author says, that the incision of the sac is not to be carried further upwards, than within an inch of the abdominal ring. He recommends, that the finger should be passed within the sac, and if the stricture be felt at the ring, the dilatation is to

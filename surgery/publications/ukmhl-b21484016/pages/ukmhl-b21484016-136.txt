110 ON HERNIA. by a ligature. It is the approach to this ulcerated state which makes the intestine so tender, and which imposes upon us the necessity of being very careful in reducing the intestine, either by the taxis, or after the operation with the knife. On the of August, an example of the congenital hernia occurred. The tumour was large, the symptoms urgent, and the necessity of operat- ing absolute. In this operation, we all perceived the peculiarity I have mentioned, the fulness and the thinness of the sac. The blood-vessels, on the sac, were larger than usual, and the colour of the intestine was seen through the membrane. On opening the sac, the intestine was found in the last degree of strangulation, and the stricture par- ticularly tight. I had difficulty in introducing a common director, and felt here, in a particular manner, what I have done on many occasions, that our instruments were too clumsy for this de- licate operation. I found the stricture to be a cord which passed across the inside of the neck of the sac, and when I cut it, the intestine was re- duced.

Several ten- dinous filaments are seen formed by condensation of the cellular membrane of the neck of the sac, and one which runs obliquely, is seen to be divided, and it was all that required to be divided in the opera- tion. I put into your hands, at the same time, a

WOUND OF THE PERINEUM. Tinct. Opii git, xv. ter in diem. Henry Sanson, aged 34.â€”Has a bruise and deep wound of the perineum. It appears that in leap- ing out of his cart, to stop his horse, he fell upon his face, and the wheel went over the top of the left thigh and haunch bone. He says, that he bled a great deal from the fundament, while they conveyed him from Edgeware, where the acci- dent happened, and since that his faeces have passed from him involuntarily, accompanied with discharge of blood. When received, he was bled, and had a dose of the laxative mixture of the house. The house surgeon reports that the catheter passes freely: but Mr. Bell, on attempting to introduce it into the bladder, failed; and it appeared that when the instrument had been supposed to go home into the bladder, it passed out of the urethra into the wound, and by the side of the rectum. When the finger was introduced into the wound, it did not reach the bottom. It is an irregular torn wound; the ramus of the os ischii is either frac- tured, or there is a deep cut in it. On withdraw- ing the finger, blood and urine escaped ; and from the smell, we suppose that the rectum njust com- municate with the wound. Pulse 100, and hard.

THE ARMY PRACTICE. 19 tate in finally committing himself, and seek to coil his meaning in sentences of more than usual ob- scurity ; from which we may hope to see him emerge, if Mr. Rose, as in duty bound, shall lend a light to extricate his brother officers from the very awkward predicament into which he has led them. One of his adherents has left a breach by which he may escape, and we hope to see him come forth as an advocate for the use of mercury, with somewhat more grace than we fear it is pos- writes, that on inspecting his regiment, he found thirty cases of venereal eruption, in consequence of what he calls the fashion- able doctrines. I can very well conceive tliis to be the case from the conversation of officers. I was consulted by a gen- tleman who had returned from France, who told me he had got a mercurial blossom; and he proceeded to assure me that seve- ral officers of his regiment had the same appearance, without entertaining any anxiety about them. This blossom was a hard chancre skinned over. Three months afterwards, this gentle- man had blotches aiid sore throat, and I ordered him a course of mercury of seven weeks. At the end of five weeks, my assistant went down to him in garrison. He was then accused of killing his patient by the other officers^, who, although in the same condition as to disease, were jolly, and had no sign of mer- cury in their faces. They had been given to understand that it was only necessary to raise the pulse ten beats in the minute ! Of the gentlemen treated in this manner, one had chancre and bubo, and the other venereal sore throat. Of these I happen to know the result. One was sent home to his friends, and went through a course of mercury; the other came up to town for the same purpose; he was put upon a regulated course of mercury, and was cured. It is humiliating to think, that in the present day such facts require to be urged anew. C 2 i

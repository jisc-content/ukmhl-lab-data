EXAMPLES 8 VENEREAL ULCER ON THE PENIS. First Report,—The penis is very much muti- lated in consequence of former chancres ; there is a sore seated on the ruins of the old one; it extends from the glans to the scrotum, along the lower part of the penis, and has destroyed the urethra. This patient has taken no mercury. Second Report,—The ulcer is making progress, notwithstanding that I have put him on a course of mercury. Third Report,—It is worse; for though stationary below, and perhaps less foul, it is eating deep by the side of the glans. Is this sore truly venereal, or is it phagedenic ? is it to be cured by pushing the mercurial course, or by a sudden and entire change of measures ? I have preferred the first, be- cause the sore is ragged on its edges, and irregular in the bottom ; because the secretion w ithin the sore is of a greenish yellow, in some places black and slimy^ and fixed to the bottom of the sore (like the slime which is attached to the bottom of running water), and the granulations project through dently influenced by his opinions, or on some expression of high approbation by older persons, of that which I am convinced is pregnant with mischief, 1 am again convinced of the necessity of offering a decided opinion on the matter.

ENQUIRY INTO this sore to skin over ; and when it is accomplished, how stands the account ? Is he well ? No, not even by the showing of these gentlemen them- selves, but subject to constitutional disease. Then comes the treatment by sudorifics, bleeding, the warm bath, and sarsaparilla, with a loss of time, from one to four or six months. The misfor4:une of all this is, that the experi- ment on the progress of a pox, requires several years to complete. And these gentlemen can give us no assurance, that a disease which announces itself by constitutional symptoms for six months continuance, is eradicated, or that it can be eradi- cated. If the same influence vv hich has puomoted this practice so extensively in the British army, do not interfere to stop it, our soldiers will be brought into a state nothing short of the unfortu- nate women who lie in the streets*. In conclusion, in an unlucky hour it has been said that the proof of a venereal sore, is its not healing without mercury. On this unadvised ex- pression, has there been built this rs^w practice for the British army. On the othf^r hand, I affirm, that with cautious intelligent surgeons, the rule has always been to take care that you do not heal the sore by your applications^ until you have ascertained its nature. * We mighl expect that theie uere records to be found, of the serious effects of similar opinions, during tlie American revolutionary war.

ANOTHER COMPLICATED CASE. S6 hole communicating with the abscesses before de- scribed. The kidney of the leftside was enlarged, and full of pus. Remarks. In this instance I relieved the patient from the obstruction of urine in the manner I have often practised. The stricture is here the cause of the obstruction : why should it not be opened, and the bladder relieved ? since it not only affords a pas- sage to the confined urine, but lays a foundation for a radical cure. This operation, when per- formed for a stricture of the urethra, (not curable by other means) and where there is no complica- tion nor destruction of parts by the extravasation of urine, is perfectly successful. I believe this man- ner of relieving the bladder would be more follow- ed, if surgeons were aware, by as many proofs as I have before me, that the membranous part of the urethra is always dilated in stricture. It has been said, " when the catheter is ob- " structed, and can by no means be forced into the bladder, what is the difficulty ? Some stric- " ture amounting almost to an obliteration of the " membranoiis part of the urethra, or an indu- " ration of the prostate gland !*' To this 1 an- swer, that it is quite a misconception: in upvi^ards of a hundred cases of obstructed urethra, examined by dissection, I have not found one where the canal was obstructed further back than that part, (naturally narrow) where the urethra is embraced

ANOTHER COMPLICATED CASE. 59 secting into the hollow of the pelvis, he struck his " trochardeep; but, upon withdrawing the stilette, " no urine flowed ; it was only when he was with- drawing the canula also that a little urine ran " out: nothing intimidated by this ill success, he struck his trochar once naore: now the urine " flowed freely. The canula was left in its place, " the urine continued to be discharged, but the " abdomen inflamed, and the man died. An " operation, essentially bad, was performed in a " manner so rude and barbarous, that a coroner^s *' inquest might have taken cognizance of the " affair. This culpable homicide,^^ &c. The operator w^as a young man of singular modesty and intelligence; he died early, much lamented. The patient's death was a consequence of the accumulation of urine for five days, and the rising of the bladder above the pubes. How long will the simple matter of fact be neglected, that a distended bladder, a bladder long irritated, is, of it- self, sufficient to destroy life! I have a perfect recollection of this operation ; the incision was made in the left side of the perineum, and the trochar struck upwards, no urine flowed on with- drawing the stilette ; but in drawing the canula, the urine began to flow before the instrument was half withdrawn from the deep wound; the operator, therefore, wisely, instead of drawing out the canula altogether, thrust it inward, and was much com- forted in seeing the urine flow in full stream from it.

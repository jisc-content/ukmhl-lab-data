93 THE ARMY PRACTICE. As to the other point of our being able to re- move a certain train of secondary symptoms with- out mercury, neither is this to be doubted. But no man can affirm what he has no means of ascer- tainingâ€”that after the prevalence of secondary symp- toms for six months, he has by such method cured the patient of that disease. In some men, and especially in old men, the disease is of very slow progress ; we see it break oat in them very long after the in- fection. We see the disease propagated to the offspring after the recollection of the attack is lost, and would almost be tempted to fail into the opinion of those, who think that the adult con- stitution may sometimes oppose the influence of the disease, while it is exercised on the foetus. Of all the statements of Mr. Hunter, none is more important in practice than this, that we can destroy the active state of the disease, and yet not the latent disease. Mercury cures secondary symptoms, and yet we cannot absolutely, and to the last degree of certainty say, that even with mercury we can cure a pox thoroughly rooted in the constitution. Now the disease is active when it is entering the constitution, when the primary symptoms are about to become secondary symptoms. Then by mercury we can assure the patient^s safety ; after- wards it is a strong probability that you shall, but it is no longer a certainty. It is this consideration, more than any other, which makes me desirous that my pupils should have a correct notion of the treatment of a chancre.

12 EXAMPLES appears as if it might. Around the edge of the ulcer, and spreading on the roof of the mouth, there is a blush of dark inflammation, without tumefac- tion, in strong contrast of colour with the foul- ness within. The ulcer is excavated, irregular, and lined with an ash-coloured slough; it appears as if the substance were dug out, leaving a deter- mined edge. Venereal Ward, 7th Aug.* The mercury has affected the gums ; the sore is already clean and diminished in extent.â€”Aug. 17. What is meant by saying that the disease has lost its violence I am at a loss to conceive, unless it is, that we become day by day more capable of throwing off the unpleasant impressions which continue to haunt the younger imagination. Is not the following description like the picture of the disease in the sixteenth century? I do not vouch for this being the pure effects of syphilis, nor dare to say how much belongs to improper treatment of the disease. * About this time a singular case occurred. A man about forty-five years of age was sent up to the Venereal Ward from the Physicians' Ward, where he had been considered as rheumatic. It was a comphcated case; for besides foulness of skin, and nodes and pains in the bones, he had a deep ulcer in the throat. Soon after he was brought up, he became paralytic, and three days after, died apoplectic. On the examination of his body, the ulcer in the throat was seen to communicate through the basilar process of the occipital bone, with an ulcer of the me- dulla oblongata; and this ulcer having made progress upwards, had opened the basilar artery.

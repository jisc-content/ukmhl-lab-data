iS8 ON THE OPERATION 01* LITHOTOMY. Now the truth must out, violence, in some manner, must be done! and the question is to be determined whether you are to employ the finger, or the forceps and the stone. The staff being still in the bladder, the operator is to stretch and enlarge the wound with his fore-finger. If he find he cannot enlarge the opening to the degree he desires, he must take the assistance of the probe-pointed bistoury, and introducing it along the finger, he is to cut such fibres as resist, but still in a lateral direction. But when the pros- tate gland has been freely cut, and the fore- finger passes easily into the bladder, and the stone is felt with the point of the finger, the chief part of the operation is performed. It will de- pend upon the position of the patient whe- ther the surgeon feels the stone or not in an adult body. The position should be such that the stone may gravitate towards the w^ound. When the wound is thus free to the finger, the forceps will be easily introduced : but if there occur any difficulty, it is quite regular to pass the blunt gorget into the wound, and to slip the forceps over it. This may be especially necessary when the coats of the bladder are thickened, and there is no space betwixt the stone and the coats of the bladder, for then it is difficult to get the forceps introduced, and still more difficult to pass a blade of the instru- ment on each side of the stone.

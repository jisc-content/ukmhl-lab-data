ON THE OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. 137 the operation of lithotomy, and that the cavity thus formed betwixt the bladder and the bone has been mistaken for the cavity of the bladder. I witnessed an operation on a child, where the small gorget being used, the surgeon never reached the stone: yet there was certainly a cavity, for the surgeon^s , fingers were passed deep, and moved freely around. The child died, complaining of great pain in the lower part of the belly. On dissec- tion, it appeared that the bladder had not been cut, but it was separated from the os pubis, and a sort of cavity was formed behind that bone, which I found in a state of suppuration. Had the staff been retained in its place, so desperate an accident could not have happened. The surgeon would have felt the staff, he would have been directed towards the neck of the bladder by it, and he would then have discovered that the neck of the bladder had not been cut: he would then have cut it, and would have extracted the stone. To any one who considers the manner in which the prostate gland embraces the urethra, it will be evident that the incision will be carried through a lesser portion of it, if it be directed obliquely up- ward, than if it be directed obliquely downward. If the knife be directed upwards, the surgeon will find that he gets more directly into the bladder, than if he cuts in a direction laterally and down- wards ; for in the latter instance, he will cut through a greater breadth of the prostate, VOL.

CURE OF WHITE SWELLING OF THE KNEE. S3 G 2 thought that I might pass a seton directly through the knee joint, in a case of white swelling, and avoid this extreme of inflammation.

But the necessity of the operation was more owing to the suppuration and caries, than to the violence of inflammation. It also occurred to me, that the violence of symptoms following the puncture of the capsule, was owing mainly to the patient continuing to exer- cise the limb after the puncture. For I have seen similar accidents, where by enjoining absolute rest, the inflammation was altogether prevented. Occupied with these views of this subject, I waited patiently for a just occasion, until a patient should present demanding amputation, as a relief from suffering, for I contemplated the possibility of the experiment hurrying on the necessity of that operation. I take the following case from the Note Book of the dresser:â€” Wm. Scotti cBtat, ^6, a bricklayer, has a diseased knee, with much surrounding swelling and pain. He attributes his present state to a

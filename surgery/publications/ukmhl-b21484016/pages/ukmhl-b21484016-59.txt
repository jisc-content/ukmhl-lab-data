RUPTURE OF THE URETHRA. 33 the urine, three times a day ; and under this plan the young man got entirely well. Remarks, In reviewing this case, where the urethra was ruptured by a blow, my reader will observe a con- sequence of the injury which is kept out of view, I may say, with singular pertinacity, viz. that the obstruction proceeds not directly from the extrava- sation, and is not owing to pressure upon the canal. It is the injury which the wound in- flicts, and the consequent disorder and loss of consent among the muscles of the perineum and neck of the bladder, which prevent the discharge of urine. In regard to the propriety of opening those tumours of extravasation, there mav be some doubt. Thus, it may be questioned, whether the effusion of blood really obstructed the bougie. But surely, when there is a tumour of blood in the perineum, and when, as here, the blood is flow- ing from the extremity of the urethra at the same time: when, therefore, there is reason to suppose that there is a breach of the urethra, we have a very sufficient reason for opening the tumour. For if the urine should escape from the urethra, and find no ready exit by the wound, it would produce all the consequences which we have wit- nessed in the former cases of extravasation. VOL.

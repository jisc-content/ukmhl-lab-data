xii EXPLAKATION OF THE PLATES. in my next Numberâ€”A Surgical Essay on the Anatomy of the Parts concerned in the lateral Operation for the Stone, by Dr., Gairdner. I shall do this both in Consideration of the intrinsic Value of the Essay, and as an Example to our Hospital and Dissecting-Room Pupils, to show them how creditably they may be employed for themselves, and how much they add to our general Stock of Knowledge by cultivating the Opportunities which are held out to them.] From a wish to represent all the Parts as distinctly as pos- sible, some of them may appear a little more defined than what is natural; but so far as I can judge, the Delineation is faithful, and without any exaggeration. A. Is the cut Edgeof the Os Pubis of the left Side, the Section being made a little to one Side of the Symphysis, in the Manner mentioned in the Essay. B. The Bulb of the Urethra. C. Cellular Substance, somewhat condensed, lying on the Surface of the Bladder, and forming what has been termed the Fascia Vesicalis. D. The Vesicula Serainalis on the left Side, which lies external- to the Fascia Vesicalis. E. The anterior Edge of the Bladder in Outline. F. The triangular Ligament of the Ossa Pubis, or Ligament of the Bulb of the Urethra. The Edge which extends from the Hook to the Os Pubis, was attached to the Ramus Pubis of the left Side, before the Section was made. G. One of the Glands of Cowper. H. The Compressor Urethrae of the left Side. I. The Fascia which invests the Extremity of the Rectum. K. The Fibres of the Levator Ani Muscle, which were attached to the left Os Pubis, passing under the Fascia of the Rectum. L. The Fascia which surrounds the Prostate Gland, and which afterwards covers the inside of the Levator Ani, and Obturator Infernus. O. The cut End of the left Corpus Cavernosum, separated from the left Crus Penis.

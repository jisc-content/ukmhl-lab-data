CASE REQUIRING THE BLADDER 40 pass a small wax bougie into the stricture; it has failed : neither has the attempt, with a smooth cat- gut bougie succeeded. He has been in great agony, and is now exhausted with continual suf- fering, and although distinct, when roused, he is fast falling into a lethargic state. The bladder is very much distended and tense, and rises to the umbilicus. It is not only to be felt, but is dis- tinctly visible, and the form is an irregnlar cone. At two o'clock the operation of puncturing the bladder, through the rectum, was performed, and the reasons given to the pupils were these:â€” . 1. The distention of the bladder is so great, that we may expect a rupture, and the discharge of urine into the cavity of the abdomen. 2. The patient is in the state that will soon be succeeded by delirium. 3. Were he now to be relieved by the discharge of a few ounces of urine, it would not be effectual; nothing can save him but so free a passage as will remove all irritation, and all occasion of painful exertion. 4. He is now nearly exhausted; further attempts, or a protracted operation, would only hasten on still more unfavourable symptoms; the puncture of the bladder, through the rectum, otfers the hope of immediate relief, without a possibility of increasing the danger. Unless he has twelve hours rest, and cessation of irritation, he will be inevita- bly lost.

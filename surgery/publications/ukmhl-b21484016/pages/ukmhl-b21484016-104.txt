78 CURE OF WHITE SWELLING OF THE KNEEÂ« of success in these cases of scrofulous diseases of the joints. This frequent recourse to amputation for diseases of the knee, and the despair so uniformly expressed in consultation on confirmed white swellings, have been with me, joined to some private circumstances, an incessant source of inquietude. It has led me to make trials of a new mode of treatment, which I shall here explain, lest it be further misunderstood than it has been already. All the parts which enter into the structure of a joint, viz. the bone, cartilage, ligament, tendon, bursa, and capsular membrane have the same constitution. They have the same low degree of vascularity ; their sensibility is of the same peculiar kind and degree; they are all prone to the same disease, scrofulous inflammation. When inflamed, all these parts degenerate from their healthy appearance, and become incapable of their office. The tendons and ligaments lose their brightness, their compactness and strength. With the change of vascular action, they become soft and yielding ; the bones are no longer sustained in proper union, and the joint is distorted or luxated. But the Membrana Capsularis (which my pupils do not confound with the capsular ligament) is the most frequent seat of inflammation in the com- mencement of scrofulous disease, arising purely from constitution ; although very often, the sprain, or injury of some particular ligament will begin the disease, and propagate it to the rest of the

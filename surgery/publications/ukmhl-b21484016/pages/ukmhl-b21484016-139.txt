113 ON HERNIA. a high state of inflammation ; the intestines, in nine- teen hours from the operation, were glued toge- ther, and firmly adhering. In the sudden and great increase of the volume of the tumour in this case, we have another proof of the thinness and elasticitv of the sac in the con-* genital hernia; so that, although rapidly stretched to a great size, by the first descent of the intestine, it increased suddenly to double the size during the effort of vomiting. Here, too, the neck of the sac was the seat of the stricture; and the ligament- ous filaments, which had formed on the neck of the peritoneal sac, required to be cut, to admit of the reduction of the intestine. Cases are useful, when they leave a conviction in the mind, that a differ- ent practice might be followed with advantage, on a recurrence of the same circumstances. Were a case, in all respects similar, to present again, I would expose the neck of the tumour, and dissect until the peritoneal sac appeared, then opening it with care, I would introduce the directory, and with the bistoury make way for the point of the little finger, and cut across the stricture in the sac. The pressure, necessary to the reduction of the intestine might be made by grasping the out- side of the tumour, instead of handling the intes- tine. This also is recommended in my Operative Surgery, I trust I have sufficiently impressed upon you the circumstance of the condensation of the perito- neum, into a ligamentous band, in the neck of the VOL.

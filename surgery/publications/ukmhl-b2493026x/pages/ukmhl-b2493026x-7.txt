P R B F A C E TO THE FOURTH EDITION. Tins flattering reception with which this work has been honoured 3 its extensive circulation, not only in this countiy, but abiond, and in the colonies ; the influence, which it may therefore be presumed to have over the judgment and practice of some thousands of surgeons in different parts of the world ; and the quantity of good, or harm, which it may thus be the means of doing to society 3 are reflections, which would not suffer its author to hesitate a moment about conscientiously doing every thing in his power for its completion and improvement. And, were not writers frequently the worst judges of their own productions, his ambition would lead him to hope, that he has not laboured in vain, and that, at all events, if he has not been able to make the book in every respect complete and satisfactory, he has succeeded in bringing together a mass of valuable information, constituting a nearer approach to a full and correct history of the Theory and Practice of Surgery, than any other previous undertaking. Throughout the book, he has avoided a blind deference to great names, knowing that experience is the only infallible authority, and, upon every proposal, whether made in ancient or modern times, he lias delivered his own sentiments with the same freedom and impartiality, which he would always court for opinions, professed by himself. One thing is certain 3 viz. that, as he is unconscious of personal dislike to any man in the profession, if he occasionally differs from his brethren wrongly, lie may be accused of ignorance, or want of judgment, but never of envy, or private animosity. His steady wish has been to offer an exposition of surgery, where right and wrong doctrines, and good and bad methods, are so contrasted, that the impression in favour of what seems best for the relief of the patient, and the credit of the surgeon, may be rendered as plain and striking as possible. And, upon all controverted and doubtful points, he has uniformly endeavoured to let cases and facts weigh more, than any speculative considerations. To numerous friends and correspondents, who did the author the honour to notify to him various suggestions for the improvement of the work, he icturns his grateful acknowledgments 3 and, wherever it has been possible for him to avail himself of these welcome intimations, the opportunity has not been neglected, and the credit of them given to the gentlemen from whom they were derived.

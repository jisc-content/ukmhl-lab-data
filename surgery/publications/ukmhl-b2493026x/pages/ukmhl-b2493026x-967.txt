RAN wn, in order to loosen the upper and lower at- | -liment of the iris; for, this membrane may be n, if there has been much previous inflamma- n, or, if direct force be. employed in withdraw- t it. The instrument always keeps its hold, firmly as the best forceps, and, with much : ire advantage, for it occupies less space, and ables the operator to make the incision in the t rnea small, oh which the correct strangulation the iris depends. In all his operations, the [ spsule of the lens has never been injured by this f itrument, which he considers another advan- i ge, and, he conceives, that it may be used rough the sclerotica, without rendering the ms opaque, as by the methods of Scarpa and hmidt.” (The latter author, however, as I ve explained in this article, did not operate *ough the sclerotica, when the lens was trans- rent.) When the cornea is transparent only its outer edge, Langenbeck sometimes per- ms excision; but, when this membrane is >aque opposite the natural pupil, he opens the rnea near the edge of the sclerotica, and, if the s will not protrude, he takes hold of its pupil- ry edge with the hook, and draws it between e lips of the wound, where he leaves it stran- dated. (See G. F. Guthrie on Artificial Jkt- l, p. 63, §c. 8 vo. Loud. 1819," also Langcn- ck’s Ncue Bill. 1 B. p. 1, 454, and 676, ■o. Hanover, 1817—19, and 2 B. p. 13 and J6, where he answers some objections made to ; instrument, by Schlagintweit.) Doubtless, one use of the failure of many operations for arti- ial pupil is one, to which Mr. Guthrie has ad- -rted, viz. the omission to keep down the sub- quent inflammation of the iris and adjacent | xtures by the timely employment of the lancet, id other antiphlogistic measures. On this sub- et, however, I need not here dwell, as the pro- •r treatment is already described in that part of e article Ophthalmy, which refers to idiopathic itis. As it is impossible for me to allot further iom at present to the consideration of all the amerous modes of forming artificial pupils, I tall conclude with a list of works, in which fur- ier information may be found.

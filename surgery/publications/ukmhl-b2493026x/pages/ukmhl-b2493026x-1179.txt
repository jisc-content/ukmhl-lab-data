VENEREAL DISEASE. 4 F r boiling water anil a proportional quantity of id. To save the expenditure of acid, I have oc- sionally warmed a portion of the bath in por- ■ lain vessels, placed near the fire, but I fear is may diminish its effects. “ It is no easy matter (continues Dr. Scott,) . give directions, with regard to the degree of : idity of the bath. I have commonly made it out as strong as very weak vinegar, trusting the taste alone. The strength should be regu- : ed by the degree of irritability of the patient's in. I may say, that although I like to know, .at it is strong enough to prick the skin a very :le, after being exposed to it from fifteen to rty minutes, yet I believe that even such an act as this is unnecessary. ■ “ The time too of remaining in the bath, in i.ler to produce the greatest effect, is a matter •doubt. I have kept the legs and feet exposed nit for half an hour or more; but, with more !i icate people, not above one half, or one third : that time. I have repeated these baths daily, even twice, or thrice a day.’’ (See Med. . | ir. Trans. Vol. 8, p. 181.) Dr. Scott adds, it.t the mere sponging the skin with nitro-mu- ' tic acid, sufficiently diluted with water, gives ee to the very same effects as bathing, and is >r>re easily adopted. Fifteen, or twenty minutes vy be employed in the sponging, though a inch less time produces very material effects. IDr. Scott has found the nitro-muriatic acid -. ticularly useful, even in this country, in that i cription of syphilis, which is termed pseudo- d dulls ; and he attributes the beneficial effects : the chlorine, which is loosely combined in this impound. (See Journal of Science and the Is, Vol. 1, p. ‘-’05—211. Lond. Med. Repos it. 1. 7, p. 59; and Med. and Chir. Trans. ' l. 8, p. 173, ct seq.) 11’he only important conclusion which I venture Iraw from Dr. Scott’s observations, is a confir- : lion of the fact of the generally' curable nature (Syphilitic diseases, without the aid of mercury, kid, I further believe, that though the nitro- riatic bath may sometimes be useful, the est way of bringing it into discredit is to resent it as applicable to all forms of syphilis, which, neither this remedy, nor even mercury If, will ever suffice. if. dc Vigo, De Arte C/tinirgica, fol.

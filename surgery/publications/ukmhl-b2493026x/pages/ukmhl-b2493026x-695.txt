Also Bupthalmos, or Ox-eye. As in other organs, drospy of the eye arises from a disproportion taking place between the action of the secern- ing arteries, by which the fluid is deposited in the part, and the action of the absorbent vessels, by which it is taken up, and returned to the cir- culation ; and, according to this principle, the disease may be supposed to depend, either upon secretion being made too rapidly, or absorption being slower, than is proportionate to the natural activity of the vessels by which the secretion of the humors of the eye is effected. According to Beer, dropsy of the eye is sel- dom entirely a local disease, but at least is gene- rally combined with an unhealthy constitution, or is a mere symptomatic effect of some other dropsical affection, anasarca, hydrocephalus, &c. Sometimes, it appears as a symptom of chlorosis. Be^r adds, that the disease may originate either from a preternatural accumulation of the aque- ous humor; from that of the vitreous humor; or from an immoderate accumulation of both these humors together. (Lehrc von den Au- genkr. Ji. 2, p. 616, Wien. 1817.) When the vitreous humor collects in this manner, it usually loses its natural consistence, and becomes thinner and more watery.

(from ocyfov, the scro- tum, and a tumor.) A hernia which has descended into the scrotum. OSTEOSARCOMA, or Osteosaucosis. (from oo-Tfov, a bone, and crepiflesh.) This term signifies the change of a bone into a sub- stance, of the consistence of flesh. Bones are sometimes converted into a soft, lardy, homo- geneous substance, resembling a cancerous gland, and it is this affection, to which Boyer thinks, that the appellation ou^ht to be confined. Callisen seems also to regard the osteosarcosis as a disorder by which the texture of the bones is converted into a fleshy or fatty substance, accompanied with a tendency to carcinoma. (System. Chirurgioe Ilodiernoc, p. 204, Vol. 2, Edit. 1800.) We are to understand Jiy osteo- sarcoma, says Boyer, an alteration of the osseous structure, in which, after more or less distention, the substance of the bone degenerates, and is transformed into a diversified mass, but, more or less analogous to that of cancer of the soft parts; while the local and general symptoms still more strikingly resemble those of the latter disease. (See Trait e dcs Mai. Chir. T. 3, p. 587.) According to this writer, all the bones are liable to such a disease; but, it has been more frequently observed in the bones of the face, those of the base of the skull, the long bones of the limbs, particularly the ossa innominata, which are perhaps oftener affected than any other bones of the body. (Op. cit. p. 588.) Foreign surgeons do not appear to entertain precisely the same ideas respecting cancer, which prevail in England: at least, they apply the term to many complaints in which there are no vestiges of a carcinomatous structure, and nu- merous diseases of an incurable nature receive abroad very indiscriminately the name of cancer. Thus, the French surgeons have not yet di- stinguished the strongly marked differences be- tween carcinoma and fungus haematodes. (See Roux, Parallele de la Chir. Angloise, ; and the article Fungus Haematodes.) Fungous diseases in the antrum expand the bones of the face, make their way out, and pre- sent a frightful specimen of disease. This change of the hones, though known to have nothing to do with cancer, (see Antrum), is considered by Boyer as a kind of osteosarcoma, proceeding from carcinomatous mischief in the neighbouring sott parts; and this he adduces as an example of his first species of• osteosarcoma, or that arising in consequence of previous disease in other parts. In the second species, the disorder commences in the bones, and the soft parts are secondarily affected. In all cases, osteosarcoma comes on with deeply seated pain, which sometimes lasts a considerable time before any swelling is manifest. Sometimes the pain becomes more and more afflicting, and of the lancinating kind, impairing the health even before there is ativ change in the form of the limb. At length, the swelling •6 N

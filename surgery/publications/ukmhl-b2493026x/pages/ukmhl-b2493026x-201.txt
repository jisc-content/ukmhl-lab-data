ANUS. 191 them (if possible) necessarily imply more than one general hollow. If this account be a true ono, It will follow, that the chirurgic treatment of this kind of case ought to be very little, if at all different from that of the preceiling; and that all that can be necessary to be done, must be to divide each of these orifices in such manner as to make one cavity of the whole. This the probe-knife will easily and expeditiously do; and when that is done, if the sore, or more properly its edges, should make a very ragged, uneven appearance, the removal of a small portion of such irregular augular parts will answer all the purposes of making room for the application of dressings, and for producing a smooth, e\ren cicatrix after the sore shall be healed. When a considerable quantity of matter has been recently let out, and the internal parts are not only in a crude, undigested state, but have not yet had time to collapse, and approach each other; the inside of such eay-ity will appear large; and if a probe be pushed with any de- gree of force, it will pass in more than one direction into the cellular membrane by the side of the rectum. But let not the unexperienced practitioner be alarmed at this, and immediately fancy, that there are so many distinct sinuses; neither let him, if he be of a more hardy dis- position, go to work immediately with his director, knife, or scissars: let him enlarge the external wound by making his incision freely; let him lay all the separate orifices open into that cavity; let him divide the intestine lengthwise by means of his finger in ano; let him dress lightly and easily; let him pay proper attention to the habit of the patient; and wait, and see what a few days, under such conduct, will produce. By this he will frequently find, that the large cavity of the abscess will become small and clean; that the induration round about will gra- dually lessen; that the probe will not pass in that manner into the cellular membrane; and consequently, that his fears of a multiplicity of sinuses were groundless. On the contrary, if the sore be crammed or dressed with irritating, or escharotic medicines, all the appearances will be different: the hardness will increase, the lips of the wound will be inverted, the cavity of the sore will remain large, crude, and foul; the discharge will be thin, gleety, and discoloured; the patient will be uneasy and feverish: and, if no new cavities are formed by the irritation of parts, and confinement of matter, yet the original one will have no opportunity of contracting itself; and may very possibly become truly fistulous. Sometimes the matter of an abscess, formed juxta anum, instead of making its way out through the skin, externally near the verge of the anus, or in the buttock, pierces through the intestine only. This is what is called a blind interval fii tula. In this case, after the discharge has been mude, the greater part of the tumefaction sub- sides, and the patient becomes easier. If this d*es not produce a cure, which sometimes, 1 ougli very seldom happens, some small degree °, lr,duration generally remains in the place w ur'~ the original tumour was ; upon pressure 1,1 t is hardness, a small discharge of matter is frequently made pei anum; and sometimes the expulsion of air from the cavity of the abscess into that of the intestine may very palpably be felt, and clearly heard; the stools, particularly, if hard, and requiring force to be expelled, are sometimes smeared with matter; and although the patient, by the bursting of the abscess, is relieved from the acute pain which the collection occasioned, yet he is seldom perfectly free from a dull kind of uneasiness, especially if he sits for any considerable length of time in one posture. The real difference between this kind of case, and that in which there is an external opening (with regard to method of cure) is very im- material ; for an external opening must be made, and then all difference ceasps. In this, as in the former, no cure can reasonably be expected, until the cavity of the abscess, and that of the rectum, are made one; and the only difference is, that in the one case we have an orifice at, or near the verge of the anus, by which we are immediately enabled to perform that necessary operation; in the other, we must make one. We come now to that state of the disease, which may truly and properly be called fistulous. This is generally defined, sinus angustus, callosus, prnfunitus: acri sunie dijjluens: or, as Dionis translates it, “ Un ulcere profond, i5f caverneux, dunt I’entrde est etroite, § le fond plus large ; avec issue d’un pus acre <4|- virulent; et accom- pugne de cullosites Various causes may produce or concur in producing such a state of the parts concerned as will constitute a fistula, in the proper sense of the word; that is, a deep, hollow sore, or sinus, all parts of which are so hardened, or so dis- eased, as to be absolutely incapable of 'being healed, while in that state; and from which a frequent, or daily discharge is made, of thin, discoloured sanies, or fluid. These are divided into two classes, viz. those which are the effect of neglect, distempered habit, or of bad management, and which may be called, without any great impropriety, local diseases; and those which are the consequence of disorders, whose origin and seat are not in the immediate sinus or fistula, but in parts more or less distant, and, which, therefore, are not local complaints. The natures and characters of these are obviously different by description; but they are still more so in their most frequent event, the former being generally curable by proper treat- ment ; the latter frequently not so by any means whatever. Under the former are reckoned all such cases as were originally mere collections of matter within the coats of the intestine rectum, or in the cellular membrane surrounding the said gut; but which, by being long neglected, grossly managed, or by happening in habits which were disordered, and for which disorders no proper remedies were administered, suffer such altera- tion, and get into such state, as to deserve the appellation ofJisluice. Under the latter, ore comprised all those cases, in which the disease lias its origin and first state in the higher and more distant parts of the pelvis, about the os sacrum, lower vertebra; of the loins, and parts adjacent thereto; and are eitlinr strumous, or the consequence of long

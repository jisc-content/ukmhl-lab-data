It is not only en- riched with the observations of numerous other writers on the disease, but contains the most approved theories and opinions, respecting many other affections of the bones, Caries, Exfolia- tions, &c. It was a great assistance to me in the composition of the foregoing article. Con- sult also Richerand Nosogr. Chir. T. 3, p. 153, <^c. Ed. 4, Paris, .1815. Dr. Alex.

The wound healed by the first ntention, and the patient recovered. 1 NIT NEPHROTOMY, (from a kidney; and rtpyu.’, to cut.) The operation of cutting a stone out of the kidney; a proceeding which, perhaps, has never been actually put in practice. In the Abregc Chronologique de I'llistoire de I France, par Mezcrai, and in the Phil. Trans. ; I for 1696, two cases of what is called nephrotomy are mentioned; hut several circumstances in the j accounts led Haller and others to conclude, that I the operation alluded to in the first work was I nothing more than the high operation for the I stone. With respect to the example in the lat- j ter work, the particulars are not detailed enough j to prove that an incision was really made into the kidney. There is no doubt that stones have often been extracted from abscesses about the re- gion of the kidney, after being touched with a probe. But, with regard to cutting into the kid- ney, the deep situation of this viscus, and the want of symptoms, by which the lodgment of a stone in it can be certainly discovered, will al- ways be strong objections to the practice. When a stone, from its size, cannot pass from the kid- ney, and excites inflammation and suppuration, no doubt, the surgeon may make an incision into the tumor, and extract the calculus. In this sense, nephrotomy is certainly a practicable J operation. Warner contends, that it can only be i practised in such circumstances, notwithstanding ; whatever may have been said by Marchetti, or j others, upon the subject. In such a case, the operation would not be attended with any greater difficulty, than the opening an abscess in any other part of the body. (See Warner's Cases in Surgerij, p. 241, Edit. 4.) NITRIC and NITROUS ACIDS. As these are medicines of considerable importance in surgery, they claim particular notice. Nitrous acid is a yellow, or orange-coloured fluid, emit- ting when exposed to the air, deep orange co- loured extremely suffocating fumes. It con- sists of nitrous gas, loosely combined with ni- tric acid and water; and the colour varies ac- cording to the proportion of nitrous gas which is present. Nitric acid is a colourless, or very pale yel- low, limpid fluid, emitting when exposed to the air, white suffocating vapours. It is highly cor- rosive, and tinges the skin yellow, the tint re- maining till the epidermis peels off. The con- stituents of nitric acid, independent of the water, which gives it the fluid form, are 25.97 azote, and 74 03 oxygen, in 100 parts. (See Thom- son's Dispensatory, p. 438, 439, Ed. 2.) Both these acids, in a diluted state, have been extensively tried, as a substitute for quicksilver in the cure of lues venerea; and really upon looking over the mass of evidence brought for- ward in proof of the power, which they seem to possess over this disease, it is at first difficult to entertain the slightest doubt of their efficacy. The cases adduced are numerous, some of them minutely detailed, the gentlemen, who have pub- lished them, men of reputation and abilities, and (what especially claims attention) these examples of successful treatment are generally allowed to j have'been syphilitic, or, at all events, complaints, the differences of which from the venereal dis- ease have not been, and could not be, specified.

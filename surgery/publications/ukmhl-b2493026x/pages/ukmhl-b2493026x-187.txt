This appears to me to be a valuable work, on account of the great many facts and interesting cases, to which it refers. I can here only mention a few things, which are noticed in it. Walther found five small calculi in the veins of the bladder. Stenzel met with a fatty tumor, as large as a lien’s egg, in the curvature of the aorta, and several smaller swellings of the same kind in the descending part of that vessel. The patient’s symptoms had been great anxiety, dif- ficulty of breathing, and palpitations. Baillie’s case of obliteration of the vena cava, and conse- quent dilatation of the vena azygos, is noticed. Baader describes an aneurism of the pulmonary artery, accompanied with a dilatation of the aorta. Bleuland mentions a varix of the vena cava, which caused a difficulty of swallowing by its pressure on the oesophagus. Sandifort saw an aneurism of the coronary vessels of the heart. The author records the case of a woman, who died in Jacob’s Hospital at Leipzig, of a scirrhous hardness of the brain. She had been for some time previously afflicted with amaurosis. After the fat had been separated from the eye-ball, se- veral oblong, Roundish prominences, equal In size to a small lentil, appeared through the sclerotica. They arose from the subjacent veins. When the optic nerve was cut through, the central artery was found dilated to the size of a piece of straw. Several vessels of the choroides were varicose, and the retina converted into a beautiful scarlet net-work. Malaearne saw aneurisms of the dura mater, as large as a pigeon’s egg, arising from several branches of the spinous artery. Sir Gil- bert Blane noticed aneurisms of both the internal carotids at the sides of the sella turcica. Varices of the pia mater and plexus choroides are also recorded. All the rest of this work merits pe- rusal. ANTHRAX, (ai0r're£, a burning coal.) See Cai b uncle. ANTIMONIAL POWDER; ruLyis anti- monialis. In all cases, where it is desirable to promote the secretions in general, and those of the kidneys, skin, and alimentary canal, in particular, it is proper to have recourse to antimonial medi- cines.

905 OPHTHALMY. ,ae augmentation of the general symptoms is ess striking ; but, in the third, the inflammation, „d the corresponding febrile symptoms soon ise to such a pitch that the possibility of pre- ervin>T the eyesight becomes very doubtful. The ontinued operation of hidden exciting causes, ;eglect, and erroneous management of the dis- use, also produce considerable differences; and, s Beer observes, it not unfrequently happens, nat a genuine idiopathic iritis, which does not ppear at first very dangerous, nor rapid in its ■regress, will suddenly change, under the unfor- .unate concurrence of the circumstances, above illuded to, into a complete inflammation of the .hole eyeball, destroying the organ in a few Jays, unless the most efficient treatment be ■peedily adopted. In the second stage, says Beer, in conjunction nth a corresponding still more manifest general ndisposition, the pain in the eye grows very ir- regular; luminous appearances flash within the jrgan, and seriously annoy the patient, especially n the dark, while the power of seeing the ex'- : :ernal light undergoes a great decrease; the redness, even in the conjunctiva, increases; and .he pupil, which hitherto has been perfectly cir- cular, becomes more or less angular. At these ingles, something of a light greyish colour may oe seen projecting behind the pupillary edge of lie iris, and on examination with a glass, plainly ippears to be a very delicate layer of coagulating ; ympli, by which, first the lesser ring of the jvea, and (if proper treatment be not expedi- :iously employed) also its greater ring, are soon rendered adherent to the anterior portion of the rapsule of the lens, (synechia posterior,) which membrane, as the disease advances, becomes more and more deprived of its transparency. Under these circumstances, it is evident, that the power of vision must daily decline, and, that : if this process of the effusion of lymph and its organization be not resisted by powerful mea - sures, the patient will soon be left just capable of faintly distinguishing the light. While the above described changes are taking place between the uvea and anterior position of the capsule, very peculiar effects are occurring in the anterior chamber; for, as the iris continues to project further towards the cornea, the latter membrane .grows less and less transparent, and the iris seems, as if concealed in a mist, at the same time, that a small, yellowish, red, round promi- nence is formed at one, or more places together, ^generally between the greater and lesser rings of the iris, and proves afterwards to be a small abscess, which ultimately bursting, pours its con- tents into the anterior chamber, and thus occa- sions a true Hypopium. For several days, the flakes ot the burst little cyst, still connected with the iris, rnay be seen floating in the aqueous humour, until they gradually disappear. When there is not merely one, but several of these lit- tle abscesses, says Beer, the greater part of the anterior chamber may be filled with matter, so that little more of the iris can be distinguished. In weak subjects, at this period of suppuration, blood mny not unfrequently be perceived in the c lumber of the eye ; a circumstance, regarded y Beer as a very unfavourable omen, in respect to t ie recovery of sight, as in such cases, por- tions ol blood and matter are apt to lie in the posterior chamber entangled in the lymph. Ac- cording to the same author, the matter in the anterior chamber is at last absorbed; the pupil, if it has been concealed, can again be seen, but it appears angular and very turbid; and in con- sequence of the layer of lymph in the posterior chamber, the eyesight is exceedingly diminished, or even reduced to the mere power of knowing light from darkness. Such, says Beer, is the course of the second stage of idiopathic iritis, when the inflammation has not extended far beyond its proper focus, and has been princi- cipally confined to the iris, corpus ciliare, the lens and its capsule, and the anterior part of the sclerotica. But, if it should spread more deeply to the vitreous humour, the retina, the membrana Ruyschiana, and the choroides, sym- ptoms of internal ophthalmy (strictly so called) then occur with great vehemence in the first stage, and, at the termination of the second, the eyesight is for ever certainly destroyed in such a degree, that not the least perception of light remains; and, even if the patient should think, that he can distinguish it, the feel is only a deception; a developement of light within the eye itself; of which, the surgeon may easily assure himself by placing the patient with his back towards the light, and asking him.to point out where it is; or by putting him directly op- posite a window, and moving the hand slowly along before his eyes; of which proceeding the patient will be quite unconscious. The effects left in the eye after such an iritis, and indicating its mischievous extensioq, are so characteristic, that, on the first inspection of the eye, no surgeon can entertain a doubt of the deeper textures of the eye having been involved in the inflammation. But, when idiopathic iritis extends rather to the external, than the deep textures of the eye, the swelled iris, as early as the end of the first stage, approaches so near the cornea, which grows less and less clear, that they seem as if they were adherent, ere the second stage has commenced. And, indeed, on the accession of this stage, they actually adhere together at every point, either directly, or with the intervention of a mass of coagulating lymph. In the first event, at the end of the second stage, the cornea forms a conical protuberance, and a total staphyloma arises; (see Staphyloma ;) but, in the second, the cornea is said not to under- go this change. On the contrary, it becomes rather flat, and on account of the layer of or- ganized lymph, which fills up the space between the cornea and iris, little of the latter membrane can be discerned, and, what can be seen, appears to have its organization entirely subverted. When idiopathic iritis in its first stage extends its effects directly over the whole eyeball, the eye becomes nearly or quite destroyed in the same manner, as in cases of violent acute ophthalmy. The causes, which give rise to idiopathic iritis, must always be such as operate directly upon the iris ; and, hence, the disorder is usually a con- sequence of injuries and wounds of the eye, pro- duced by accident, or in operations. And, says Beer, although rheumatic inflammation oi the eye, when neglected, or wrongly treated, may at length affect the iris, and adjacent textures, yet, such an iritis is but a secondary effect, derived from the pre-existing rheumatic ophthalmy. All injuries in which the weapon, or instrument, has

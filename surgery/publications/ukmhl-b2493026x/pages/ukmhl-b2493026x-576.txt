566 HEAD. the pericranium is quite separated and detached from the skull, the latter will even now be found to be somewhat altered in colour from a sound healthy bone. Of this alteration it is not very easy to convey an idea by words, but it is a very visible one, and what some very able writers have noticed. “From this time the symptoms generally ad- vance more hastily and more apparently; the fe- ver increases, the skin becomes hotter, the pulse quicker and harder, the sleep more disturbed, the anxiety and restlessness more fatiguing; and to these are generally added irregular rigors, which are not followed by any critical sweat, and which, instead of relieving the patient, add con- siderably to his sufferings. If the scalp has not been divided or removed, until the symptoms are thus far advanced, the alteration of the colour of the bone will be found to be more remarkable ; it will be found to be whiter and more dry than a healthy one; or, as Fallopius has very justly observed, it will be found to be more.like a dead bone: the sanies, or fluid, between it and the pericranium, will also, in this state, be found to be more in quantity, and the said membrane will have a more livid diseased aspect. “ In this state of matters, if the dura mater be denuded, it will be found to be detached from the inside of the cranium, to have lost its bright silver hue, and to be, as it were, smeared over with a kind of mucus, or with matter, but not with blood. Every hour after this period, all .the svmptoms are exasperated, and advance with hasty strides: the head-ach and thirst become more intense, the strength decreases, the rigors are more frequent, and at last convulsive mo- tions, attended in some with delirium, in others with paralysis, or comatose stupidity, finish the tragedy. “ If the scalp has not been divided till this point of time, and it be done now, a very offen- sive discoloured kind of fluid will be found lying on the bare cranium, whose appearance will be still more unlike to the healthy natural one; if the bone be now perforated, matter will be found between it and the dura mater, generally in con- siderable quantiLy, but different in different cases and circumstances. Sometimes- it will be in great abundance, and diffused over a very large part of the membrane; and sometimes the quan- tity will be less, and consequently the space which it occupies smaller. Sometimes it lies only on the exterior surface of the dura mater ; and" sometimes it is between it and the pia mater, or also even on the surface of the brain, or with- in the substance of it, &c. « As the inflammation and separation of the dura mater is not an immediate consequence of the violence, so neither are the symptoms imme- diate, seldom until some days have passed; the fever at first is slight, but increases gradually; as the membrane becomes more and more dis- eased, all the febrile symptoms are heightened ; the formation of matter occasions rigors, fre- quent and irregular, until such a quantity is col- lected, as brings on delirium, spasm, and death.” Hitherto Mr. Pott has been describing this disease as unaccompanied with any other, not even with any external mark of injuiy, except perhaps a trifling bruise of the scalp ; “ Let us now, (says this eminent surgeon ) suppose the scalp to be wounded at the time of the accident, by whatever gave the contusion; or let us sup- pose, that the immediate symptoms having been alarming, a wound had been made, in order to examine the skull. “ In this ease, the wound will for some lit- tle time have the same appearance as a mere simple wound of this part, unattended with other mischief, would have; it will, like that, at first discharge a thin sanies, or gleet, and then begin to suppurate; it will digest, begin to iucarn, and look perfectly well; but, after a few days, all these favourable appearances will vanish ; the sore will lose its florid complexion, and granu- lated surface; will become pale, glassy, and flabby ; instead of good matter, it will discharge only a thin discoloured sanies; the lint with which it is dressed, instead of coming off easily (as in a kindly suppurating sore) will stick to all parts of it; and the pericranium, instead of ad- hering firmly to the bone, will separate from it, all round, to some distance from the edges “ This alteration in the face and circumstances of the sore, is produced merely by the diseased state of the parts underneath the skull; which is a circumstance of great importance, in support of the doctrine advanced ; and is demonstrably proved, by observing that this diseased aspect of the sore, and this spontaneous separation of the pericranium, are always confined to that part which covers the altered or injured portion of the dura mater, and do not at all affect the rest of the scalp; nay, if it lias by accident been wounded in any other part, or a portion has j been removed from any part where no injury has been done to the dura mater, no such separation ■ will happen, the detachment above will always correspond to that below, and be found no where else. “The first appearance .of alteration in the wound immediately succeeds the febrile attack ; and as the febrile symptoms increase, the sore becomes worse and worse, that is, degenerates more and more from a healthy, kindly aspect. “ Through the whole time, from the first attack of the fever, to the last and fatal period an at- ■ tenlive observer will remark the gradual altera- tion of the colour of the bone, if it be bare. At j first it will be found to be whiter, and more dry,. than the natural one ; and as the symptoms in- • crease, and either matter is collected, or the dura i mater becomes sloughy, the bone ini lines more i and more to a kind of purulent hue, or whitish j vellow ; and it may also be worth while in this t place to remark, that if the blow was on or very l near to a suture, and the subject young, the said ( suture will often separate in such a manner as to | let through it a loose, painful, ill-natured fun- j gus; at which time also, it is no uncommon j thing for the patient’s head and face to be at- tacked with an erysipelas. “ In those cases, in which the scalp is veiy j little injured by the bruise, and in which there is ( no wound, nor any immediate alarming syni-» ptoms or appearances, the patient feels little or jj no inconvenience, and seldom makes any com- ^ plaint, until some few days are past. At the I end of this uncertain time, he is generally *l*1 tacked by the symptoms already recited; these l

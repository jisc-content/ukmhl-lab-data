NECROSIS. 849 ! took place, if the sequestrum presented itself | equally well there, because, by proceeding in this manner, the surgeon might discover, that the I t]ead fragment could be taken out, without so great a destruction of bone, as is caused in the other mode; and, if this were not to be the case, no harm is done, as the necessary removal of I bone can be continued. When the bone, which includes the seques- trum, is a new production, and the operation is j .jot too long deferred, the soft state of the bone | will enable the operator to perform the needful j excisions with the bistoury alone. When the sides of the cavity, in the original bone, are thin, fragile, and pierced with numer- ous holes, the surgeon can break away a suf- ficient portion with a pair of forceps. When several sinuses exist in the bone, each may be dilated, in the manner which seems most advantageous. Sufficient openings having been made into the cavities including the sequestra, the next object is to extract these dead portions of bone. In ac- complishing this part of the operation, Weid- mann particularly advises two things; first, that no piece of the sequestrum be left behind; se- condly, that no injury be done to the membrane, which lines the cavity, in which the dead bone is lodged. This author observes, that there are examples, in which the vicinity of certain parts impedes the surgeon from making an opening iri the bone, large enough for the extraction of a voluminous sequestrum in an entire state. In this circum- stance, he recommends the sequestrum to be broken into pieces by any convenient means, and the fragments to be separately removed. Weidmann has recorded an extremely inte- resting case to prove how much may sometimes be effected by taking away the sequestrum. A man, 34 years of age, who had an internal necro- sis of the tibia, with abscesses and oedema of the whole limb, and who was reduced to the lowest ebb of weakness, was put under this excellent surgeon’s care. A perforation was made with a trephine in the upper head of the tibia; but, this openiug not proving ample enough, it was en- larged with a small saw, and a gouge and mal- let. The sequestrum was then extracted. The patient’s state afterwards gradually improved, and in nine months he was completely well. It is not to be dissembled, however, that cases do exist, in which amputation affords the only chance of saving the patient’s life. In fact, it sometimes happens, that the cavities, in which the sequestra are contained, communicate with those of the neighbouring joints, which then be- ' come filled with matter, and caries attacks part of the bones, to which the necrosis does not ex- tend. On some occasions, the dead pieces of bone are very numerous, and each has a separate cavity; while, in other instances, the sequestra lie so deeply, that a passage for their extraction cannot be prudently attempted. Sometimes, •'ilso, a necrosis is complicated with another dis- case in its vicinity. Lastly, such may be the reduced state of the patient’s health, and the par- ticular condition of the necrosis itself, that the constitution cannot hold out during the whole time, which would be requisite for the detach- ment of the sequestrum. Under circumstances like these, amputation is necessary, and ought not to be delayed.

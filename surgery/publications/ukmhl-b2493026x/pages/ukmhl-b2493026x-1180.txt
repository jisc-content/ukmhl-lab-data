Formerly, the affection of the limbs was gene- rally called a palsy, and treated as a paralytic affection; to which it is in almost every respect perfectly unlike In the true paralysis (says Mr. Pott', from whatever cause, the muscles of the affected limb are soft, flabby, unresisting, and incapable of being put into even a tonic state; the limb itself may be placed in almost any position, or pos- ture; if it he lifted up, and then let go, it falls down, and it is not in the power of the patient to prevent, or even to retard, its fall; the joints are perfectly and easily moveable in any direction; if the affection be of the lower limbs, neither hips, knees, nor ankles, have any degree of ri- gidity, or stiffness; but permit the limb to be turned, or twisted, in almost any manner.

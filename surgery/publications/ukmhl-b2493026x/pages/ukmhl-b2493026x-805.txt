See VENEREAL DISEASE. LUMBAR ABSCESS. Psoas Abscess. By these terms are understood chronic col- lections of matter, which form in the cellular substance of the loins, behind the peritonaeum, and descend in the course of the psoas muscle. Patients, in the incipient stage oi the disease, cannot walk so well as usual; they feel a degree of uneasiness about the lumbar region; but in general, there has been no acute pain, even when the abscess lias acquired such a size as to form a large tumor, protruding externally. In short, the psoas abscess is the best instance, which can possibly be adduced, in order to illus- trate the nature of those collections of matter, which are called chronic, and which form in an insidious manner, without serious pain, or any other attendant of acute inflammation.

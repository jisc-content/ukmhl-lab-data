The proportion of females, who have un- dergone the operation, is to that of males, as 58 to 1000, or about 1 to 17 ; that the mortality from the operation in children was only about 1 in 18; while, in adults, it was 4 in 19, or nearly quadruple. According to Mr. Smith, the mortality from lithotomy at the Bristol Infirmary, has been in the following proportions: Age. 10 years of age and under, Between 10 and 20 20 - Rate of Mor- tality.

But, at St. Bartholomew’s, the proportion of deaths in children, during the 20 years that I frequently attended operations for stone there, was very great. In the Bristol Infirmary, the risk in children seems to have been about equal to what it has been in adults. In all calculations of this kind, however, it is to be recollected, that as ope- rations for the stone are done, not only by sur- geons of various degrees of skill, but in different ways, and even with instruments of great diver- sity, such computations do not give the fair average of any one method of operating. Now, where the patients are equally favour- able, but the results of any given number of operations on them are considerably different, the skill of the surgeons, the particular methods of operating pursued, the kinds of instruments used, the general healthiness of the hospital itself, and the treatment after the patients are put to bed, are considerations, by which questions, apparently inexplicable, might sometimes be solved. From the year 1772 to 1S1G, the Norwich Hospital received 18,859 patients of all kinds, making an average of 428 annual admissions; and Dr. Marcet observes, that the proportion of 506 operations of lithotomy, out of Hi,859 patients, which corresponds to about 1 in 38, exceeds, in an astonishing degree, that obtained from any of the other public institutions, whose records he examined. Next to the records of the Norwich Hospital, Dr. Marcet derived the most distinct information of this kind from Cheselden, who mentions in his work on anatomy, that, during the course of his public practice in St. Thomas’s Hospital, a period of about 20 years, he had performed the operation of the stone 213 times, and lost only 20 patients. This was about 2 cases in 21, which is much less than the common average. In St. Thomas’s Hospital, during the last ten years, the operation of lithotomy seems to have been done, on an average, 11 times in each two years; and 1 case of stone has occurred in each 528 patients admitted. In St. Bartholomew’s, lithotomy was per- formed 56 times in the years 1812, is 13, 1814, 1815, and 1816. The annual average about 11, or i in each 340 patients of all descrip- tions. In Guy’s Hospital, lithotomy has been per- formed, on an average, about 9 or 10 times an- nually, during the last 20, or 30 years. The proportion of calculous patients there is aiso The following table is also from Mr. Smith’s paper, and refers to the Leeds Hospital. (See Med. Chir. Trans. Vol. 10.)

Dr. Marcel’s inquiries incline him to think, that, on the whole, lithotomy in the London Hospitals, for some jrears, has been gradually becoming less frequent; and this, he conceives, may be owing, partly to a real reduction in the frequency of the stone, from some alteration in the diet, or habits of the people; partly to the use of appropriate medicines ; and partly to the circumstance of calculous patients not resorting so exclusively, as was formerly the case, to the great London hospitals for the operation.

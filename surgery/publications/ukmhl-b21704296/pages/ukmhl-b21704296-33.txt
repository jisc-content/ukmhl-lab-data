21 Tracheotomy. In order to accomplish this the cutaneous wound over the wing of the atlas must be prolonged below it. After detach- ing the posterior border of the parotid gland the operator searches in the loose areolar tissue with the index finger of the left hand for the vascular angle which is formed by the occipital, internal carotid and external carotid arteries which may be detected .by pulsation—the same is located at a depth of somewhere from 8 to io cm. Place the volar surface of the finger in the vascular angle and push a sharp scalpel along the dorsal surface of the finger to the pouch which here becomes opened on its posterior lateral surface. This method has the advantage over Chabert’s that for the removal of hard contents (chondroid) the opening can be readily dilated, even to such an extent that the entire hand can be passed into the air sac and the opening of the Eustachian tube be explored. TRACHEOTOMY. Fig. io. Instruments. Razor, scissors, convex scalpel, tenacula, tenaculum and ligation forceps, trachea tube and suture material. Technique. In the superior third of the neck in the region of the fourth to the sixth tracheal ring shave and disinfect the skin on the anterior surface of the neck to the extent of io cm. long by 5 cm. wide. The operation can generally be performed upon the standing animal with the head extended. In lateral decubitus of the horse the operation is carried out with greater difficulty. The operator stands before the right, an assistant before the left shoulder of the horse. On the shaved area the operator and his assistant takes up a fold of skin 3 to 4 cm. high, transverse to the Jong axis of trachea, and divides the same by an incision. The 6 to 8 cm. long skin wound then lies in the median line of the anterior face of the neck. After the skin muscle is cut

Preface to English Edition. VI (staphylotomy.) Merillat’s operation for "roaring” (arytenoidrraphy) and our own operations of trifacial neurectomy (for involuntary shaking of the head), repulsion of molars, irrigation of the trachea, caudal myotomy (for curved tail), caudal myectomy (for gripping of the reins), and vaginal ovariectomy. In order to keep the volume of the work within bounds, we have omitted, not without regret, Dr. Pfeiffer’s extirpa- tion of the submaxillary lymph glands, subcutaneous caudal myotomy (nicking), and castration by torsion. The chap- ters and illustrations on trephining have been greatly modi- fied, and we have occasionally introduced suggestions in [ ]. Most of the illustrations were supplied by Mr. Richard Schoetz, Berlin, from Dr. Pfeiffer’s Operations-Cursus, the in- strument figures were provided by John Reynders & Co., the remainder are from original drawings by Dr. E. Merillat, and Mr. C. F. Flocken, veterinary student : the chapter on Staphylotomy was contributed by Dr. M. H. McKillip, and that on Arytenoidrraphy by Dr. L. A. Merillat, to each of whom our indebtedness is heartily acknowledged. W. L. WILLIAMS. Cornell University, /goo.

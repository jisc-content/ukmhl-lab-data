35 CEsophagotorny. oesophagus lies ou the left side of the trachea in the lower half of the neck. When the oesophagus is empty the opera- tion is performed in the lower third of the neck. An incision io cm. long through the skin and skin muscle is made be- tween the anterior border of the mastoido-humeralis muscle and jugular vein. With one finger each of the left and right hand divide the loose connective tissue down to the oesopha- gus, which lies between the left scalenus muscle, trachea and the jugular vein. Along the supero-external border of the trachea runs the carotid accompanied dorsally by the vagus and sympathetic and ventrally by the recurrent nerves. The oesophagus feels like a round muscle within which one can feel a firmer cord (mucous membrane), and has a pale red color. CEsophagus and trachea are surrounded by the deep fascia of the neck. Pass one finger around the oesophagus from behind, draw it away from the trachea, force through the deep fascia of the neck and draw the oesophagus out through the external wound. After making an incision through the muscle and mucous membrane introduce a probe pointed scalpel or a scissors blade into the lumen of the oesophagus and split its wall. The mucous membrane is white and lies in thick longitudinal folds. When there is a foreign body in the oesophagus the operation is performed at the point where it is lodged in the manner described and the oesophagus is opened barely enough to permit of the removal of the foreign body. In diverticuli of the oesopha- gus an elliptical piece of the mucous membrane which has been overstretched is cut out. The oesophageal wound is closed by a laminated suture, that is, the mucous membrane is united by means of an intestinal suture and the muscular wall sutured over this. The skin and muscular wound may either be left open or closed with the Bayer suture and band- aged, with a drainage tube in the lower angle of the wound.

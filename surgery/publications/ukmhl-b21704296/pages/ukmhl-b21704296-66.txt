OPERATIONS ON THE EXTREMITIES. TENOTOMY OF THE FLEXOR PEDIS TENDON. Fig. 27. Instruments. Razor, scissors, sharp tenotome, bandage material. Techfiique. Tenotomy is generally performed on the ten- don of the deep flexor of the foot or perforans, seldom on the superficial flexor or flexor of the os coronse of the ante- rior foot. The horse is laid on that side upon which the affected foot is located and the member to be operated upon is bound upon a narrow board or extension splint of suffi- cient strength to retain the foot in complete extension. The median side of the foot is upward, the extending splint underneath. [With the operating table the extension splint is uncalled for.] On the median side at the middle of the metacarpus the skin is shaved and disinfected over the ten- don of the flexor pedis. The left hand grasps the meta- carpus from above and behind in such a manner that the thumb rests upon the median or upper surface of the meta- carpus, the index and second fingers on the lateral or under side of the flexor pedis tendon. While the left thumb pushes the skin toward the metacarpal bone, that is, for- ward, a sharp pointed tenotome held perpendicularly in the right hand is introduced with the cutting edge toward the hoof through the skin, subcutem and anti brachial fascia down to the flexor pedis tendon. Immediately on the ante- rior border of the tendon insert the tenotome so far that the point of it can be felt on the lateral or outer side through the skin with the left hand. The cutting edge],of the knife is then turned against the tendon of the flexor pedis, that is, it is directed backward, the fore foot is ex- tended by an assistant by means of a rope bound around the

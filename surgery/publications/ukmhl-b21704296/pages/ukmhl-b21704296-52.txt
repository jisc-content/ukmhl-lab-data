Subcutaneous Caudal Myotomy. 40 default of these, control bj' means of twitch and sideline. Cleanse and disinfect the tail and have it sharply bent by an assistant in the opposite direction to the curvature. Locate the longitudinal furrow between the levator and depressor muscles and at the lower margin of the levator just above v, Fig. 19, insert the tenotome at the most promi- nent part of curvation, the incision being parallel to the muscular fibers, and push the tenotome entirely through the muscle to the vertebra, then turning the cutting edge up- wards, at the same time advancing the point of the tenotome toward the median line, sever the entire muscle. The superior lateral caudal artery s, Fig. 19, bleeds profusely if severed, and wounding of it may usually be avoided by with- drawing the tenotome a trifle in passing that point. Wound- ing the skin over the muscular incision is avoided by placing the thumb of the left hand over the line of incision so the knife will be recognized as soon as the muscle and caudal fascia are cut through. Remove the knife in the same man- ner as introduced. Release the horse and have him trotted again. If the operation is sufficient the tail should curve in about the same degree as before, -but in the opposite direction. If this has not been attained examine carefully and sever any remaining bundles of muscle, and this not sufficing repeat the operation as before at another point 5 or 6 cm. above or below the first, severing the muscle again. Or if the depressor appears implicated, sever it in a similar manner. In extreme cases the entire lateral half of muscles, tendons and aponeurosis may be severed. Apply an anti- septic pad to the wound and retain it by a moderately firm bandage, which serves at once as an occlusive dressing and effective hemostatic. Remove bandage in 24 hours.

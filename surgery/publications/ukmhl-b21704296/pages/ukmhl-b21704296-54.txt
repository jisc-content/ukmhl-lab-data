42 Amputation of the Tail. dilate the incision with tenacula while the operator dissects the depressor longus muscle from the adjacent tissues at either side when it is severed by a transverse incision close against the ligature and the entire muscle dissected away down to the lower end of the wound and there excised. The small depressor brevis, lying on the median side of the longus, should not be removed, thus preserving a limited de- pressor power. Repeat the operation on the opposite de- pressor. Make two elongated tampons of absorbent cotton, of the size and form of the muscles removed, saturate these in i-iooo sublimate solution, insert neatly in the wounds and apply a moderately firm bandage as closely as possible to the elastic ligature. Remove the ligature, upon which hemorrhage ensues, which is to be controlled by the appli- cation of a second bandage extending higher up on the tail over the previous location of the elastic ligature. Remove bandage in 24 hrs. wash the parts and saturate the tampons again with 1-1000 sublimate and apply a clean bandage, allow it to remain for another 24 hrs. remove bandage and tampons and treat as an open wound. AMPUTATION OF THE TAIL. Fig. 19 and 21. Instruments. Docking shears, ring cautery iron. Technique. The operation is carried out on the standing animal with the aid of the twitch and one fore foot held up or side line applied to the hind feet. The point of amputa- tion is determined by the location of the disease or the wishes of the owner. At this point the hair is parted around the tail, turned upwards and bandaged to the root of the tail with a compression bandage (not a cord) which at the same time serves to make the operation bloodless. Then beneath the part clip the hair away for a space of 3 to 4 cm. around the tail, have an assistant hold the tail liori-

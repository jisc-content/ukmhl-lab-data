64 Neurectomy of the Median Nerve. square. In the center of this area at the anterior border of the flexor tendon, with the scalpel held perpendicular to the skin, make an incision from above downwards a distance of from 2 to 3 cm., cutting cleanly through the skin and sub- cutaneous fascia down upon the nerve. The incision is favored by tensing the skin between the thumb and index finger of the left hand, but care should be taken to not dis- place it backwards or forwards. Dilate the wound by pres- sure with the thumb and index finger or otherwise and care- fully incise longitudinally the fibrous sheath enveloping the nerve and artery. Pass an aneurism needle beneath the nerve, and follow with a second aneurism needle immediately beside the first. Draw the two apart, one toward the toe, the other toward the fetlock, and separate thereby the nerve from the surrounding tissues. Remove one aneurism needle, insert the probe pointed scalpel beneath the nerve, and di- vide it at the upper angle of the wound and excise a section of nerve 3 cm. long. Disinfect and bandage with or with- out suturing wounds. Leave bandage in place 6 to 8 days. NRURECToMY OF THE MEDIAN Â«NERVE. Fig. 32. Instruments. Razor, scissors, convex scalpel, artery and compression forceps, tenacula, aneurism needle, suture material. Technique. The operation is performed on the median surface of the huinero-radial articulation on the recumbent horse after the affected foot has been removed from the hob- bles and bound upon the extension splint [or fully extended on the operating table]. The foot is drawn out firmly from the shoulder, inclined somewhat forward. The operator kneels between the neck and the forearm and, after the region of the elbow joint is washed with soap and water, searches for the median nerve where it glides over the pos-

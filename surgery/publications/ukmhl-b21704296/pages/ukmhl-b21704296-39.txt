Intravenous Injection. 2 7 assistant draws the ligature tight and ties it by a knot con- sisting of two hitches, each of which is a bow and which can be completely loosened by pulling the cut ends (Fig. 13). If the ligature is tied by any of the ordinary knots it will be necessary to again cast the patient at the time of its removal ten days later. 4th. The parts around the ligature are now slightly wounded so that the resulting cicatrix will hold the aryte- noid cartilage in place after the ligature is removed. This wounding consists of an incision through the mucous mem- brane along the posterior border of the arytenoid and a resection of 2 cm. of the vocal cord beginning .5 cm. from the ligature. Return the patient to the lateral recumbent position to revive from the anaesthetic. No form of intubation or tamponing that will forcibly dilate the incision is admissible. After-care. Apply antiseptics to the superficial parts of the wound. In ten days the ligature is untied and gently pulled out. Alarming dyspnoea may occasionally occur from tumefaction of the laryngeal mucous membrane, at any time during the first four days following the operation. Usually this condition can be met by simply dilating the dermal incision by means of sutures passed through each edge of the wound and tied at the poll, but when this fails tracheotomy must be resorted to. It is never advisable to insert a tube through the original incision. INTRAVENOUS INJECTION. Fig. 14. Instruments. Scissors, hypodermic syringe. Technique. The operation is performed on the standing horse on the right jugular vein at the juncture of the upper and middle thirds of the neck. At this place the subscapulo- hyoideus muscle lies between the jugular vein and the

38 Puncture of the Intestines. right flank on the standing horse, io cm. in front of the external angle of the ilium and the same distance below the tranverse processes of the lumbar vetebrae, that is, at the most prominent part of the distension. After the skin at this place has been clipped or shaved, disinfected and dis- placed toward the external angle of the ilium, make a small puncture through the skin with a lancet and then with the trocar held in the hollow of the right hand push it with a strong thrust through the skin, tendinous expansion of the subcutaneous muscle, the external and internal oblique and transverse abdominal muscles, subperitoneal fat and perito- neum, in the direction of the elbow of the left side, enter- Fig. i8a.â€”Intestine trocar with she&th. Outside diam. of canula 3 mm., length of canula 16 cm. ing the base of the caecum and introducing the trocar to the ring on the canula. After the withdrawal of the stilette the evacuation of the gas occurs at times intermittently owing to collapse of the intestine. Occlusion of the canula is to be overcome by introducing the stilette. When removing the trocar canula, in order to prevent the dropping of food particles out of the canula into the perito- neal cavity, replace the stilette, press the skin against the abdominal wall with the left hand and remove the trocar with a spiral motion. The external opening may be closed with iodoform collodion. [We very much prefer a much smaller trocar than is generally sold by dealers for the pur- pose, the canula being 3 mm. outside diameter by 16 cm. long. The triangular point of the stilet is much elongated (12 mm.) furnishing a cutting edge almost equal to a lancet, the incision with which latter is thus dispensed with, the

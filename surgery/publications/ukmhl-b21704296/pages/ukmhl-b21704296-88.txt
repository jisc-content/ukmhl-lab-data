76 Resection of the Lateral Cartilage. axis of the foot, divide the cartilage into anterior and pos- terior halves and extirpate the latter first, by dissecting it out on the outer and inner side from the parachondral tissue with the double-edged sage knife. The point of the sage knife must be constantly directed against the cartilage. Since the inner surface of the anterior half of the cartilage lies immediately against the capsular ligament of the corono- pedal articulation the latter should be sharply extended by which means the capsular ligament is drawn away from the cartilage before its extirpation. The anterior half of the cartilage is then removed in the same way, except with the greatest possible care. Remnants of cartilage and granulations are to be removed with the curette. Then cut away with the scissors and knife any remnants of cartilage adherent to the flap, thin if necessary the entire flap and excise the fistulous openings. After thorough disinfection of the entire field of operation return the flap to its former position and retain it there by a sufficient num- ber of interrupted sutures, irrigate the wound surface with iodoform ether and cover the parts over with iodoform gauze and tampons which rest firmly upon the perpendicular wall of horn. Finally invest the hoof and pastern up to the fetlock joint with oaknm and lay a muslin bandage over it, the turns of which must extend from above downward. The bandage is protected by means of a leather shoe or pieces of sacking and the elastic bandage removed. If the animal is tree from fever, feels well and eats well, the bandage is left in position from 12 to 14 days. Healing by first intention.

Trifacial Neurectomy. 17 the infra-orbital neural foramen. Locate by touch the in- fra-orbital foramen below the levator labii superioris pro- prius muscle and displace the latter downwards (toward the inferior maxilla) until the foramen can be felt above the muscle. With the muscle displaced begin an incision, above the levator muscle in order to avoid the branches of the glosso-facial vessels below it, 1 cm. above the foramen and carry it downward directly over the middle of the 5th nerve a distance of 5 or 6 cm., cutting through skin, sub- cutem and the levator labii superioris alaque nasi muscle, laying bare the nerve at its emergence from the foramen. Let an assistant hold the lips of the wound apart and the le- vator muscle downwards with two tenacula, dissect away the connective tissue surrounding the nerve until the latter is clearly defined, pass the aneurism needle beneath the nerve from above downwards being specially careful to in- clude the uppermost or dorsal twigs, and passing a curved probe pointed scalpel or one blade of a pair of scissors underneath it, divide the nerve at the foramen, grasp the free end with compression or other forceps and excise a piece at least 3 cm. long including all branches. Cleanse the wound, sprinkle with iodoform and close with continu- ous sutures. Place the square piece of muslin centrally over the wound and fix it securely to the skin by means of a strong suture at each corner, in order to protect the wound while the other nerve is being cut. Turn the animal to the opposite side and repeat the operation on the other nerve except the square piece of muslin which is here unneces- sary. A.% soon as the animal stands, remove the protective piece of muslin from the first wound, disinfect wounds and leave undisturbed to heal by primary union. Avoid halter, bridle or other fixtures which might injure the wounds after operation.

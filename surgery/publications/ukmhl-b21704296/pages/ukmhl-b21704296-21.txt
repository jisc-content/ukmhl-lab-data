Trephining the Maxillary Sinuses. 9 munication with the superior maxillary sinuses and the superior turbinated bone of the same side so that indirectly the irrigating fluid can escape through the nasal opening by way of the maxillary sinus or the injured superior tur- binated bone. In order to prevent aspiration of the fluid, which is generally purulent, and to facilitate its escape, irri- gation must be carried out with the head elevated and flexed. An artificial connection between the frontal sinus and the nasal passage can be made by passing the probe in a downward and inward direction, forcing it through the thin bony plates and mucous membrane of the turbinated bone and then by means of the probe pointed scalpel cut an opening about 2 cm. in diameter. In order to prevent aspi- ration into the lungs, the animal must be allowed to get up immediately, or if under anaesthesia, a tampon trachea tube should be inserted in the trachea. In case of severe hemor- rhage, the cavity can be tamponed for twenty-four hours with a long strip of gauze one end of which hangs out of the wound and the tampon fixed in position by two sutures passed through the lips of the wound. The operation can be carried out in the standing position if the animal is quiet. TREPHINING THE MAX I EL ARY SINUSES. Fig. 4. Technique. Shave the skin over the superior maxillary bone on the median side of the zygomatic ridge. Make a circular incision as large as the diameter of the trephine through the skin, subcutem and periosteum down to the bone, the lateral or outer margin of the circle being about 15 mm. nasalwards from the zygomatic ridge toward the lateral border of the levator labii superiorus muscle and place the trephine 7 cm. above the lower end of the zygo- matic ridge. The trephining is carried out as described above. It must be remembered that the superior maxillary 2

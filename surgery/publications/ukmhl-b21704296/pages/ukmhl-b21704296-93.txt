Amputation of the Claws in Cattle. 8r The bandage remains for 12 or 14 days. the thumb rests upon the thinly rasped horn while with the other hand the claw is moved from side to side. At the lowest point of the articulation push the double-edged sage knife into the joint, the cavity of the knife being directed toward the fetlock, and make in the joint a curved incision at first forward and upward to the neighborhood of the coro- nary band then with strong flexion of the foot a second curved incision backward and upward which, however, ex- tends only to the navicular bone. By this incision the operator divides the horn, the sensitive lamina, the external corono-pedal ligament and the capsular ligament of the corono-pedal articulation. Pass the knife between the navicular and pedal bones and extend the incision down- wards perpendicular to the solar surface to the sole, sepa- rating the navicular bone from the os pedis. In this manner the navicular bone is preserved as well as the ball of the heel, the latter of which is of special significance in healing. The inner wall of the claw with the powerfully developed corono-pedal ligament is divided from before backward. After the vessels which can be seen are ligated the articular surfaces of the navicular and coronary bones curetted and the necrotic remnants of tendon removed an antiseptic bandage, preferably of tar, is applied and a leather shoe or canvas covering placed over it for protection.

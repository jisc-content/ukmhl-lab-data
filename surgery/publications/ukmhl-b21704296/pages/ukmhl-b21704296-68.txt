Stringhalt Operation. 56 veins which run between the flexor pedis and the suspen- sory ligament. After the removal of the knife and after seeing that there is a wide space between the ends of the tendons, the foot is unbound from' the splint and the band- age applied to the metacarpus, which rests upon the fetlock joint and remains in position for eight days. Healing of the cutaneous wound by primary union. stringhalt operation. [Tenotomy of the lateral extensor of the pedis.] Fig. 28. Instruments. Razor, scissors, sharp tenotome. Technique. On the lateral side of the metatarsus there is formed a triangle opening toward the tarsus formed by the tendons of the extensor pedis longus muscle and the lateral extensor of the foot which unite on the anterior surface in the middle of the metatarsus. The tendonous sheath of the extensor pedis longus muscle reaches toward the toe to near the point of juncture of the two tendons ; the sheath of the lateral extensor ends below 3 to 4 cm. above the point of union. In the middle of this space without a sheath, which is 3 to 4 cm. long, and below the annular ligament of the hock the operation is carried out, after the skin has been shaved and disinfected. The operation can be performed upon the standing horse, a twitch being applied and the hind foot being taken up as for shoeing. The tendon of the lateral extensor is easily felt under the skin as a hard cord about the size of the little finger. Stretch the skin and grasp the tendon with the thumb and index finger of the left hand, insert the sharp tenotome with the cutting edge toward the foot perpendicularly upon the tendon through the skin, subcutem and aponeurosis derived from the crural fascia ; push the knife from before backward under the tendon, direct the cutting edge of the teno- otome against it and with the hock extended sever the

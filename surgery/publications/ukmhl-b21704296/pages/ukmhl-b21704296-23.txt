Trephining the Nasal Passage. n the end of the forceps into the sinus. Introduce a tapering, antiseptic piece of cheese cloth through the trephine wound, grasp it with the dressing forceps and draw it out until the lower end appears at the nostril while the upper end hangs from the trephine wound. The strip of cheese cloth may also be inserted by means of a probe, after the opening has been made. Arm a long probe with a strong thread, insert the probe through the trephine opening and the wound in the turbinated bone and pass it out through the nostril, attach the cheese cloth to the end of the thread and draw it into the wound by pulling upon the probe. Control hemor- rhage during operation : a. From skin, by compression or ligation, b. From intre-osseous vessels, by plugging with a conical piece of wood pushed into the vascular opening or by absorbent cotton pushed into the channel with the point of a needle or tenaculum, c. From the sinuses or wounded turbines by packing with cheese cloth or cotton. Remove tampons after 24 hours and renew for a second day if required. Leave all wounds open and irrigate with tepid antiseptics. TREPHINING THE NASAL PASSAGE. Fig. 4. Technique. The trephining is carried out by the method described, in the region of the nasal bone, close by the me- dian line of the face and according to indications either above or below a perpendicular line drawn from the lower end of the zygoma to the nasal arch. The operation must be immediately against the median line since otherwise the maxillary sinuses are easily opened or the superior turbine wounded at the point of insertion. Special care is also necessary in removing the disc of bone, because the superior turbine lies directly beneath it and bleeds profusely when wounded on its dorsal aspect. In all cases after trephining about the nose or face where inhalation of blood, septic

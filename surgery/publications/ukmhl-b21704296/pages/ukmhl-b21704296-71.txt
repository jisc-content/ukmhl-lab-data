59 Plantar Neurectomy. Technique. Most horses can be operated on standing, otherwise cast on the affected side and extend the tarsus. Shave and disinfect an area 5 to 6 cm. square on the inferior median surface of the hock over the course of the cunean tendon of the chief flexor of the metatarsus. Locate the tendon by palpation as it passes obliquely downward and backward and make a perpendicular incision at a point midway between the anterior and posterior borders of the hock or slightly anterior thereto about 1 cm. long, begin- ning at the lower border of the tendon and extending down- wards toward the foot. Insert the tenotome beneath the inferior border of the tendon and depressing the handle cut upwards and outwards through the tendon and fascia to the skin, or inserting the tenotome flatwise between the skin and tendon push it upwards to the superior border of the tendon,^then turn the cutting edge of the tenotome toward the tendon and elevating the handle, using the superior border of the wound as a fulcrum, cut the tendon through from above downwards. By firm pressure upon the teno- tome in the latter method periosteotomy is simultaneously accomplished.. The completion of the operation is evidenced by the retraction of the cut tendon leaving a well marked depression at the point of operation. Disinfect the wound, apply an aseptic bandage and allow to remain undisturbed for 6 days. Healing by primary union. PLANTAR NEURECTOMY. Fig- 30- Instruments. Razor, scissors, convex scalpel, artery for- ceps, compression forceps, tenacula, needles, suture mate- real, elastic ligature. Technique. A bandage saturated with sublimate or creolin solution is applied to the fetlock joint of the horse 24 hours before the operation, and the animal is cast in such a

OPERATIONS ON THE NECK. OPENING OF THE GUTTURAL POUCHES. Fig. 9. Instruments. Razor, scissors, convex pointed, and straight probe pointed scalpels, mouse-toothed and ligation forceps, tenacula, probe, trocar, curette, drainage tubing, needles, thread, absorbent cotton. Technique. 1. Viborg's method. The operation is pos- sible on the standing animal. By extending the head and compressing the jugular vein there is' brought out the tri- angle immediately behind the posterior border of the in- ferior maxilla and beneath the parotid gland comprised be- tween the posterior angle of the inferior maxilla the ter- minal tendon of the sterno-maxillaris muscle and the ex- ternal maxillary vein. I11 this so-called Viborg’s triangle after the removal of the hair and the disinfection of the skin which is maintained stretched, make a 5 cm. long incision through the skin and skin muscle im- mediately beneath the aforementioned tendon and paral- lel to it. It can also be done when tense swelling is not present by raising a fold of skin 2^ cm. high. In case of pronounced swelling in Viborg’s triangle the operator must determine his location for operating by the position of the sterno-maxillaris muscle. Then force a passage with the finger [or with blunt scissors or other blunt instrument] through the loose connective tissue in the area which is free from nerves and vessels on the inner or median side of the parotid gland and of the stylo-maxi Haris muscle to the gut- tural pouch and force a passage through it at its lowest point with the finger or a trocar. In order to open the empty guttural pouch it is desirable to grasp it by means of forceps. Through the operative wound a drainage tube can be introduced into the pouch, which can be fixed in its

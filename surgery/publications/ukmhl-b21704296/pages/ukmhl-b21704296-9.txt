PREFACE TO ENGLISH EDITION. Professor Frohner’s foregoing introduction to Dr. Pfeiffer’s manual explains fully its object. Having found it essential to effective instruction in surgical technique, that the student should have extensive laboratory experience in the more in- tricate surgical operations (the proper performance of which perforce, includes training in methods of confinement, anaesthesia, antisepsis, hemostasis, suturing, bandaging, etc.,) we have conducted a course in operations upon anaesthetized animals, which are destroyed while yet un- conscious, by which the student becomes familiar with the various operations under the normal conditions in the living animal. The non-existence of a satisfactory manual in English induced us to ask Dr. Pfeiffer’s permission to translate and use, so far as might suit our purposes, his Operations-Cursus, to which he readily assented, and in which his publisher, Mr. Richard Schoetz, concurred. It is, therefore, largely due to their courtesy and liberality that we are enabled to present to English speaking veterinary students and prac- titioners this little manual, accompanied by the worth given it by the valuable experience of Prof. Dr. Fiohner and Dr. Pfeiffer. With a view to enhancing the value of the work to British and American students, we have added some of the more recent, largely distinctively American, operations which we deem of sufficient value to warrant insertion in such a work. To this end, we have added cunean tenotomy, digital neurec- tomy, Bossi’s neurectomy of the peroneal nerve, McKillip’s operation for exploring the pharynx, Eustachian tubes, etc.

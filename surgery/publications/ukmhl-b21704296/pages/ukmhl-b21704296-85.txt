Resection of the Lateral Cartilage. 73 RESECTION OF THE LATERAL CARTILAGE. (Quittor Operation.) Fig. 36 and 37. Instruments. Elastic bandage, drawing knife, scissors, razor, hoof plane, tooth splinter forceps or other heavjr forceps for the removal of the horn, artery forceps, double- edged sage knife, curette, needle holder, thread, needles, iodoform ether, iodoform gauze, tampons, absorbent cotton, bandages. Technique. A few hours before the operation the affected foot of the horse is placed in a bath of creoliu solution after having first made a semicircular groove in the horn of the lateral wall and quarter down to the horny lamina. The operation is performed upon the recumbent anaesthetized animal, in such a position that the diseased cartilage of the affected foot lies upwards. After the application of the elastic bandage the groove in the horn is deepened with the drawing knife down to,the sensitive laminae without injuring them. The groove must be so located that it reaches the anterior end of the lateral cartilage, remaining a few cm. distant from the bearing surface of the wall and so that the lower semicircular border approaches the sensitive laminae abruptly. The hair on the coronary band is clipped or shaved and the entire foot up to the fetlock joint thoroughly cleansed with brush, soap, creoliu or sublimate solution and 50 per cent, alcohol. The levator is then inserted beneath the lowest part of the semicircular piece of horn which has been isolated, the horn is elevated from the sensitive struct- ures somewhat, grasped with the splinter forceps and care- fully loosened from the sensitive laminae by drawing upward in the direction of the lamina and bj^ drawing backward from the coronary papillae and keraphyllous tissue. After the coronary band has been smoothed with the scissors, make two perpendicular incisions through the skin of the coronary baud and the coronarjâ€™ band itself, one behind the 6

Tracheotomy. 22 through, in order to avoid hemorrhage separate the two sterno-thyro-hyoideus muscles, by means of tenacula, along the median line in the white strip of connective tissue. The trachea which is now laid bare is slit from below up- ward through tlnte or four tracheal rings if the operation is to be performed without loss of substance. By the method Fig. io.â€”Tracheotomy, s, Sterno-thyro-hyoidens muscle ; t, trachea; sc/i, mucous membrane of the posterior wall of the trachea; l, interannular ligament. with loss of substance penetrate at the lower angle of the wound, transversely, the lowest inter-annular ligament, elongate the incision to the right and left, make a vertical incision on each side upwards through one or two tracheal rings, grasp the partially detached portion of trachea with forceps and cut it out by means of an incision through the inter-annular ligament, which now constitutes the only union with the trachea. According to the size of the trachea tube and the width of the tracheal rings one or two tracheal rings are removed. The outer canula of the tube is now introduced into the trachea directed upwards, the inner inserted through the first and screwed fast to this with the thumb screw. If the cutaneous incision is too long, occlu- . sive sutures should be inserted through the skin above and below the trachea tube.

Venesection. 29 most firmly fixed. After testing the hypodermic needle to see that it is open, insert it just above the point of compres- sion, through the skin, cutaneous muscle and jugular wall in the direction of the vein from behind and below, forwards and upwards 1 to 2 cm. deep, so that the point of the needle enters the vein at its most distended part. In this way it is easy to prevent injury to the median wall of the vein. The needle is held between the second and third fingers of the right hand while the thumb covers its posterior opening. If the vein has been properly punctured blood will flow from the needle upon the removal of the thumb. In this case the compression is removed, the left hand grasps the needle, the right connects the hypodermic syringe, in which no air is contained, and slowly discharges the contents of the syringe. In withdrawing the needle be careful to press the skin firmly against the underlying part. The omission of this precaution frequently results in the formation of a subcutaneous extravasation of blood. If the vein is not entered at the first attempt the needle should be partly with- drawn and then pushed in again in a slightly different direction. For venesection a hollow needle 5 mm. in diameter is used. VENESECTION. Instruments. Razor or scissors, fleams, lancet, phle- botomy trocar, spring lancet, pin, thread or suture material. Technique. I. Phlebotomy with fleams is performed on the left jugular vein with the horse standing. The point of operation is the boundary line between the upper and middle cervical regions, because it is here that the subscapulo- hyoideus muscle which separates the jugular vein from the carotid artery is most voluminous. At this point the skin is shaved or clipped and disinfected. The extended blade of the fleam is grasped at-the joint with the thumb and index finger of the left hand, while the third and fourth

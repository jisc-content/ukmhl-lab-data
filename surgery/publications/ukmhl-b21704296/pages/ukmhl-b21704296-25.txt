13 Ligation of the Parotid Duct. maxillary artery about 3 mm. in diameter, pulsating in the living animal. Between this and the oral border of the masseter muscle make an incision about 4 cm. long parallel with the artery through the skin and skin muscle. This incision is more readily made by gathering up a fold of skin about 2 cm. high and cutting through this fold. Raise the loose connec- tive tissue with a pair of forceps and excise it. Immedi- Fig. 6.â€”Ligation of parotid duct, (life size), a, external maxillary artery ; v, external maxillary vein ; st, parotid duct; m, masseter muscle. ately behind the external maxillary artery is the external maxillary vein and behind this and immediately on the oral border of the masseter muscle lies the parotid duct. I11 case of salivary calculi which cannot be removed through the mouth, and cystic dilation of the parotid duct, make the cutaneous incision at the affected point, open the parotid duct, and after removal of calculus, etc., close the wound by means of intestinal suture in such a way that the exter- nal surfaces of the lips of the wound in the wall of the duct are brought in contact, or ligate the duct on the proximal side of the point of operation. Ligation is accomplished by passing a strong silk thread behind the diseased part by means of a curved needle, carrying it around the parotid

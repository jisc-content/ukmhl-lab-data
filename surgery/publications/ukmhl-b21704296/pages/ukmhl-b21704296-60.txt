Vaginal Ovariectomy. 48 Technique.

The point of operation is determined by the character of the disease of the penis and the object to be attained by the operation. If possible amputate in front of the preputial ring. After the penis is drawn out, and the preputial region is carefully cleansed with brush and soap, an assistant grasps the penis just behind the preputial opening with the hand and holds it firmly. A temporary elastic ligature is then applied in front of this hand around the penis and the organ excised by circular incision about 5 cm. in front of the elastic ligature or immediately in front of the preputial ring. The dorsal blood vessels of the penis are ligated separately. The urethra lying on the ventral side of the penis, and which is covered by the corpus cavernosum of the urethra, is dissected out of the urethral groove for a distance of about 2 cm., its dorsal wall slit and the mucous membrane sutured, spread out fan-like to the surrounding tissues. The urethra can also be slit dorsally and ventrally and the one half sutured to the left and the other to the right. A silk ligature is applied to the corpus cavernosum of the penis and the elastic ligature then removed. After a few days the silk ligature is also removed. VAGINAL OVARIECTOMY.

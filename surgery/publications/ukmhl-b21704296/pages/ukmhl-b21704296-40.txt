28 Intravenous Injection. carotid artery. After clipping the hair, the skin should be carefully disinfected. The vein lies in the jugular groove between the mastoido-hutneralis and the sterno-maxlllaris muscles covered only by the skin and cervical panniculus carnosus muscle. The operator stands by the right shoulder of the horse and compresses the jugular with the thumb of the left hand (Fig. 14) or with second to fourth fingers of the left hand, in which case the ball of the thumb rests upon the mastoido-humeralis muscle, in such a way that the vein becomes filled above the point of compression in the shorn area so that it stands out like a swollen cord. In case of fleshy necked houses this compression is more readily attained if the animalâ€™s head is somewhat extended and elevated by an assistant. If the vein cannot be made promi- nent in this way the compression should be alternated suddenly and repeatedly ; the course of the vein then reveals itself by a wave-like movement which runs along the jugu- lar groove from above to below. Just above the point of compression the vein is most fully distended and is here also

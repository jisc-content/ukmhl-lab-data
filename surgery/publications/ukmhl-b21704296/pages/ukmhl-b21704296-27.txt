[McKillipâ€™s operation for making a manual exploration of the Eu- stachian tubes, guttural pouches, pharynx and posterior nares, and for operations upon those structures.] Instruments.

The patient is cast and secured in the lateral (costal) recumbent position and the head is turned upward. Techniqiie. The mouth speculum is adjusted and opened as far as is possible ; the tongue is protracted with the left hand while the right containing the knife on the middle finger is passed carefully through the fauces until the knife hooks over the posterior border of the soft palate. The knife is then gently drawn forward so as to make an in- cision along the median line of the soft palate from the pos- terior border to its attachment on the palatine bone. The hand is then retracted and the speculum removed for a few minutes to permit the patient to rid its throat of the slight hemorrhage and mucus that might have accumulated. Readjusting the speculum as before the right hand is again passed through the fauces and now that the palate is divided a digital exploration will perfectly reveal the pres- ence of any abnormality in the region.

Bossi's Doitble Neurectomy for Spavin. 7i II. ANTERIOR TIBIAE NEURECTOMY. [Neurectomy of the Deep Branch of the Peroneal Nerve.] Fig. 35- Instruments. As in preceding. Technique. Confine as in preceding with affected leg uppermost. Locate the furrow dividing the extensor pedis longus and lateralis (peroneus) muscles and shave and disin- fect the skin over an area 6 cm. long by '3 cm. wide directly over this depression and extending upward from a point 6 or 7 cm. above the tibio-astragaloid articulation. At a point 8 to 10 cm. above the flexure of the hock make an incision 5 or 6 cm. long over the line of division between the two extensors of the foot, through the skin, the tibial aponeurosis and the special aponeurosis enveloping the ex- tensors. Superficially the operator passes near by the cutaneous division of the anterior tibial nerve. Separating the two muscles for their entire thickness there is found lying deeply 3 to 6 cm. from the surface, and accompanied by a small artery and vein, immediately against the flexor metatarsi magnus, the deep lying branch of the peroneal nerve. Pass the aneurism needle beneath it and remove a piece 3 to 4 cm. long. Close the cutaneous wound with in- terrupted sutures and dress autiseptieally without bandage. This operation is performed only in connection with the preceding and for the same purpose as ulnar, with median neurectomy, i. e., to complete the anaesthesia of the tarso- metatarsal parts.

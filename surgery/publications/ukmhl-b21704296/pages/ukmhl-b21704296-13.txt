OPERATIONS ON THE HEAD. EXTRACTION OF TEETH. Fig. x and 2. Instruments. Extracting forceps acting as a lever of the second class for the molars, extracting forceps acting as a lever of the first class for the pre-molars (the forceps for the superior pre-molars are bent), fulcra of various sizes, mouth opener with abundant lateral working room, reflecting lamp, exporteur forceps, toothpick, splinter forceps. Technique. With quiet horses extraction may be carried out with the animal standing, the horse being backed into a corner. Resistant animals must be laid down. After the application of the mouth speculum the diseased teeth must be properly identified 1)}' manual exploration, it must be determined whether they are already loose or if they have an abnormal direction (for example, are misdirected toward the cheek), the condition of the neighboring teeth, etc. These investigations can be rendered easier in case of insuf- ficient daylight by illuminating the mouth cavity with the reflecting lamp [or still better, by means of an incandescent electric lamp]. After the partially chewed food pellets have been removed with the toothpick or the fingers, count the teeth from before backward until the diseased tooth is reached, by passing the fingers along their median or inner sides. For the extraction of the molars, extracting forceps acting on the principle of a lever of the second class with fulcra are used, the latter having a plane and a convex surface. The pre molar forceps are on the principle of a lever of the first class, those for the superior pre-molars are bent on the flat, because if they were straight the forceps handles would strike against the superior incisors and hinder the deep fixation of the forceps.

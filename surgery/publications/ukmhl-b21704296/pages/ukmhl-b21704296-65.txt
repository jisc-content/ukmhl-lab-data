Vaginal Ovariectomy. 53 grasped by the thumb and index finger above. The chain loop should be of barely sufficient size to admit of the easy passage of the ovary. Holding the ovary with the one hand tighten the chain quickly with the other, examine to make sure that a loop of intestine is not caught, draw the ovary well through and get a large portion of the oviduct, and cut off promptly, holding to the ovary until carried out through the vulva. Remove the other ovary in the same way. Generally it is most convenient to remove the left ovary with right hand and vice versa, but both may be removed with either hand. Wash away any blood from external parts, applv sublimate solution freely to vulva, perineum and tail. Keep the patient quiet for five or six days, and •feed lightly on laxative diet. If infection occur mop out the vagina with antiseptics. If abscesses form open them promptly into the vagina or rectum by thrusting an index finger through their walls. If the infection causes difficult defecation by pressure on the rectum or swelling of its coats through inflammatory implication keep the feces pultaceous by means of enemas.

Trephining the Frontal Sinuses. . 7 TREPHINING THE FRONTAL SINUSES. Fig. 4. Instruments Razor, scissors, convex scalpels, compres- sion forceps, tenacula, probe, trephine, bone scraper, curette, gouge, bone gouging toreeps, hammer, chisel, disinfection material, absorbent cotton, long curved uterine dressing forceps, bone screw, lens shaped bone knife, probe pointed scalpel. Technique. Shave or clip the hair from the region of the frontal bone at a level with the superior border of the orbital cavity and disinfect the area carefully. With a heavy convex scalpel make a circular incision, as large as the diameter of the trephine, the median border of which shall be 1 cm. from the median line of the face, directly through the skin, subcutem and periosteum, seize the isolated area with a tenaculum and with the scalpel or bone scraper detach the periosteum from the bone and remove in one piece, the skin, subcutaneous tissue and periosteum. Con- trol hemorrhage. With the centerbit extended place the trephine accurately upon the denuded area, perpendicular to the surface of the bone, and by revolving it to and fro force the centerbit into the bone and continue until the trephine has cut well into the bone, when the centerbit should be withdrawn and the operation continued, being careful to maintain the trephine perpendicular to the bone. The operation is facilitated by grasping the trephine between the thumb and fingers of the left hand, constituting a con- duit in which it can glitle back and forth. The pressure under which the sawing is carried out must not be too great. When the bony plate which has been sawed around begins to loosen, the bone screw is screwed into the centerbit open- ing and the piece of bone is broken out, or it is pried out with the bone gouge or chisel. Uneven edges of bone should be smoothed with the lens-shaped knife. The ab- normal contents of the frontal sinus can now escape or be re-

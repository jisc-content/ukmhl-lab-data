67 Neurectomy of the Ulnar Nerve. and approximate the skin with a continuous sutuie. 1 he tampon and sutures remain from i to 2 days. Since the sensation of the lower part of the leg is also maintained by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve which below the carpus, covered by the tendon of the oblique flexor of the carpus, communicates with the lateral plantar nerve, neuiectomy of the median nerve does not completely effect the desired end. In order to produce complete anaesthesia, therefore, from median neurectomy, it is necessary at the same time to perform ulnar neurectomy. (Compare following chapter.) NEURECTOMY OF THE ULNAR NERVE. Fig- 33- Instruments. Same as preceding. Technique. Above and behind the carpus there may be felt a groove between the external and the middle flexors of the carpus. At this point 10 cm. above the pisiform bone the skin is shaved and disinfected and an incision 6 cm long made through the skin and antibrachial fascia. This in- cision extends just outside the median line of the posterior surface of the radius in such a way that the superior angle of the wound is about 1 cm. farther outward than the lower. Beneath the fascia between the aforementioned muscles is seen the ulnar nerve, on the median or inner side of it the collateral ulnar vein and between the two and somewhat deeper the collateral ulnar artery. The nerve, about 3 mm. in diameter is picked up with the aneurism needle, severed at the upper and lower angles of the wound, the lips of the wound united by a continuous suture and a bandage ap- plied. Healing by first intention. This operation is, as has already been remarked, only carried out in connection with neurectomy of the median nerve.

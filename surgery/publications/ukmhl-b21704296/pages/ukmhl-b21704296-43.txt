Venesectiofi. 3i and tied. In applying the loop, care is to be taken to not elevate the skin from the underlying parts. If the operation does not succeed at the first effort, one should select an undamaged portion of skin for a second attempt. II. With the lancet the operation is performed on the right side of the neck. I11 both operations the operator stands near the horseâ€™s shoulder. The vein is compressed as illustrated in Fig. 14. The lancet is held between the thumb and index finger of the right hand with the blade at right angles to the handle, the thumb and finger being so placed on the blade that the latter can barely penetrate the vein, and the instrument is then pushed in just in front of the left thumb through the skin subcutem and venous wall as deep as the fingers holding the lancet will permit. The blade must be held perpendicular to the axis of the vein, the point must not be directed backward (dorsalwards). The wound in t-he vein is then slit upward somewhat (toward the head) by dorsal flexion of the hand. In cattle the vein is compressed by means of a cord tightly drawn around the neck, and the operator takes a position for his own safety and convenience beside the animal on the side where the operation is to be performed, while an assistant holds the animal by the horns, [or nose]. The closure of the phlebotomy wound occurs in a similar manner as in I., only with the modification that the thumb and second finger of the right hand grasps the cutaneous wound from before and the needle is pushed through the lips of the wound by the left hand with the aid of the right index finger. III. With the trocar the operation is performed in the same manner, as has been described for intravenous injec- tion. So long as the flow of blood continues the compres- sion of the vein must not be intermitted.

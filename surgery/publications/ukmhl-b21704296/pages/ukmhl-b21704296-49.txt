37 Puncture of the Intestines. the point of the trocar projects beyond it barely enough to penetrate the thoracic walls (4 to 6 cm). After the skin over the seat of operation has been drawn aside by the left hand place the trocar at the anterior border of the rib slightly inclined forward and push it with a sharp thrust through the skin, skin muscle, intercostal muscles, internal thoracic fascia and pleura into the pleural sac. As soon as the resistance ceases, the thoracic cavity has been entered. The stilette is now withdrawn and the existing fluid which may be pus, blood, serum, etc., escapes. While this escape is at first continuous, it later becomes rhythmic, synchro- nous with expiration. The intermission of the outflow during inspiration permits, with the ordinal trocar the en- trance of air into the chest cavity. This occurrence may be avoided by closing the canula with the finger after each ex- piration of the animal. The pneumothorax is best pre- vented by using Billrothâ€™s trocar. [The same result may be attained with an ordinary trocar by passing a piece of rubber tubing over the canula and dropping the free end in the vessel receiving the escaping liquid.] If the outflow becomes entirely interrupted introduce the stilette and re- move the occluding substance, usually fibrinous clots, from the canula. To remove the instrument, introduce the sti- lette into the canula, press the skin against the chest wall with theileft hand and draw the trocar out promptly. As the displaced skin resumes its normal position the puncture is hermetically sealed. The outer opening may be covered withdodoform collodion. PUNCTURE OF THE INTESTINES. Fig. 18 and 18a..

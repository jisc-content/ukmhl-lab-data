62 Digital Neurectomy. to 5 cm. long is removed. In front of the nerve lies the median metacarpal artery and in front of this the median metacarpal vein. The cutaneous wound is united by a con- tinuous suture and a temporary bandage applied. The ex- tension splint is then removed, the foot replaced in the hobble and the horse turned to the other side. Neurectomy of the lateral metacarpal nerve is carried out in the same way after which a sterile bandage is applied which is al- lowed to remain eight days. Healing by primary union. DIGITAL NEURECTOMY. Fig- 3i- Instruments. Razor, scalpel, probe pointed scalpel, te- nacula (2), aneurism needles (2), bandages. Technique. Restraint of animal the same as for the plantar operation. Extending downwards from the fetlock joint toward the coronet, between the posterior border of the pha- langes and the deep flexor tendon there is a slight furrow at the posterior part of which, close to the external margin of the tendon, lies the median or principal digital nerve (the chief branch of the metacarpal or metatarsal) accompanied in front by the digital artery, in front of which lies the digital vein. Immediately behind the nerve and generally lying a trifle deeper, is quite commonly found a second venous trunk of considerable size. Near the middle of the first phalanx the nerve is crossed externally in an oblique direction from above to below and from behind to before by a white liga- mentous baud slightly broader than the nerve extending from the posterior region of the fetlock to the lateral cartilage of the pedal bone. This must not be mistaken for the nerve and need ifot be if it is remembered that the nerve is accom- panied on the same plane and in a like direction by the satellite artery and vein, the former being enclosed with the nerve in a fibrous sheath. Midway between the fetlock and

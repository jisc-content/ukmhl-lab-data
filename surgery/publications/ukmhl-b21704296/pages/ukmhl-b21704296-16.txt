4 Repulsion of Teeth. hand. [In some young horses we have found it necessary to cut the tooth in two in its middle with tooth cutting for- ceps in order to remove it]. With the pre-molar forceps the fulcrum is placed beneath the extension in front of the jaws of the forceps. This extension rests upon the grinding surface behind the diseased tooth and acts in such a manner that the pre-molars can be withdrawn from before backward in their line of direction. For the extraction of the inferior pre-molars the forceps handles must be pressed upward, in the superior downward. Satisfactory extraction can only occur after the disappearance of resistance is recognized, accompanied by a crepitant sound due to the entrance of air into the aveolus. REPULSION OF TEETH. [For the removal of molars and premolars and alveolar odontomes which cannot be extracted with forceps.] Fig- 3- Instruments Razor, convex scalpels (2), trephine, bone gouge, bone gouging forceps, light bone chisel, heavy bone chisel, mallet, compression forceps, curette, heavy tooth punch concave at distal end, scissors, needles, thread, ab- sorbent cotton, antiseptic gauze, extracting forceps, heavy splinter forceps, dressing forceps, trachea tube, tenacula, metal probe, mouth speculum. Technique. Secure in lateral recumbent position, produce anaesthesia, and if sinuses are involved in a way to make possible the inhalation of purulent matter, blood or other liquid, prepare for tracheotoni}' (which see) and perform it in time to avert any danger. Shave the region over the affected tooth and trephine by the method described in the followdng chapter down upon the fang of the tooth, or in case of odontomes, upon the tumor. I11 case of tooth fistula, the identity of the affected member is best ascertained by pass-

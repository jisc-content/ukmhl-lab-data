185 them, and their deep extent, it may be difficult to say whether they be quite adherent to the surrounding parts, or move a little. It is evident, that the propriety of an operation, par- ticularly in the case of an extensive tumour, must depend on the probability of its being defined by a capsule; for if directly connected to the neighbouring parts, and shooting between the muscles, and around the vessels and nerves, it is impossi- ble to remove the whole; and if any part be left, especially if its nature be malignant, we are sure to have a return, if the patient escape the immediate risk. If the operation be undertaken, the tumour is to be exposed by a convenient incision, and if any vein be necessarily divided, both extremi- ties are to be immediately pressed with the finger. The fascia is to be freely divided, and the face and margin of the proper substance of the tumour made quite bare with the finger, or a blunt instrument. The tumour may be separated, and by slight pulling, perhaps even by its own weight, it may be drawn from its deeper recess. If not, we must not pull strongly, as that causes great pain and difficulty of breathing, but must press in the finger to ascertain how it is connected, and the cause of its detention. By tearing, or cautiously dividing, some original contraction of the capsule, or an indurated band, or by rupturing some bag of soft cellular substance or fluid, we may get the whole away. There may be very little haemorrhage, for, the tumour being in a capsule, the arteries in the vicinity are .not divided, perhaps only the laryngeal requires to be tied, or one or two enlarged branches of the primaries given off by the carotid. Indeed, such tumours, whether large or small, are removed with comparative facility if contained in a capsule. But if not, the difficulty and the danger are great; for, both the external and internal caro- tids, and jugular vein, and the eighth pair of nerves, the ninth and glossopharyngeus, may be involved, and the tumour be so connected to the constrictors and mucous membrane of the mouth, and perhaps apparatus of the larynx, that the surgeon who, trusting to the account I have given of the capsulated tumour, has undertaken the extirpation of one which is directly adherent, may, even after tying the common

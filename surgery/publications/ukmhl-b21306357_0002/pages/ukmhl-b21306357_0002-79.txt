59 ramus by this layer, the attachment of which to the ramus we have not yet cut. If we raise the lower extremity of the gland, and the back part of it, and separate the connexion for- ward to the ramus, we shall find that we come to this connexion of fascia and ramus; and in performing this dissection we have exposed the styloid expansion, which we find to be fixed at the ramus, and to form the bond of connexion, there, between the gland and the ramus, and to be a continuation of the fascia from the masseter muscle on the outside of the jaw, and the pterygoideus on the inside. W^e also find that the parotid gland has been resting on the styloid expansion, and connected to it by a cellular layer, sometimes so strong and distinct as to resemble a lamina of fascia reflected along the under surface of the gland, and intimately adherent to it. This extends from the lower end of the gland for more than an inch above the angle of the jaw. Sixth, If we raise or remove this part of the gland, we see the carotid aiâ€™tery and vein lying on the styloid expansion; but these are not yet quite bare, for a thin layer passes over them and the digastric muscle; when this is removed, we see that the carotid artery has come out at the upper margin of the digastric and stylo-hyoideus, and got on the styloid expansion, lying between it and this thin layer, and conse- quently not in the substance of the gland, in wliich it is not, properly speaking, involved, tiU we get to an inch and a quarter above the angle of the jaw. Seventh, The styloid expansion, and masseteric or myloid fascia, are really continuous, and merely different parts of the same sheet. From the angle of the jaw, there goes off a sep- tum from this sheet, dividing the parotid from the submaxillary gland. It seems, however, to have more connexion with the styloid than the myloid portion. It runs downward and backward toward the mastoid muscle, and is attached to its margin about an inch below the angle of the jaw, being lost there in the general fascia of the throat. Eighth, From the angle of the jaw, and its connexion with the pterygoid muscle, a strip of fascia more distinct than the neighbouring sheet to which it belongs, and gradually taper-

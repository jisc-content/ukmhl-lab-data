136 to every attentive surgeon, that in too many instances such glands are allowed to remtiin, because they give, at present, no trouble, and are expected, from their nature, to remain stationary, or to suppurate, and yet in some time, when again examined, they are found not only to be of a fonnidable nature, and producing effects which must be fatal, but also to have so extended, as to render it quite impossible to re- move them. Glandular tumours which do not suppurate are always more suspicious in the adult, or in advanced life, than in the young person. The Nerves in the neck are divisible into those coming off from the spinal cord or base of the brain, to be distributed to the muscles of the neck, or parts about the throat, and those which from both sources, go to the more important viscera of the thorax and abdomen. In the triangle formed by the superior and inferior oblique, and the rectus major, we may, by clearing out dense cellular sub- stance, expose the vertebral artery, between the atlas and occi- put, on its way into the cranium. If we perform this dissec- tion cautiously, we discover in this triangle the suboccipital nerve, which passes out by the aperture in the broad liga- ment, which connects the first vertebra to the foramen mag- num, through which the artery enters, the two running in contrary directions. Its trunk adheres to the inner side of the artery, and passes out below it, nearly midway between the mastoid process and spine of the dentata. Under the artery, it forms a ganglion, which divides into an anterior and poste- rior branch, both of which may be seen, or found deep in the triangle. The posterior comes out from below the artery, just as the vessel is going into the foramen magnum, rather nearer the mastoid process, than to the spine of the dentata. It is found just between the artery and the atlas, at the supe- rior margin of the inferior oblique, and, immediately turning over the back of the artery, close on its coat, ascends to the inferior margin of the superior oblique, and divides into branches to these deep muscles, besides sending a branch to join the first cervical. The anterior branch runs forward in

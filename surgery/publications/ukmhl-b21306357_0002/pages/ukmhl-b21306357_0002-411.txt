391 as dio-ital branches of the nerve, must be divided, unless we o can cut from the back of the hand, and save the palm. Even in this case, we must, in removing the metacarpal bone, take care not to separate the adjoining fingers much, as we thereby stretch or lacerate their carpal connexions. The metacarpal bone of the forefinger cannot be entirely removed, without cutting the insertion of the flexor, and the extensor carpi radialis longior. In removing that of the midfinger, the in- sertion of the extensor brevior is cut. Tumours, generally of a fibro-cartilaginous nature, often form on the finger, and usually on its face, or from its side. They may spring either from the periosteum, or from the inside of the bone itself, and in both cases, the surface is more or less absorbed. The flexor tendons are sometimes separat- ed, so as to be placed on each side of the tumour, but they may also be covered by it, and in both cases remain healthy. From the condition of the bone, amputation of the finger is generally necessary, for extirpation cannot be depended on. CHAP. IV. ;OF THE PELVIC REGION. At, and above the brim of the pelvis, there are five parts to be observed. The iliac fossa, and corresponding portion of the brim; the more anterior portion, where the iliacus and psoas pass out; the space between the inner or anterior margin of the muscles, and the symphysis ; behind, the wing of the sacrum, and transverse processes ol the lumbar vertebrae; the pro- montoi'y of the sacrum. In the cavity, we have also five, the symphysis and smooth back of the pubis; the foramen thy- roideum ; the inclined plane of the ischium; the sacro-sciatic

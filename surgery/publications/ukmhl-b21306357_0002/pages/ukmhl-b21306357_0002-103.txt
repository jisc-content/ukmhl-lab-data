88 the sheath, the eighth nerve and vein, lie to the outside of the exposed artery, and the aneurism needle is to be intro- duced close by the substance of the artery on its outside, and carried close under it, and up on the tracheal side, where it often pushes a little cellular substance before its point. This is to be cut through, and the needle carried on, so as to allow the thread to be caught hold of. One well waxed thread is sufficient. It is to be tied with moderate tightness; one end is then to be cut off, and the wound brought together more solito. The operation is simple, but requires attention to the following particulars: that the incision be made exactly by the margin of the mastoid muscle, the course of which has been described; that we neatly separate the expansion which connects this with the sterno-thyroid, which shelves a little under the mastoid; that we then press these a little asunder, and cautiously go directly back, as it were, to the vertebrae, without inclining outward or inward, till we come to the deep expansion of fascia, which is to be divided; that the sheath be fairly opened; that the artery, for a sufficient space, be quite and cleanly exposed on its front and outer side ; that this be done by keeping always close to the vessel; that the needle be introduced in absolute contact with the artery, and kept so that it may not rupture the sheath behind, and injure, by laceration or rubbing, the sympathetic nerve; that it be brought up in contact with the vessel, and within the sheath at the tracheal side, that it may not injure any of the nerves; in short, that nothing but the bare vessel be included. It should literally and truly be the bare vessel; for if any nerv- ous twig be included, serious consequences may ensue. The coats are not indeed to be scraped so as to injure them, but the vessel is to be cleanly dissected, for the breadth of the needle, from any connexion, and from loose cellular covering, to diminish the risk of including any little branch from the sympathetic. The operation is easily performed, but it is not free from much danger, not imm^iate, for of that there IS none. The fear of haemorrhage, which was the bugbear to the best surgeons of the old times, is now banished, for the operation may be performed without the loss of two ounces of

IS If, after removing these superficial muscles, the finger be run from the internal jugular vein backward, it will pass, succes- sively, over the scalenus anticus, the outermost of the axillary nerves, the scalenus posticus, the levator scapulas, and, lastly, on the splenius capitis. The posterior margin of the levator is not perpendicular, but somewhat oblique, and corresponds, so far down as the scapula, to a line drawn from the end of the atlas, or back of the mastoid process, to the spine of the second, or sometimes, from being less oblique, the fourth dorsal vertebra. This will pass along the back, at the dis- tance of an inch and a quarter out from the spine of the first dorsal vertebra. It does not indeed extend so far as this line maybe drawn, for it meets the rho'mboideus at an angle, joins it, or even slips a little under its margin, to which it becomes united by firm cellular substance. It then winds forward with it to the scapula, and is inserted, for an inch and a quarter, along the upper, and an inch and a half down the posterior costa. The two muscles adhere for the space of two inches and a half, and, above this junction, the levator is connected at its posterior margin Avith the splenius. An expansion of firm aponeurosis goes down over the splenius to the scapula, and can also be traced from the spines of the vertebrae under the rhomboideus to that bone, as a continuous sheet. It goes under the levator at the angle of the scapula, adheres to its under surface, and to the adjacent parts on the ribs, connect- ing the levator with the upper head of the serratus anticus, and therefore the levator often seems to be inserted into the rib as well as the scapula. The inferior head, and partly the next one, of the levator, rests on the scalenus posticus as it is arising from the rib, and between these two, very low, we find, interposed or intermingling, the upper head of the serratus, all the three muscles being connected. The apon- eurosis, already noticed, is reflected over the attachment of the serratus, at the posterior costa of the scapula, and goes down under the latissimus dorsi, and thus we see, from the existence of the aponeurosis, and the firm connexion of the muscles, that nothing can pass from the axilla, or from beneath the scapvila, toward the spine, and vice versa^ and we

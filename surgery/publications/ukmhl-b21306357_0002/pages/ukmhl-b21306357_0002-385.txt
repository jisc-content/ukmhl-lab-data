365 of the biceps terulon, to the ulnar margin of the wrist, marks its track higher. By combining these, we have the course of the nerve. / Two or three inches above the elbow joint, the pronator nerve is detached, but it runs down on the hice of the trunk, not separating from it, till at least an inch below the joint. It enters the pronator muscle, and either sends branches freely to the flexors, or these come off separately from the trunk. When the nerve passes between the heads of the flexor sublimis, it detaches the interosseus, though this can be separated from the back of the nerve, for a little above the joint. It is, for a very short way, on the face, and then runs down by the radial side of the interosseous artery, giving off branches to the flexors of the finger and thumb, and passes with it through the foramen in the interosseous ligament, and down to the back of the wrist. Near the foramen, an anterior division comes off, which descends, covered by the quadratus, to the face of the wrist. About three inches above the wrist, the median gives offâ€™ the superficial palmar branch. This runs down by the radial side of the trunk, and, whilst that passes under the carpal ligament, this becomes superficial, running on the face of the ligament, to the skin of the palm of the hand. Besides these branches, the median, in its course down, gives some to the flexors, and communicates with twigs from the ulnar. The Radial artery maybe exposed and tied in any part of its course, which is in a line from the inside of the biceps tendon, to the face of the os trapezium. From the wrist, till at least four inches upward, the radial nerve is not near it, and it is only accompanied by its venas comites. At the wrist, it lies midway between the lateral tendon, or that of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and that of the flexor radialis, covered by the skin and fascia. There, and a handbreadth higher, we cut by the radial margin of the latter tendon, through the superficial fascia, and then expose a deeper layer, under which the artery lies. It is to be separated from the two veins between which it lies. In making the external incision, we shall find a branch of the median vein, a little more outward than the artery, with a

PREFACE. The First Volume of this work contains the Pathologi- cal ; this the Anatomical, or Mechanical Principles of Surgery, which completes the plan I proposed. A con- siderable part of this volume was printed some years ago, and from time to time has been carried on, till it is now finished. It is intended for two purposes : First, To be a guide, or assistance, to the student, in the dis- secting room, enabling him, with one of the ordinary manuals, to trace the different parts of the body, with a view to their practical importance, and to acquiring a facility of finding them, when necessary, in the living subject. If employed for this purpose, it will be much for his advantage, that he mark the differences which may exist, in the individual he is examining. Second, To assist the surgeon in studying the nature of injuries, the relations of tumours, and in planning his operations. Some important errors of the press have been discov- ered, which it will be proper to correct with the pen before the reader employ the volume.

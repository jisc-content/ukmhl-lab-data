269 other end of the wire is then turned into the canula, and pushed into the mouth. An angular portion, of cellular substance and buccinator, is thus included between the two limbs of the wire, and the ends being twisted together, in the mouth, this is constricted. Like a seton, the wire gradually, by absorption, is more and more loosened, and to use a com- mon expression, eats its way into the mouth. In the mean time, we have, from the first, been keeping the external wound closed, and may thus produce, an oblique fistula, into the mouth. When the gland itself is injured, we must lay the external wound closely together, and use moderate pressure, other- wise, a glandular fistula may be produced. The object is to obliterate the extremities of the divided ramuli. If a fistula have been produced, the same object is to be kept in view. When a part of the gland suppurates, and the abscess breaks externally, or a part sloughs out, we have no fistula in gen- eral produced, because the vasa efferentia are thus obliter- ated. CHAP. III. OF THE ANATOMY OF THE CLAVICULAR REGION, AND UPPER EXTREMITY. The vacancy at the top of the thorax, is from four inches, to four and a half, broad, or from one side to the other, and one and three quarters from the inside of the sternum, to the front of the vertebrae: but if we go back to the articulation of the rib, at the side of the vertebrae, it is three and a half. There passes, behind, on the spine, the oesophagus, which, when distended, can allow a substance, an inch in diameter, to descend. Just before this, is the trachea, the antero- posterior diameter of which, varies, from five, to seven-eighths of an inch. It is not close to the sternum, but descends from

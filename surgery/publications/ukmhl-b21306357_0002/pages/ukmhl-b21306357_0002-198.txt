178 the subclavian artery, it is quite out of the question—not that we cannot expose it, or turn the vein aside, without wound- ing it, although this be not altogether easy to be done with efficiency and safety—but because it is scarcely possible to put a ligature round the artery, without either cutting or including important nerves, and, most certainly, not without, even in the dead subject, greatly disturbing them. On the left side, the subclavian comes up deep, lying, in full and large- boned subjects, two inches back from the skin coverintr the clavicle, and fully half an inch back from the inner surface of that bone. It ascends by the outside of the carotid, but deeper, or obliquely behind it; and its inner margin is within half an inch of the articulation. It rises to the level of the upper surface of the clavicle, and bends outward to the scalenus. It is in this course quite covered by the jugular vein, beneath which, there lies, on the artery, the vertebral vein; so that it is difficult to expose the artery without doing violence to the veins. The par vagum which goes down by the outside of the carotid, gets at the clavicle, either behind that artery, or at least deep, and passes over the subclavian, and tlien down in the angular space, between these two vessels. The cardiac branch of the eighth, runs over the subclavian, with branches of the sympathetic; and the phrenic, passes down at the margin of the scalenus, by the outside of the vertebral artery, then on the subclavian and mammaria interna. Fi’om the depth of the artery, its connexion with vital nerves, the double layer of veins which covers it, the risk of wounding the pleui'a below, or the thoracic duct, if we go too high, I am wan-anted to say that no attempt ought to be made to expose and tie this part of the artery. In all tumours at this part, if the internal jugular vein be not interested, we are safe with regard to vital nerves; but if we require to turn aside the vein to get at any part behind it, the danger is great, not merely on account of the nerves, but also of the artery. No man should attempt the removal of a tumour in such circumstances, unless he be sure that the por- tion there is small and loosely attached; neither ought any tumour to be extirpated which would require the division of

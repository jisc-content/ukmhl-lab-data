32^ The Veins df the arm, leaving their particular relation, at its bend, for future consideration, consist of the cephalic on the outside, and the brachial, or continuation of the basilic, with the deep venae comites on the inside. From the back of the hand, two sets of veins arise; these unite at the middle of the back of the wrist, and form a trunk, called the cephalic, which winds up by the outside, or a very little farther for- ward, of the supinatoi-. It reaches the outer margin of the biceps, a little above the joint. From the hand, at the side of the thumb, veins rise, which run up by the side of the wrist, and radius, for a little way, receiving additions from the ball of the thumb. A little higher than the wrist, the trunk so formed, and called the median, runs up by the anterior margin of the supinator, then, more inward, in the direction of the flexor radialis, proceeding toward the middle of the elbow joint, or tendon of the biceps, on which it divides into two; the innermost, called the median basilic, runs upward, and inward, to join the basilic; the outermost, or median cephalic, runs up by the outer margin of the tendon of the biceps, meets the cephalic about an inch above the joint, and forms the common cephalic, which proceeds by the outer margin of the muscle, or sometimes a little on its face, till it reach the insertion of the pectoral muscle, where it continues on, between it and the deltoid, till it dip to the subclavian. The median cephalic, and perhaps the very commencement of the common cephalic, lie on, or cover the external cuta- neous nerve, where it comes out from beneath the biceps. Both veins, like the other subcutaneous ones, are under the superficial fascia, but the cephalic, in the fore-arm, is some- times under a deeper layer. The Basilic, is the continuation of the superficial ulnar. This, formed from a vein at the margin of the little finger, increased by additions from the ulnar division of the median, ascends by the back of the ulna, from which it winds forward, at about a handbreadth below the inner condyle, over the front of which, or rather the origin of the pronator, and flexor radialis, it passes obliquely upward and outward, mid- way between the intermuscular ligament, and tendon of the

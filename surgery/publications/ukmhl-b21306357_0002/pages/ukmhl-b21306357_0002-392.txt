372 aponeurosis of the forearm, is lost in its upper, and that of the hand, proceeds from its lower margin, so that it is not quite well defined. It rises from the styloid process of the radius, and from the ridge on the margin of that bone, for more than half an inch up, and crosses to the extremity of the ulna, and its styloid process, and obliquely round, to the pisiform bone. It is also connected to the cuneiform bone. It is not free, from one end to the other, like the anterior liga- ment, but it adheres to, or rises from, the ridge on the side of the radius, and, in its course to the ulna, it is fixed to a knob, about the middle of the back of the radius. This is slightly hollowed, so that the ligament adheres to its borders, leaving a small channel between them, through which passes the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, which afterwards, in its course outward, crosses obliquely the ten- dons of the extensores carpi. Going, radially, from this knob, we are carried back to the lateral ridge on the radius, and, in the intervening space, we have the tendons of the extensores radiales, the longior, or largest, being outermost, but, both have their own synovial sheaths. We may next trace the ligament outward, from the ridge, so as to stretch over the extensores primi internodii, and ossis metacarpi, each of which has its separate groove. It is connected with the aponeurosis in front, and also with the ext. lateral ligament, and often the ' origin of the abductor pollicis. The portion which extends from the knob to the ulna, first covers, or binds down, the tendons of the extensores diffitorum. It next forms a small channel, for the tendon of the extensor minimi digiti, and still more ulnar, a larger onej for that of the extensor carpi ulnaris. Then, besides being implanted into the ulna, it is identified with the aponeurosis, vvhicli is strong, on the back of the ulna, turns round to the aponeurosis in front, and, also, is connected by dense cellular substance, to the lateral ligament. The anterior carpal ligament is thick, strong, more than half an inch broad, and not much less than an inch long. The one end is firmly attached to the trapezium, and expands over its face, identified at its end, with the capsule of the

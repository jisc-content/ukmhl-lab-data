198 exactly in contact. By position, we relax the muscles, but must take care, that we do not preserve the position so long, as to favour permanent contraction. Wounds inflicted, with force, so as to cut down to the sides of the vertebrae, seem oftener to produce feebleness of the limbs by concussion, than actual palsy, unless some nerve have been divided. If the shock to the medulla be greater, or if it bave been, in any degree, injured or pricked, we may have tetanic spasm, or the patient falls down quite powerless, and perhaps devoid of feeling below the head. In some cases he recovers, slowly, the power of motion, but not of feeling, or, along with numb- ness, he is unable, from pain, to press his foot against the ground. If recovery take place, it seems rather by time, and attention to tbe general health, than by the use of issues, blis- ters, 8tc., though these ought not to be neglected after the wound has healed. CHAP II. OF THE ANATOMY OF THE HEAD. Before proceeding to the anatomy of the face, it may be well to consider that of the tongue and salivary glands. Some remarks on the former, and the muscles going to it, will be found at page 55, but by a strange mistake, the muscles have been transposed. I have, however, observed the confusion in time to correct it, both here, and in the errata. The tongue when laid out, on a table, measures about three inches and a half in length, but in situ it is curved or bends down at the base, toward the os hyoides, so that it is then, about three quarters of an inch shorter. It begins to bend down, about an inch and a quarter before the epiglottis, and the surface of all this curving portion is follicular, whilst that of the rest is papillary. The posterior pillar of the fauces, is

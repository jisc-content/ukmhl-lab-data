310 should expect the under surface, or that of tlie shaft, to be more directly applied, if the elbow were kept a little from the side. But if this be done, we must take care that the end of the shaft, be not, thereby, directed inward to the axilla. In Amputation at the joint, by the double flap, anterior and posterior, these meet, or commence, at the point of the acro- mion, unless a part of that process is to be sawed off, in which case, they begin farther back, on its top or surface. The more superficial parts divided, are, before, the pectoralis major, and anterior and upper part, of the deltoid; behind, the latissi- mus dorsi, teres major, and long head of the triceps, with the posterior and upper part of the deltoid. Deeper, the anterior incision, comprehends, before, the coraco-brachialis, and biceps; behind, the subscapularis, teres minor, and spinati muscles. The more superficial vessels divided, are the cephalic vein, thoracica humeraria, and branches of the supra- scapularis; the deeper, are the two circumflex arteries, the anterior comparatively small, and generally higher on the bone. If we cut from within, outward, we begin the disarticula- tion of the bone, by raising tbe arm a little, and rolling it outward, to stretch the tendon of the subscapularis, which we divide, without opening the artery or veins which are farther back. Then, bringing the arm pretty close by the side, we continue the sweep outward, introducing the knife a little under the acromion, and coraco-acromial ligament, and imme- diately turning its edge perpendicularly, or, we at once place it so, close by the process, and margin of the ligament, toward the head of the bone, on which we firmly cut, dividing, first, the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps, then, the long head, and next the supra-spinatus. Rolling and turn- ing the arm a little inward, we, on the back part, divide the infra-spinatus and teres minor, and corresponding part of the capsule; we now draw the bone a little downward, keeping it also inward, and immediately introduce the knife, between the glenoid cavity and head of the bone, and divide the ves- sels, nerves, and any other parts â– which may not have been com- pletely cut. We may modify these steps, in so far, as to be-

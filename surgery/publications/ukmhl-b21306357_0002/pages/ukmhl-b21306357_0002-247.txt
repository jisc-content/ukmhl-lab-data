the floor; but, if the excrescence spring, as is more frequent, from the mitlclle bone, it is evident that no instrument can be applied along its margin, unless it be curved, so as to enable the operator to run it back, in a line with the lower margin of the nasal bones. Even then, it can only grasp that part, which proceeds from the lower edge of the bone. It is still worse, when the polypusis connectedwith the highest bone. Whoever looks at the position of these bones, even in the dried skull, and the relations of a polypus, must at once be convinced, that its eradication, by any plan whatever, is rather to be de- sired than promised, and the rapid reappearance of polypi, after the nostril has been conjectured to be cleared, is easily explain- ed, by an excrescence expanding from a spot, where it had been confined, by the portion removed. The destruction of bone, and dreadful spreading of the disease, may also be readily understood. It sometimes destroys the nasal bones, form- ing an external tumour, enters into the antra, and swells the face laterally, as well as in front, penetrates into the frontal and sphenoidal cells, swelling the forehead, and press- ing on the brain, protrudes the eyes, and pushes forward the conjunctiva, descends into the pharynx, encroaches on the palate, and, perhaps, carries the velum forward, almost, to the front teeth. The Lachrymal Duct, opens into the nostril, below the infe- rior spongy bone, about three-eighths of an inch back from its very end; or, the oblique line from the lower end of the ante- rior naris, to the orifice of the duct, will be about an inch and an eighth, and its direction is such, that a probe intro- duced into the sac, and kept as close to the frontal bone as possible, would go downward, and obliquely backward, into the nose, in a line to the palate, over the root of the foremost grinder, near an inch and a half back from the front of the maxillary bone, at the root of the septum naris. We may introduce a probe into the duct from the nose, by bending it for two inches at the end, somewhat like a tenaculum, and passing it under the spongy bone, and directing it upward at the point mentioned. If the opening be not at once found, by moving it backward and forward, a very little way, it will

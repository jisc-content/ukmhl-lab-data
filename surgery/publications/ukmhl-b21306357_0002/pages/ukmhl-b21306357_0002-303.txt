283 simplest idea tliat can be given, is to say, that from the ser- ratus, on the thoracic side, we trace a lining, more or less firm and distinct, up to the top of the axillary cavity at the clavi- cle, and thence reflected down on the subscapularis, pector- ales, and muscles at the humerus. But this would, if quite correct, prevent the vessels and nerves from entering. I must, therefore, in so far, modify it, as to explain, that where these pass below the clavicle, the fiiscia is not complete, but turns down with them, and over them, so as to form a general sheath, besides prolongations, with the particular branches, more or_^less distinct. These still, it is to be observed, shut up the axilla, but if we tear or cut the reflection, at the ves- sels, then, we can, along these, convey within this sheath, the finger up into the neck. Probably, on dissecting the parts, it may appear, that no fascia intervenes between the vessels and thorax, the connexion being altogether cellular. But more attentive examination, will show that the cellular sub- stance is between the fascia of the serratus, and a thin cover- ing over the vessels, &c. In this cellular tissue, which is loose and extensible, we have glands, branches of nerves, and vascular branches, and it also is evident, that in opening the axilla, we shall, easily, separate the great cord of vessels and nerves, from the thorax and serratus; but, being firmly con- nected to the subscapularis, and muscles at the head of the humerus, we cannot, without cutting the stronger investing fascia there, and doing violence to the whole structure, sep- arate them in that direction. Lastly, we recollect, that the ex- ternal fascia of the armpit, goes down along the arm, and there- fore, the vessels and nerves, pass down beneath it, as in a sheath, without piercing any part. We may reverse the mat- ter, and trace the deep fascia, up fiâ€™om the coraco-brachieus, and other muscles of the arm, over the tendon and body of the subscapularis, between these and the vessels, up to the clavicle, and then down, to be identified with, or lost in the fascia of the serratus and pectoralis minor, and along the tract of the vessels, forming a kind of sheath for them. Now, this IS not useless minuteness; for, it explains how, in a puncture of the axillary artery, the blood must be confined within the

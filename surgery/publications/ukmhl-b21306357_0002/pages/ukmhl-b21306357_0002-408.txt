388 by the back of the wrist. 1 lie back of the liancl is supplied with nerves by, First, the external cutaneous, which, about the middle of the forearm, divides into two. One, goes down by the outer margin of the tendon of the flexor radialis, to the front of the radial side of the wrist, and sometimes to the ball of the thumb. Another, more outward, descends behind the cephalic vein, and either joins the superficial branch of the radial nerve, or also sends branches to the back of the wrist. Second, the superficial branch of the radial nerve, after coming out from behind the tendon of the supinator, about two inches and a half, or in long arms more, above the wrist, divides into two different branches. The anterior, runs on the margin of the fore-arm, directly down by the front of the tendon of the extensor metacarpi pollicis, along the outer side of the thumb, and to the ball. The posterior, runs a little behind the anterior, to the space between the articulation of the metacarpal bones of the thumb and index. It crosses the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii, runs behind it on the abductor indicis, and gives branches to the thumb and fore-finger: other branches also run on the back of the hand, more ulnar. Third, the posterior interosseus runs deep also on the back of the radius, under the annular liga- ment, where it swells like a long ganglion, from which branches almost like a plexus go off to the bursae. If any pass down farther to the back of the hand, they must be very small. The ganglion adheres strongly to the radius, and partly to the capsule. Fourth, the dorsal branch of the ulnar, comes out, perhaps, an inch and a half above the widst, and rather on the side of the ulna, covered by the flexor ulnaris. It, at the end of the ulna, gives off small twigs, which cross the back of the carpus, and immediately split into considerable branches for-the little, the ring, and ulnar side of the mid finger. These run down the sides of the fingers, as posterior digital branches. In front, the median nerve sends off, above the wrist, the superficial palmar, which goes on the face of the carpal ligament to the palm. The anterior interossei are supplied partly by the median, but principally by the ulnar nerve. This last also goes to

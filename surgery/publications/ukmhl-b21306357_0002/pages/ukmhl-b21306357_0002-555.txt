535 and have no difficulty in completing the separation. We adhere to the former rule of keeping close by the tibialis down to the ligament. The extensor pollicis is variable, in the height of its origin, arising, sometimes, as high as little more than three inches below the head of the fibula. We must therefore attend to the rule of keeping close by the surface of the tibialis, otherwise we may get on the wrong side of the extensor pollicis. If the extensor rise lower, the rule is still good. As the artery is very deep, the operation is more severe than at the lower part of the leg, and is not very likely to be often resorted to.

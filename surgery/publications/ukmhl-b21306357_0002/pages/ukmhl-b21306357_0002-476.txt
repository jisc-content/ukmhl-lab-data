456 stricture, without opening the herniary sac; but this has been restricted to large hernije. When the hernia descends into the sheath of the vessels, it is first by the inside of the vein, and then partly on its face. I do not know any peculiarity in the operation; for, though the herniary sac be in contact with the vein, yet we have no occasion to go exterior to it, and expose that vessel. Femoral hernia may curl over the top of the falciform process and the edge of Poupart’s ligament, so as to re- semble ventro-inguinal hernia. It may also lacerate, or burst through, the crural sac, so as to be divided into two tumours, or to assume a nodulated appearance. CHAP. V. OF THE ANATOMY OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. When we look at the front of the thigh, after the muscles are dissected, we observe, that, at the very top, the Tensor and Sartorius bound the outside. At the inside, we have the marginal line, formed by the Gracilis. Outward from this, is the Adductor Longus, and then the Pectineus. Between the outer and inner set, we have, in front, the Iliacus and Psoas. About a hand’s breadth below Pou- part’s ligament, we see the Rectus coming out from between the tensor and sartorius, forming the anterior line of the thigh, and obliquely crossed by the superficial muscle, the sartorius. On the outside, between the tensor and rectus, the Vastus Externus appears, and is continued down to the patella and knee. On the inside, from the adductor longus, downward, we see, in like manner, the Vastus Internus. If, having removed the sartorius, we cut across the rectus, and turn it down, we find, that we cannot displace it farther

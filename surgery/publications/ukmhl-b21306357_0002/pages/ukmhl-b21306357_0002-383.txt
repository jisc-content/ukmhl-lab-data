363 two brfiDcli6S) ori6j goes directly down to the side of the root of the thumb, and subdivides into a branch for each side; another, goes by the back of the thumb, and is distributed to the fore and radial side of the mid finger. The radial nerve meets the artery a little below the joint, or about the junction of the flexor radialis and supinator. It continues by the radial side of the artery, but not in contact with it, for half way down the fore-arm, there being a space of a quarter of an inch between them. This branch, then, is a cutaneous nerve. The other, or Deep division, gives off, im- mediately, small branches to the supinator longus and exten- sores radiales, and then it winds back, deeply, on the head of the radius, and the inner surface of the extensor brevior, between it and the supinator brevis, into the upper and outer part of which it enters, along with a small artery from the recurrens radialis, which continues to accompany it in the substance of this muscle. The nerve, winding backward and downward, comes out, behind, at the under margin of the supinator brevis, and attaches itself to the radial margin of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, running between it and the extensor metacarpi pollicis and primi internodii, and having given branches to them, and the extensors of the fingers and extensor ulharis, it sends a long branch, called the posterior interosseus, down, passing under the annular ligament, to the upper part of the back of the hand. The continuation of the posterior interossea, accompanies this, by its ulnar side. The Ulnar nerve winds forward, from behind the condyle to the fore-arm, between the heads of the flexor ulnaris, and then runs down straight to the wrist, on the flexor pro- fundus, covered by the flexor ulnaris, and in a kind of channel between them. The artery, winding a little inward, meets the nerve fully three inches below the joint, and, rather higher than midway down, they are in pretty close contact, the nerve to the ulnar side of the artery. Both pass under the strong aponeurosis, but above, or on the surface of the carpal ligament, by the radial side of the tendon of the flexor ulnaris, the nerve partly to the ulnar side of, partly covered

THE PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. CHAP. I. OF THE ANATOMY OF THE NECK. It is impossible, without much repetition, and even consider- able obscurity, to give a description of the component parts of small divisions of the body, and the exact relative situation of these parts. It appears to me, that the least objectionable plan I can follow, is to give a view seriatem of the different parts composing a natural division of the body; for instance, the neck, fi*om the clavicle to the os hyoides, and then connect these, and if necessary, subdivide them into smaller compart- ments. My object, in this work, is to give an account both of the exact course and direction of individual muscles, vessels, &c. and of the relation of one part to another, whereby a surgeon may have a twofold assistance in studying a case, and planning an operation. • In attempting this, I take it for granted that the reader is well acquainted with common anatomy, or con- sults, along with this, the ordinary systems, for details which are here omitted. Tlie bones, form fixed and primary stations in the topo- graphy of the neck, whence we may ti’ace those lines which serve to subdivide it into smaller and well defined portions. Tliese lines are the muscles, which are not only valuable to

135 quence of this is, that often when they swell they are prevented from enlarging outward, but are bound down, and extend more laterally, and involve important parts. A tumour begin- ning in an individual gland, and remaining apparently con- fined to it for a long time, may presently interest others, and at last, many and large glands, more or less distinct, and more or less moveable, enlarge, and disfigure the neck, or, one extensive and confused mass, may extend from the jaw to the clavicle, or, an individual gland may so increase as to occupy all that space, and either produce merely inconvenience from its shape, or more formidable evils from pressure on the larynx, trachea, or oesophagus, or give rise to mortal disorder of the general system. Even the more innocent or less suspi- cious tumours, known or supposed to be of a scrofulous nature, or, perhaps, distinctly arising from the absorption of acrid matter, are not free from hazard. They may suppurate extensively and protractedly, or by involving nerves, they produce pain or heat, and prickling or numbness of the shoulder or arm, or they, when not only pressing on one or more nerves, but also partially inflamed, may produce much pain in the head and neck, or stiffness and rigidity of the muscles, or wry neck, which may not be easily cured. We have seen that they are intimately connected with the jugular vein, and yet they seldomer produce obstruction to the return of the blood than might be expected; but when those at the upper part of that vessel inflame more acutely, the inflamma- tion may be communicated to the vein, and death, preceded by coma, be speedily produced, and thus, a man supposed to be in no danger to-day, or at most believed to have a curable fever, may be dead to-morrow. The glands, then, in every point of view, are of much importance, and their acute inflammation should be promptly attacked, and even their more chronic enlargement, especially in adults, must not be neglected. It would indeed be a cruel and unjustifiable course to cut out, in every instance, an enlarged gland, but, on the other hand, where, especially in adults, the tumour has been of considerable, perhaps long duration, and is tending to increase, it surely ought to be removed. It is well known

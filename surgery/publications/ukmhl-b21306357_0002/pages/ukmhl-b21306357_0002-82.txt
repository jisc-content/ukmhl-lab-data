62 mastoid muscle, we find not only one layer of this fascia going backward over the muscle, and forward over the throat, but another plunging deeper under the muscle. At that fold, called the ligament of the angle of the jaw, we find that an inner layer of thin fascia passes forward toward the os hyoides, and is lost in, or incorporated with, the myloid fascia, whilst another goes backward under the mastoid muscle, and adheres to the myloid fascia, at the border of the descending portion of the parotid gland. Prosecuting the examination of the platysmal fascia lower, we find at the anterior margin of the mastoid muscle, its inner layer or prolongation, in like n\anner passing forward over the vessels, toward the cylinder of the larynx and trachea, and becoming lost there in the myloid fascia; whilst behind, we find it extending backward towards the transverse processes of the vertebrse, covering the cervical plexus, levator scapulm, and scaleni, and pertaining rather to those parts, than to the under surface of the mastoid. When we merely divide the outer layer along the margin of the muscle, and pull up the fascia from below, we see more distinctly the spreading backward and forward of the fascia, and render more visible and evident, an angle which always exists at this line, between the two divarications of the fascia; in which angle we have a number of glands lodged, running parallel to the carotid artery on its outer margin. Different prolongations of this are traceable, and the description would vary in different subjects, from the different degrees of dis- tinctness. There is often not merely the layer shelving back over the levator, &c.; but a thin layer is reflected near the posterior margin of the mastoid, forward along its under surface, so that when the muscle is turned back, as we would open a book, we find two leaves of fascia displayed, with the vessels lying in the angle. To proceed with the anterior leaf, we find that it not only passes over the great vessels, and is lost in the sterno-thyroid fascia, but it also passes under them; one thin detachment passes all the way under them, to the oeso- phagus, which it assists in fixing down, and thence, as well as from the sides of the pharynx, it is lost in the fascia of the trachea and laryngeal cartilages. Another layer stops short

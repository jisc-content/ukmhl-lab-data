SG6 ramus of the external cutaneous nerve, by its ulnar, and one of the radial nerve, on its radial side. In this region, if the flexor radialis and supinator, be a little more distant than usual from each other, the artery is covered only by skin and fascia. In the Middle third of the fore-arm, we take the ulnar margin of the supinator for our guide, or go only a very little inward from its line, which, in this district, is from the outer margin of the tendon of the biceps, to the front of the side of the radius, or the side of the root of the thumb. The median vein, runs nearly in that track with the largest division of the external cutaneous nerve, close by it, generally on its radial margin, if not covered by it. The cephalic vein winds, from behind, to the front of the radius, at about four inches above the wrist, and runs up on the supinator, more or less near its margin, but too much outward to be endanfiered. Avoiding the median vein and the cutaneous nerve, we have, in this district, still another nerve, the super- ficial branch of the radial, to attend to. This is overlapped by the supinator, and when the margin of this, is carefully separated, from its connexion with the flexor radialis, and pressed outward, this nerve is either pressed with it, or, if not, it is seen more outward than the artery, and usually in no danger, if the needle be not pushed from within out- ward, to a very unnecessary extent. At the same time, it must be remembered, that in a few instances, the artery is nearer the nerve, and more superficial. The artery is on the flexor pollicis, covered by a thin layer of fascia, and must be detached from the venae comites. In the Upper third, we still take the supinator for our guide, unless very near the joint indeed. The line of the margin, so high as this, is, however, a little different from the rest, owing to the bulging of its belly. It is traversed by a thread, drawn from the outside of the biceps tendon, to the pisiform bone. The median vein is to the ulnar side of the incision, but a communicating branch between it and the cephalic, is likely to come in the way. The supinator over- laps the artery, and must be pressed outward. The nerve is

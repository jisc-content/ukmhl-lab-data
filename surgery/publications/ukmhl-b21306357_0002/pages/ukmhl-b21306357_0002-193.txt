173 goes, those glands between the artery and the larynx and trachea are frequently enlarged, but in every district they may swell either individually or collectively. Tumours thus formed are most serious, and if they do not evidently tend to suppuration, ought never to be allowed to remain, if they can possibly be extirpated. The consequence of delay too often is, that an extension of the disease takes place, so that it passes to the other side, or at least involves the thyroid gland- The tumour enlarges upward and downward, and becomes so connected with the vessels and nerves, that they may be said actually to pass through it. In such a state, it would be wrong to attempt an operation, for we should require to expose the neck from the clavicle to the base of the skull, to tie the carotid artery not only below, but very high above, to pre- vent retrograde haemorrhage; the jugular vein must be tied; and we have to meet all the consequences resulting from the division of the eighth pair of nerves and the sympathetic. The ligature of the carotid artery is not so free from danger as many suppose; and yet it is, I believe, not only the least troublesome, but also the safest part of such an operation. Whenever, then, we find a tumour penetrating deep, and particularly when it moves with difficulty, being firmly at- tached to the parts below, we must, in general, decline an operation; and the rule is absolute if the tumour be extensive. The firmness of the fixture is not owing to the tension of the fascia, for no position can affect it. It is from its attachment to the cervical muscles, to the thyroid gland, and to its con- nexion with the jaw, and possibly the base of the skull. The danger, which would be great in such a case, from the ex- haustion attendant on the operation, from the certainty, that if the artery and vein both required to be tied, the nerve could hardly expect to escape, and from the extent of wound which lequired to be healed, would, if it were possible for it to be increased, be rendered still greater, if the skin so adhered to the tumour, or were so diseased as to oblige us to remove so much as should prevent us from covering the wound. If the extirpation of a tumour, dipping deeply, be resolved on, from its being somewhat moveable, and neither reaching

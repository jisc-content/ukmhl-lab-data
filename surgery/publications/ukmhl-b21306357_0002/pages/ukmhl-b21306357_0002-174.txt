154 arises from the middle ganglion, and passes down on the face of the subclavian, in the angle formed by it and the cax’otid; then by the outer margin of the innominata to the cardiac plexus, behind the arch of the aorta. More frequently it arises, pi’operly speaking, from the superior ganglion, as I have described, receives an addition from the middle ganglion, then passes down beliind the subclavian, in a line with the outer margin of the carotid, and, just at the lower margin of the subclavian, it joins the cardiac branch of the eighth, which passes down in front, in the angle between the two vessels, in the place assigned by many eminent anatomists for the great cardiac nerve. The junction being formed by these two nerves, and additions received from the convexity of the recurrent, the great cardiac goes on by the outer margin of the innominata to the cardiac plexus. In some instances, a small branch of the sympathetic, all we have for the middle or great cardiac, passes down in the angle, and then unites with the cardiac branch of the eighth, or these two join before reaching the subclavian, and pass down in the angle. The inferior ganglion sends off inward and downward, a number of twigs which interlace like a plexus, from which issues a nerve that runs near the recurrent nerve, and connected with it by interlacements. It is the Inferior cardiac nerve, and goes obliquely under the great cardiac, on by the outside of the innominata, toward the face of the aorta, close on its sub- stance, to the anterior coronary plexus. But this, like the other cardiac nerves, is not very regular, for it may come olF from the middle ganglion, and only receive additional branches from the inferior ganglion and recurrent, or it may be a branch of the great cardiac, with the aid of these addi- tions, passing individually as slender branches over the aorta. The subclavian artery and the innominata, and often the root of the carotid, are covered with filaments of the nerve, and sometimes twigs of considerable size spread over these. We must, therefore, in the operation of tying the innominata or carotid, be particularly careful to have the sheath fairly opened. The cardiac plexus is a broad and pretty extensive sheet of

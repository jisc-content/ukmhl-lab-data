221 longation being a cyst, or capsulated, or on some favourable circumstance, which there was no warrant to calculate on. There are two directions, in which the tumour may extend, so as to add much to the danger, namely, toward the pharynx, glottis, and mouth, and, in this case, we have to consider, not only whether we can by dint of cutting, take all away, but also whether the patient could long survive the injury done; or, it may go down the neck, and, setting all other parts out of the question, if, along with the carotid, we must inevita- bly cut the internal jugular vein, pneumogastric nerve, and perhaps the sympathetic, the patient could not survive above a few hours at the most.* When the tumour is more strictly confined to the parotid region, I remark, that the seat of the greatest danger, is generally below the digastric muscle, for, there, the tumour is only separated from the internal jugular vein, and other important parts, by a fascia, and if the conglobate glands be swelled, there is even more risk here, than if the parotid alone were enlarged. From the lower margin of the digastric, to the styloid process, a thick layer of muscles is interposed, and above the process, the dissection is indeed deep, but not more hazardous, if means be taken to control haemorrhage. This leads me, then, to consider the question, whether the vessels should be tied, as they are cut, or the common carotid artery be secured, as a preliminary step. It may be said, that it would be better to begin, by tying the external carotid, more especially as this could be done without extending the incision beyond the limits necessary for the removal of the tumour, and might be accomplished in the early stage of the dissection, by raising the lobe of the gland; in doing which, by the bye, we must be prepared for haemorrhage, from the divided posterior facial vein. But it is only in particular cases, that the lower part of the tumour is in a favourable state for this, and gen- erally, I should prefer tying the common carotid. Even then, the operation is not bloodless, for the retrograde circu- The reader raay connect with these remarks, those made, at pages 164, and 184 to 186.

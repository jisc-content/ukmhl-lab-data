131 they form a very considerable plexus on the front of the tra- chea; and in wounds here, it should be remembered, that there is not only the more superficial plexus already described on the surface of the sterno-hyoideus, but this more important congeries of veins below the sterno-thyroideus. The right vein comes down in front of the arteria innominata, and before the eighth nerve, and enters the vena cava, where it gives off the right subclavian. The left enters the left subclavian. It is farther to be remembered, that the two anterior jugular veins often communicate by a transverse branch running over the sterno-hyodei, just above the sternum, and this may be wounded in making an incision here. As there is an arteria innominata, so is there a correspond- ing vein. The trunk formed by the union of the right sub- clavian and internal jugular veins, passes down alongside of the artery, and is called by some the right vena innominata; whilst the left, formed by the subclavian and jugular vein of the opposite side, is much longer, and passes somewhat hori- zontally across the root of the artery, which runs at a variable depth, generally about half an inch, though sometimes a little more, below the margin of the sternum. It ascends at the median line, and its course is obliquely to the right sterno- clavicular articulation, where it subdivides. The length between this subdivision, and the upper margin of the vein, is about five- eighths of an inch; but this extent of artery is not always un- covered by veins, for, often, on the outside of the sterno-hyoidei muscles, a transverse vein of considerable size runs from one external jugular to another, parallel to, and just above the margin of the sternum; whilst under the muscles covering the trachea and the artery, we have the large inferior thyroid vein, sometimes ascending directly from the vena innominata, some- times obliquely from the jugular or subclavian. Occasionally, the anterior external jugular vein, winds under the margin of the mastoid muscle, an inch or more above the clavicle, and runs along the under surface of that muscle, to get to the internal jugular or subclavian; and if care be not taken, it may be injured in exposing the bifurcation of the artery, when a liga- ture is to be applied to the innominata.

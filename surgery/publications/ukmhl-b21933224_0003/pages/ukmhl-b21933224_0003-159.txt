139 FRACTURES OF THE PATELLA. assistant, while the limb is fully extended, great care being taken to see that the two cartilaginous surfaces are in accurate apposition. . The wire is then bent up so as to completely approximate the bony surfaces, and a couple of twists are made in it so as to fix the fragments firmly in position (see Fig. 56). The ends of the wire are cut off by cutting pliers, Fig. 56.—Wiring the Patella. Tiuisiing the ivire. The limb is straightened, the wire pulled taut and twisted. The rent in the capsule is then stitched up, and the flap replaced and sutured. leaving about a quarter of an inch beyond the twist, and with a small hammer the ends are hammered down so that there is no projection on the surface of the bone. In some cases a vertical fracture of the lower fragment is met with in addition to the transverse one; under such circumstances the surgeon should begin by uniting the two halves of the lower frag- ment by means of medium sized silver wire, and then the fragment thus united is secured to the upper one by means of two vertical wires instead of one, one being employed for each half of the lower fragment (see Fig. 57).

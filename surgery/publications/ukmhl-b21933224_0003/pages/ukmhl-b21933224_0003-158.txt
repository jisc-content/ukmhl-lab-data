13S THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. of the fragment just at the attachment of the ligamentum patellae. At the point where the drill emerges, the parts are again divided vertically, and the edges of the incision are caught and held aside with catch forceps (see Fig. 54). The drill is then removed, and the lower end of the wire is pushed through the aperture in the fractured surface and made to emerge between the forceps; in order to facilitate the passage of the wire at this stage, the knee should be flexed to increase the gap between the fragments and a good long loop of the wire pulled out between them (see Fig. 55). This method of drilling the lower fragment from the fractured surface downwards and forwards to the anterior surface is much Fig. 55.—Wiring the Patella. Passing the -,vh-e. The knee is well bent and a long loop of the wire is pulled out and the lower end passed through the lower fragment from the fractured surface. preferable to that often adopted of drilling upwards and backwards from the anterior surface and making the point of the drill emerge on the fractured surface, as in drilling the upper fragment. By the method we describe it is much easier to ensure the correspondence of the two drill holes on the fractured surfaces; a point of vital importance in securing accurate apposition and a good functional result. Fastening the wire.—The wire is then seized with strong forceps and a sufficient portion is pulled through and straightened by pulling firmly upon its two ends. Having seen that the surface of the fracture is clean, the wire is held quite taut, and the fragments are pushed together over it by an

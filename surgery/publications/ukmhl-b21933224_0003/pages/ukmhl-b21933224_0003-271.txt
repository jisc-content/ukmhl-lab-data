251 AMPUTATIONS OF THE FINGERS. osteo-myelitis and the like, and under these circumstances it is often possible to remove the metacarpal and to leave the finger intact. This will give in place of the metacarpal a firm cicatrix which is generally sufficient to give satisfactory support to the finger, the only alteration being that the latter is somewhat drawn up between the heads of the metacarpals on either side, so that there is apparent shortening. The operation may be done through a dorsal incision extending the whole length of the metacarpal bone. It should commence well above the base and diverge a little to each side opposite the knuckle (see Fig- 79); the incision should only go through the skin, and the extensor tendon should be pulled aside and carefully preserved. If the amputation be done for any other affection than tumour or periosteal disease, Fig. 75.â€”Ami'Otation of a Metacarpal Bone Alone. The diagram shows the best incision. The upper transverse dotted incision is not .ilways required. it is well to strip the periosteum off on either side and preserve it. The ligaments connecting the base of the metacarpal with the bases of the adjacent bones are then divided by a narrow-bladed knife inserted in the interosseous spaces with the edge upwards. The dorsal and the carpo- metacarpal ligaments are next put on the stretch and divided with the point of the knife. The head of the bone is separated from the metacarpals on either side, the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation is opened, and the head of the bone seized with strong forceps and pulled forcibly backwards. This will allow the structures to be separated from the anterior surface of the bone right back to its base. The anterior carpo-metacarpal ligaments are then divided by the point of a narrow- bladed knife, the bone being twisted first to one side and then to the other. By operating in this manner there is no risk of injuring the structures in the palm.

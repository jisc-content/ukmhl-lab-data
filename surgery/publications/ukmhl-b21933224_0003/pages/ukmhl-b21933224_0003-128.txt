108 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. broken off, to excise it altogether, taking care to peel off the periosteum with the structures attached to it. It is well, however, not to have recourse to operative measures until the effusion about the fracture has become absorbed and until the damage done to the structures at the time of the accident has had time to become more or "less repaired. It is very likely that septic infection will occur in the wound as the result of its proximity to the anus, and in the damaged condition of the soft parts this might readily become very grave. Therefore for the first fortnight or three weeks persevering attempts should be made to replace the bone in position as often as it becomes displaced; if after that time it is obvious that they have failed, operative measures— through a median incision directly over the fragment—may be resorted to. The steps of the operation are quite simple; the incision goes down to the bone at once, the periosteum and fibrous structures are peeled back with a rugine as completely as possible, the fragment is seized in forceps and removed with a few touches of the point of the knife. The wound is sutured, and it is well to fasten the dressing in position by means of collodion. Should septic infection occur, the stitches should be re- moved, a drainage tube inserted, and wet boracic dressings (see Part I., p. 48) applied.

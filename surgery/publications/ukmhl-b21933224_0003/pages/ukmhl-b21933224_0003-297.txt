277 AMPUTATIONS OF THE FOOT. capable of bearing the entire weight and very easily fitted with an arti- ficial limb. The operation is performed as follows. The preliminary measures for disinfection, etc. recommended on p. 272, are attended to, and a tourniquet is applied around the lower third of the thigh. The patient lies upon his back with the foot projecting well over the end of the table and held by an assistant strictly at right angles. The surgeon then marks out the base of his flap by placing the thumb ovei;^the tip of the external malleolus and the forefinger at a corresponding point upon the inner side Fig. 91.—Syme's Amputation. The thick lines denote the skin incisions which pass direct from one side to a corresponding point on the other. The dotted line is the level of the bone section when the joint is healthy ; should there be disease of it, the section will be entirely above the articular cartilage. • of the foot; that is to say, about half an inch below and a little behind the tip of the internal malleolus. These two points are then connected by an incision carried vertically downwards across the sole which goes right down to the bone. It is important that this incision should run vertically down- wards and transversely across the sole from one point to the other (see Fig. 91). Should it be made to slope at all forwards into the sole, Fic. 92.—Svme's " Foot-Knife." great difificulty will be experienced during the later stages of the operation in dissecting back the flap. On the other hand should it be made to slope backwards towards the point of the heel, the flap will probably be insufficient to cover the ends of the bones. This incision should be made by a stout knife often termed a " Syme's " or a " foot" knife (see Fig. 92), and when it has been carried down to the bone, the two

FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 121 Hodgen's splint.—Another and more satisfactory method is the use of Hodgen's splint (see Fig. 45)- 'I'h'^ i« ^'^'^^ follows :-A stirrup is applied to the limb (see p. 24), and the wire frame, of a size suitable for the particular case, is converted into a form of sling for the reception of the injured limb; this is done by fastening strips of stout flannel of suitable length and about three or four inches in width to one side of the frame; the latter is then placed in position over the limb and converted into a sling by bringing each strip of flannel in succession round beneath the limb and fastening the free end to the opposite side of the frame, in which r Fig. 45.—Hodgen's Splint. The limb is seen secured to the foot of tlie wire frame (the shape of which is shown separately in the small figure above) by means of a stirrup secured to the frame by a cord. The method of making the wire frame into a cradle or sling by means of strips of stout flannel is also indicated. These strips are stitched to one side of the frame and then brought round beneath the limb one by one and pinned to the opposite side. Two of these strips are seen unfastened in the figure. the limb thus lies comfortably. The upper and outer extremity of the wire frame should lie over the anterior superior iliac spine, while the upper and inner end is well up in the fold of the groin. The limb is fastened to the foot of the frame by a cord passing from the stirrup; the fracture is then carefully reduced and extension maintained by raising the whole splint with the limb, in it, and suspending it by means of properly arranged cords to an upright at the foot of the bed, which is so arranged that the limb is somewhat abducted and rotated outwards.

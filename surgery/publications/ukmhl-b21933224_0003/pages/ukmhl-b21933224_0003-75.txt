55 FRACTURES : (GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. carbolic solution or boiling them, and reapplying the apparatus before the patient is allowed to come round from the anassthetic. In these cases of ununited fracture complete union at the end of six weeks must not be looked for. As a rule it is necessary to keep the limb immobilised for three months or longer before thoroughly satisfactory union is obtained. (11) Inclusion of nerves in the callus.—The large nerves which run in grooves along or in close proximity to the bone may be surrounded by callus which, as ossification goes on, exerts considerable pressure upon them and gives rise to pain and to a certain amount of loss of function. This may require some operative interference for its relief. Treatment.—The treatment of this condition has already been referred to in dealing with affections of nerves (see Part II., p. 245). (12) Adhesion of muscles and tendons to the fractured ends.—As has been pointed out already, there is considerable damage to the soft parts in the neighbourhood of fractures, and as a result there may be extensive adhesion of tendons or muscles to the bones; it is important to take measures to prevent the resulting disability of the limb where this has occurred. Treatment.—The treatment of this condition has been dealt with in detail in discussing the question of massage in fractures (see p. 3c).

CHAPTER XVII. AMPUTATIONS IN THE LOWER EXTREMITY. AMPUTATIONS OF THE TOES. General considerations. —These operations may be called for under circumstances similar to those demanding amputation of the fingers, hut there is this great difference. between the two cases, that, whereas in the fingers it is important to preserve all the bone that can safely be retained, in the toes it is best to remove the entire phalanx instead of leaving part behind. With the exception of the great toe, a portion of a toe is of no use whatever to the patient; on the contrary it is likely to become drawn up, to press against the boot and to give rise to pain and ulceration. As long as the heads of the metatarsal bones are left and the tread of the foot is thus unimpaired, the loss of one or indeed several toes is a matter of no great importance. In the case of the great toe, however, the exact contrary is the case; through it a great portion of the weight of the body is transmitted to the ground and it is therefore important to save even a small portion of the first phalanx. But if this be done, it is essential that the tendons should be stitched to the periosteum or to the edge of the tendon sheaths in a manner similar to that described for removal of portions of the phalanges of the fingers (see p. 247). Methods of amputating.—The methods of amputation for the toes are absolutely identical with those for the fingers, and we need not therefore describe them again. The incisions are illustrated in Fig 88, A. It must be remembered that the metatarso-phalangeal joint is relatively higher above the web than the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and the articulation is not so easily made prominent by bending the toes as it is by bending the fingers. Removal of the metatarsal bones.—The metatarsal bone may also be removed along with its corresponding toe in a manner similar to that employed for the hand, by prolonging the handle of the racket-shaped in-

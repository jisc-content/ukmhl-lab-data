70 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. leather or guttapercha spUnts; poroplastic is sufficiently porous without them. Care should be taken to punch these holes from the inner surface, as if done in the reverse direction the points of the punctures will irritate the skin. After the splint has thoroughly hardened, it is padded and fixed to the shoulder by tapes attached to the upper part and passed under the opposite axilla; it is fastened around the arm by straps and buckles. A bandage may then be applied around the shoulder over all. B Fig. 27.—Shoulder-Cap for use in Fractures of the Humerus. A shows roughly a simple pattern suitable for a shoulder-cap. The arrangement is shown applied in B. The wrist-sling is placed beneath the shoulder-cap in older to obtain better fixation of the wrist. The splint is secured around the arm by a strap or bandage not shown in the figure. After-treatment—The apparatus should be kept on for at least a week without being disturbed, unless it causes pain from pressure, or unless it shifts its position. At the end of a week it may be taken down, the axilla and arm washed, and gentle passive movements made. In doing this, one hand in the axilla should grasp the region of the fracture while an assistant should steady the scapula. The fracture should then be put up again, and the apparatus ought not to be discontinued until about five 'weeks have elapsed. During the progress of the case the splint should be taken off at first once a week, but after the lapse of three weeks it should be removed daily for passive movement. Extension apparatus.—When the fracture does not keep in place satis- factorily after reduction, as may be the case when there is considerable obliquity or much comminution of the fragments, some arrangement must

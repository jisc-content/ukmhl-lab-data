270 AMPUTATIONS. After-treatment.—The wound should be sewn up with a large drainage tube inserted at its lower angle; a large gauze dressing is applied, with suitable sponge pressure over the flaps to prevent accumulation beneath them. The arm must be well pushed up against the acromion and supported by a suitable sling, a pad being placed in the axilla to throw the head of the bone away from the side. This support to the arm must be continued for three or four months after the wound has healed, so as to allow the parts to become consolidated before the weight of the limb is allowed to tell upon them. Passive movement of the upper extremity should be begun in about three weeks, when the patient should also attempt active movement. Results.—The results obtained are really extremely good, particularly when the acromion process is left. As a rule all underhand movements are perfect and the most complicated manipulations can be performed; overhand movement however is practically never regained.

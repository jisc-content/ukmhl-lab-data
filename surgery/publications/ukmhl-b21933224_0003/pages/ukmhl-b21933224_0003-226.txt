206 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. Operative.â€”Should the disease not yield readily to this treatment, the best plan is to cut down and remove as much of the thickened periosteum as possible, and at the same time to gouge away a portion of the thickened bone; in these cases it is not necessary to open up the medullary cavity. In cases of so-called " neuralgic osteitis," where the pain is intense and probably due to pressure on the nerves in the condensed bone and consequent neuritis, very free gouging of the affected portion is the only treatment that offers a satisfactory result. There is apparently very little thickening of the bone in these cases, but after the operation very marked improvement often follows. These operations are only permissible with strict asepsis.

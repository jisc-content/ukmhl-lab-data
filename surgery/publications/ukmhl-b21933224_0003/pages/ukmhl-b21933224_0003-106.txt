86 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. aside by forceps as recommended above. Otherwise, on attempting to introduce the wire through the first hole it may be very difificult to find the aperture in the bone, and when the end emerges from the second hole it may very easily become entangled in the fascia and may be pushed down the arm for a very considerable distance; the little manoeuvre just described obviates the possibility of this. During the passage of the wire the manipulations are much facilitated by fully flexing the elbow and so increasing the gap between the fragments. Fig. 34.â€”Operation for Wiring the Olecranon. Twisting the %uire. 'I'he lower figure shows the elbow joint extended fully and the fractured process pushed down in place by an assistant, as the wire is twisted. The upper figure represents diagrammatic- ally the direction of the wire and the manner in which it brings the fragments together when it is twisted. When the wire has been introduced, the elbow is extended, and traction is made on the two ends of the wire by grasping them in strong forceps, by which it is pulled quite straight; an assistant pushes the fractured surfaces together, brings them into accurate apposition and the wire is then bent round and twisted into two or three turns (see Fig. 34). The wire is cut off short and the ends are hammered down on to the bones with a small tack-hammer, so as to be completely buried in the fascia. The wound is sutured without a drainage tube and the usual antiseptic

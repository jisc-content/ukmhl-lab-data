CHAPTER XIII. RICKETS: SCURVY-RICKETS. RICKETS. Rickets may be defined as a disease of the period of growth associated with general disturbance of nutrition and characterised by alterations in the bony tissues and by deformities of the skeleton, as well as by various internal disorders. Cases occur where children are born with rickets (the so-called " foetal rickets"), but the disease generally commences during infancy, and begins to show its effects on the skeleton during and after the second year. In some cases, however, rickets first appears towards the age of puberty (" rachitis adolescentium "). ETIOLOGY.â€”The etiology of the disease is by no means clear, but, from the point of view of treatment, two theories only need be mentioned. The first is that the affection is due to injudicious feeding, particularly to too early weaning, accompanied by the administration of too much farinaceous, and too little albuminous food. It is supposed that the excess of farinaceous food leads to decomposition in the stomach, and consequent overloading of the blood with lactic or other acids; this is supposed to cause irritation of the nervous system, the lungs, the intestines, and the growing parts of the bones. The other view is that the disease is due essentially to imperfect oxygenation of the blood, and that excess of carbonic acid in the blood is the irritating agent. In support of this theory it is pointed out that patients with rickets are most numerous during the early summer, the disease having been set up as the result of confinement to the house during the winter, the effects of the confinement becoming manifest towards the end of the spring or the early part of the summer. Similarly the season of the year when rickets is least prevalent is towards the end of the year, the children having had plenty of fresh air and sunshine during the summer. Rickets mainly occurs in the children of the poor, who are not only imperfectly fed but are also closely confined

113 FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. Thotnas's hip splint.—hX. the end of ten or twelve weeks the hip joint should be fixed by means of a Thomas's hip splint (see Fig. 41), and the patient may then be allowed to get about upon crutches which should be used for at least two or three months before he puts the foot to the ground. If prolonged treatment of this kind be adopted, the union, even though it be fibrous, will gradually become so firm that the patient is able to support a considerable part of the weight upon the injured limb. In impacted fractures.—Here the long splint alone is often sufficient, but, as the impaction in these intra-capsular cases is often extremely slight, amounting sometimes to a mere entanglement of irregular fragments, it is Fig. 4t.—Thomas's Hip Splint. A shows the splint previous to use; the wings a surround the leg just below the knee, while those at b enclose the thigh just above it. The stout metal band c encircles the chest, and the splint is kept in place partly by bandages and parily by the braces d. B is the patten fastened to the boot on the sound side by the screw-plates e. The apparatus is shown applied in C, with ihe patient walking on crutches. as well to employ extension, at any rate after the end of the first ten days. It will not be necessary to use nearly as much weight as when the fracture is unimpacted; otherwise the impaction might easily be broken up. Two or three pounds usually suffice. (b) In elderly and feeble subjects.—Palliative.— In these patients it is not advisable to attempt to obtain bony, or even in many cases firm fibrous union. The patient should at first be kept in the recumbent position for a short time; sometimes he can be kept lying on his back for ten PT. HI. H

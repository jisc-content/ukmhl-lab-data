AMPUTATIONS. 226 THE MODIFIED CIRCULAR METHOD.—The circular method has been put aside in favour of what is termed the modified circular method, by which, in place of the circular division of the skin, two equal Fig. 66.—The Modified Circular Method of Amputation. The dotted line «c in A_ is the ordin.iry incision in the circular method, while the thick line aic shows the modified circular incision. The skin flaps are shown in A' as well as the circular division of the muscles. flaps of skin and subcutaneous tissue are cut,^ just slightly longer than the cuff of skin produced in the circular method just described. By dividing the skin in this manner, the division of the muscles is greatly Fig. 67.—RuGiNES or Periosteum Detachers. These are of different shapes according to the purposes for which they are used. The concave edge of the lowest of the three is for detaching the periosteum from a circular bone. facilitated, and there is no difficulty in the retraction of the skin flaps. After the flaps have been raised, the muscles are divided by a series of ' In the case of a fore-arm of ordinary size, the lower limit of the flaps will be about IJ inches below the seat of the circular division of the muscles, and this again about li' inches below the point of section of the bone. In the upper arm each of these measurements will be increased to 2^ inches or more.

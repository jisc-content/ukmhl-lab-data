FRACTURES: GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 17 tightly bandaged on there would be a risk of undue compression when they dried. The bandaging must be done rapidly, as otherwise the plaster will set before it is done, and the splint will not fit smoothly and evenly. It is of great importance not to impregnate the flannel with the plaster until everything is ready for immediate application of the splints, as it is generally found that, by the time the bandaging has been completed, the plaster is already fairly firm. After the splint has been applied, a hood of cotton-wool is put over the toes, and the limb left exposed upon the bed for two or three hours to dry thoroughly. Any rough edges, etc., of the splint either above or below should be trimmed off with strong scissors, before the plaster has thoroughly set. If there be no signs of undue pressure upon the limb, such as great pain, lividity or ancesthesia of the toes, the splint should be left untouched for twenty-four hours; at the end of this time the gap along the middle line of the front of the leg and the sole of the foot, which is merely covered by a few layers of muslin bandage, should be cut down with scissors, and the casing thus converted into two lateral splints hinged together behind by the muslin bandage. The fracture may thus be easily inspected, the limb being held in position in one half of the splint while the other Fig. d.â€”Method 0/examining a limb in a Croft's splint. 'I'hc limb is held steady in one half of the splint while the other is opened out. is turned back (see Fig. 6). The edges of the splint are then trimmed and it is reapplied by means of an ordinary bandage. In this condition it may be left until all danger of complications has passed, and then if desired it may easily be converted into an immovable plaster of Paris casing by applying an ordinary plaster of Paris bandage over the two lateral splints. * PT.

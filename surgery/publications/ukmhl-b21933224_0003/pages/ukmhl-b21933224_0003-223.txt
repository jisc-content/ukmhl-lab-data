CHAPTER XII. SYPHILITIC AND RHEUMATIC AFFECTIONS OF BONE. SYPHILIS OF BONE. Syphilitic affections of bone may occur in the secondary and tertiary periods of acquired syphilis, and also in the inherited form. The treatment is essentially that of syphilis itself, and we need only refer very shortly to the subject. IN SECONDARY SYPHILIS.—Accompanying the congestive con- ditions of the skin at quite an early period of the secondary stage of syphilis there may be pains in the bones of a rheumatic character, which are probably due to congestion, and do not leave behind any permanent lesion. But at a later period of syphilis, from the sixth month onwards, there is a definite form of bone lesion—syphilitic periostitis— which may ultimately lead to the formation of bony nodes. The bones most often affected in this way are the more superficial ones, such as the skull (especially the frontal bone), the ribs, the sternum, the tibia, and the clavicle. The patient has nocturnal pains in the part, especially when warm in bed, there is some swelling and tenderness, and the swelling, though limited to one part of the bone, may occasionally be of considerable size. If the part be examined in the early stages, the periosteum will be found thickened, and beneath its deeper layer there is an effusion of gelatinous material. If the condition be left untreated, ossification may take place and a permanent mass of bone be formed, which is termed a syphilitic node. If, however, the ordinary treatment of secondary syphilitis be employed at once, the thickening may disappear entirely. Treatment.—The patient should be put on mercury (see Part I., p. 232) and it is well to keep the part at rest and strapped with mercurial ointment. If there be much pain, evaporating lotions (see Part I., p. 8) may be used, or hot fomentations if the pain be very great; beyond this no local treatment is necessary.

SECTION II.—DISEASES OF BONES. CHAPTER IX. ACUTE AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF BONES. GROWING PAINS. URING the growing period, more especially between thirteen and sixteen years of age, young adults often complain of pains in bones and joints. These are due to a congestive condition of the medulla, chiefly in the neighbourhood of the epiphyses, and are popularly termed "growing pains." In some cases the pain may be severe, and accompanied by elevation of temperature, and the condition is frequently difficult to diagnose; it is very likely to be confounded with commencing joint trouble, or, on the other hand, commencing joint trouble may be mis- taken for "growing pains." The diagnosis is soon cleared up, however, because this condition passes off in the course of a few weeks if the patient be kept in bed; whereas commencing joint disease will not. Treatment.—As there is always a certain amount of difficulty in diagnosing this condition from commencing joint disease, or from tumours in the interior of bones, etc., it is better at first, if there be any doubt, not to express a definite opinion, but to treat the case as if it were one of these graver affections. The patient should be kept in bed, with the limb fixed on a splint. Fresh air, good food, and warmth are also desirable; quinine and alcohol in small quantities are sometimes good. If the case be one of simple congestion in connection with growth, the pain very soon passes off, and no swelling will appear. ACUTE INFLAiNIMATION OF BONE. In studying the inflammatory affections of bones it is necessary to consider not only the bone proper but also the periosteum and the medulla; thus we may speak of inflammation of the periosteum or periostitis, of

58 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. handkerchiefs are prepared much in the same way as for a perineal band. The handkerchiefs thus prepared are fastened loosely around each shoulder, passing beneath the axilla and over the point of the shoulder, and care is taken that they do not encroach upon the seat of fracture. The ends of the hand- kerchiefs are then tied firmly together between the scapulae; in this way the shoulders can be pulled back to any degree required. The axilla should be shaved or the hair cut quite short, and then powdered thickly over with boracic powder, and a pad of moderate size placed in it; the arm is supported by a large handkerchief sling which raises and pushes forward the elbow Fig. 20.—The Handkerchief Method kor treating Fractured Clavicle. The shoulders are well pulled b.nrk by the handkerchiefs looped aronnd them (compare also Fig. 21)1 a pad is placed in the axilla and the arm is supported by a large elbow sling— tied over the sound shoulder. The forearm is sometimes carried obliquely up across the front of the chest until the hand rests on the anterior fold of the opposite axilla ; this can be done by pinning the sling suitably. The apparatus is completed by the handkerchief encircling the thorax and binding the arm '.0 the .side. and is fastened round the neck, A third handkerchief, binding the arm to the side and passing around the trunk just above the level of the elbow, completes the apparatus (see Fig. 20). Extremely satisfactory results are obtained with this arrangement, but it is rather irksome because of the pressure of the knot in the middle of the back; this may be remedied to some extent by sewing the ends of the handkerchiefs together instead of knotting them. The mo.st satisfactory method is that illu.strated in Fig. 21. Here the shoulder loops are buckled together, and the tension can be

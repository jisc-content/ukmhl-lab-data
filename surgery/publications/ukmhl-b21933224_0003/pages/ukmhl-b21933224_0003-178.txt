THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. The splint should next be fastened to the leg by means of a bandage which does not extend as low as the seat of fracture. The inversion of the foot can then be readily effected by means of a handkerchief folded as just described, and carried horizontally round the ankle with its centre just above the inner malleolus. The ends of this bandage are crossed over the outer side of the instep and passed through the prongs of the splint; by pulling on them the foot can be inverted to any degree required (see Fig. 6i, B). The pad above the base of the malleolus must be large enough to allow the foot to be inverted to the fullest extent without its inner border Fig. 6i.â€”DuruvrREN's Splint. In A is shown the manner in which the upper end of the sphnt is fastened to the leg so that it cannot slip. A folded handkerchief is used, and is applied aronnd the limb on a level with the tubercle of the tibia. In J3 the splint is seen applied, and the method of inverting the foot is shown. The splint is generally further secured to the leg by a band.ige. touching the splint, as otherwise pain and a pressure sore might result. The bandage thus applied around the heel does not press on the fracture in the fibula at all, and if there be any backward displacement of the foot, this can be overcome by passing the ends of the bandage around the anterior prong only; the foot is thus both inverted and dragged forward. After the leg has been fi.xed in this way, the limb should be slung in a cradle with support to the heel. In three or four days it is easy to carry out passive movement and massage of the ankle, without removing the apparatus, by merely undoing the handkerchief which inverts the foot;

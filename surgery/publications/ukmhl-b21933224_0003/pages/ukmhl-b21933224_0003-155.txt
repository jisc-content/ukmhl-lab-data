FRACTURES OF THE PATELLA. 135 them, and this is an essential reason why union by bone does not occur except after operation. The third point to remember is that the lower fragment is usually tilted forwards, and therefore when the upper fragment is brought down into contact, the cartilaginous surfaces do not lie in the same plane. Not uncommonly also the upper fragment is somewhat tilted so that the broken surface looks backwards; this, however, is not nearly so marked as in the lower fragment. Treatment in recent cases.—It follows from the above that the object of the treatment must be threefold; the separation must be over- come, the layer of fibrous tissue and periosteum between the fractured sur- faces must be removed, and the tilting of the fragments must be remedied. Fig. 52.—Transverse Fracture of the Patella. '1 he specimen shows the curhng-in of the fibrous aponeurosis over the front of the bone, so that the fractured surfaces are partly hidden. (A/tcr He//erich.) Operative.—It is evident that by no means short of operation can these objects be effectually carried out. We therefore recommend an open operation as the best treatment for recent fractures of the patella. Time for operation.—It is sometimes asked at what period the opera- tion should be done. Some surgeons prefer to wait for four or five days for the inflammation and synovitis set up by the injury to subside, and at first we were also of that opinion. Lately, however, we have been in the habit of operating as soon as possible after the accident, and we have seen no reason whatever to regret doing so. There is this advantage in an immediate operation, that the sooner it is carried out'the sooner can movement be begun and the less chance is there of adhesions forming.

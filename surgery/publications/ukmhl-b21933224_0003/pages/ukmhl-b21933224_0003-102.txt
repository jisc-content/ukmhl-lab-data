CHAPTER IV. FRACTURES OF THE FORE-ARM AND HAND. FRACTURES OF THE BONES OF THE FORE-ARM. FRACTURE OF THE OLECRANON. CAUSES.—This accident is generally caused by direct violence from falls upon the tip of the elbow, the olecranon coming into violent contact with the ground. Sometimes however it may occur from muscular action alone, the olecranon being snapped off by the sudden contraction of the triceps when the arm is bent at right angles. The fracture usually occurs near the base of the olecranon, but in some cases the tip alone may be broken off, while in others the fracture runs obliquely from below upwards and forwards into the joint near the front of the greater sigmoid cavity. DISPLACEMENT.—The process is generally completely separated, but sometimes the fibrous expansion of the triceps and anconeus muscles over the back of the bone may remain intact, when only very slight separation of the fragments occurs. When the tip of the olecranon is broken off and the fascia is torn, the small piece of bone is often drawn up the arm for some considerable distance. In fractures in the usual situation, near the base of the process, the amount of separation depends upon how far the fibrous tissues are intact; in those still lower down, in which a part of the curved articular surface of the ulna remains in connection with the olecranon, the separation is not very marked, particularly when the arm is straight, as the curved articular surface prevents displacement upwards. In any case, however, the separation of the fragments is increased when the elbow is bent. Fracture of the olecranon entails more or less inability to extend the fore- arm. When bony union does not take place, the patient is unable to throw, to forcibly extend the arm, to carry heavy weights and so forth. In fact the limb, even when the separation is not great, is much feebler than its fellow; its range of movement is also not infrequently much

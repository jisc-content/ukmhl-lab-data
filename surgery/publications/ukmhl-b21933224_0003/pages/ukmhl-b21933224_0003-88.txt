THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. 68 however the fracture is oblique, displacement is likely to recur, and the limb requires very careful immobilisation. Retentive apparatus.—Various measures may be employed to retain the fragments in position after the fracture has been properly reduced. If the fracture be transverse, a very simple arrangement will suffice. A pad should be placed in the axilla (which is dusted with boracic powder) and kept in position by means of a handkerchief or broad bandage applied Fig. 25.—Methoij of securing a Pad in the Axilla. A piece of bandage is fastened to each end of the axillary pad and these are made to forma figure-of-eight as shown above. as in Fig. 25; this will prevent displacement inwards of the lower fragment. The elbow is then flexed, and the arm brought to the side, with its long axis parallel to that of the body. A large triangular bandage is taken and its base is fastened horizontally around the arm and trunk just above the elbow, while its apex hangs downwards. The latter is then turned up around the fore-arm and the point of the elbow, between the limb and the chest, turned over and pinned to the base of the handkerchief which surrounds the trunk (see Fig. 26). The wrist is supported by a narrow sling. In this form of fracture there is no need for any special extension apparatus. For greater safety however it is also well to put on a shoulder- cap, which may be made as follows. A large sheet of brown paper of suitable size is taken and applied to the sound .shoulder, and from it is cut a pattern for the .shoulder-cap (see Fig. 27, A). This should extend from the root of the neck above to within an inch or two of the elbow joint below, and

PHOSPHORUS NECROSIS. may elapse before the affected portion is loose; and, as a large portion of the jaw will almost certainly be destroyed, it seems more feasible to proceed to the removal of the affected portion of the bone directly necrosis is established. If the periosteum be carefully separated along with the superficial layer of living bone, sufficiently firm bone will usually be thrown out to make a useful mandible. The operation of excision of the mandible will be described later when we discuss the affections of that bone.

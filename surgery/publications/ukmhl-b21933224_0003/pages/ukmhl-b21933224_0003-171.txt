FRACTURES OF THE TIBIA ALONE. the upper, means must be taken to relax the calf muscles—especially if the fracture be at all oblique—as their contraction is apt to produce a tilting forward of the upper fragment, the result being that union occurs with the fragments in bad position and the sharp lower end of the upper frag- ment may perforate the skin. There is not so much danger of this accident happening as there is when both bones of the leg are broken ; in the cases under consideration the unbroken fibula acts as a splint and prevents excessive deformity. Treatment.—The best splint at first is Maclntyre's, arranged so that the heel is well supported (see p. 153); a pad is placed over the tibia, two or three inches above the fracture, and firmly bound down so as to keep the upper fragment in position. This pad must not be applied too near to the fracture, as otherwise the skin will very readily slough from the pressure. If there be any difficulty in bringing or retaining the fragments in proper position, the best plan is to cut down on the fracture and to screw the fragments together (see p. 51); the wound heals by first intention, and in the course of a week the leg may be put up in a Croft's splint, when perfect union should be obtained. If the effusion be so great as to threaten the vitality of the skin, the limb may be fixed either in well-padded lateral poroplastic splints, not 60.—" Fkacture Uox " or " Hox Splint " for Fractures ok the Leo. The two lateral splints nre rolled up in .i folded sheet as described in the text, fastened to ihe limb by straps and buckles, and the whole apparatus slung to the cradle. A bandage is usually also put on over all. bandaged on too firmly, or, still better, in what is termed a "box splint." This />ox splint, or " fracture box," is also a very convenient form of apparatus for fractures of both bones, and indeed for any fracture of the leg where a temporary arrangement is required before the limb is put up

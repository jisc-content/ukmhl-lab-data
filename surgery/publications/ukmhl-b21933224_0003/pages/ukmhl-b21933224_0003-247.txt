GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 227 circular sweeps of the knife; after each cut they are firmly retracted until the bone is exposed opposite the proposed point of division (see Fig. 66). It is well to carry the last sweep of the knife right down through the periosteum, which is thus divided circularly on the same level as the muscles ; as the latter are retracted, the periosteum should be stripped up by a rugine (see Fig. 67) along with the muscular mass. The result of this is that, when the bone has been sawn and the parts relaxed, a tube of periosteum falls over the cut end of the bone and thus produces a nicely rounded end for it. The muscles should never be first stripped off the periosteum, and the latter then separated from the bone.

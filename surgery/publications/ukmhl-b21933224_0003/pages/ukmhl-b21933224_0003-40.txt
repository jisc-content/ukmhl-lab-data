THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. 20 nated with plaster, applied over the front of the limb (of course outside the bandage securing the posterior portion), and fastened in position by a second bandage. The whole apparatus is then allowed to dry thoroughly. This is a simpler plan than that often adopted of holding both anterior and posterior portions in position at the same time, and bandaging them on together (see Fig. 8); but the latter method is the one that would be adopted Fig. 8.—Croft's Splint. Application of the anterior and posterior portions. The illustration shows the interval down the side of the limb between the two portions. for choice in recent cases of fracture, for instance in children, where the simultaneous bandaging of the two portions of the splint would involve less disturbance of the limb. The splint may be left undisturbed as long as may be found desirable; when it is removed, the muslin bandage is cut up on either side of the anterior portion of the splint, which thus is made to form a Fig. g.—Croft's Splint. T/te antero-posierior splint removed. The figure shows the trough-like splint thus formed. sort of lid to the trough formed by the posterior portion. (See Fig. 9.) All the superfluous bandage is then removed and the splint re-fastened in position by an ordinary bandage. In a muscular or restless patient it may be necessary to further strengthen either form of Croft's splint. This may be done by incor-

FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. 71 be made to provide for suitable extension. This is generally done by in- serting a pad in the axilla, fixing on a shoulder-cap as before, and supporting the wrist and hand by a narrow wrist-sling. The elbow is left free, in order that the weight of the limb may to some extent act as an extending force. This method of producing extension is not however entirely satisfactory ; the bands which fasten on the shoulder-cap prevent the weight of the limb from really acting to any considerable extent upon the fracture, and if there be much over-riding of the fragments, some more efficient extension must be employed. The importance of this will be readily understood if â€¢ the great disability which follows fractures that are not kept in good position be borne in mind. For the first few days there- fore, if the patient will assent to it, he should be kept in bed, and a pulley extension apparatus applied to the upper arm, taking purchase just above the elbow. The arm should be kept somewhat away from the side, and the cord to which the weight is attached should pass over a pulley at Fig. 28.â€”Weight Extension in I'"racture of the Ui'i>ei< End of the Humerus. Extension applied while the patient is in hed. This shows a simple method of .ipplyine extension. The pulley-.irm is attached to the side of the bed and e.xtension is made with the arm somewhat abducted. The counter-extension is made from the end of the bed in a line parallel with that of the extension ; a large sling or a jack-towel is used for this purpose, and fixes the scapula and thorax. the side of the bed ; a weight of three or four pounds will generally be sufficient. Counter-extension is made by passing a well-padded sling round the axilla, and fastening the ends to the head of the bed (see Fig. 28). At the end of the first week the patient may be allowed to get up, wearing a shoulder-cap ; during the day, extension is made from the elbow

Green-stick fracture.—GreoA-stick fractures should be treated in the same manner as the complete varieties, and special care must be taken to reduce the deformity properly. This is best done by seizing and carrying back the shoulder firmly with one hand and pressing on the pro- jection with the other until the deformity has entirely disappeared. Compound fracture.—If the fracture of the clavicle be compound the case must be treated by the methods ordinarily employed for com- pound fracture (see p. 31).

The hand need not necessarily be included as shown in the figure. the bone are thoroughly purified, and, in addition to this, the fractured ends should be drilled and secured together by silver wire. The wound is then stitched up, a drainage tube introduced, for fear that complete asepsis has not been secured, and suitable dressings applied. The patient should be laid upon his back with a narrow pillow along the spine, and the bandages should be so arranged as to pull the shoulders well back, while at the same time the elbow is supported; good union usually takes place. It must however be borne in mind that union in compound fractures is not so rapid as in those that are simple, and the apparatus should be kept on for at least six weeks.

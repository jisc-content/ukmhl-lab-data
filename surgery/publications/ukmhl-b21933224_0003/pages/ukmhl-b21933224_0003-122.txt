I02 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. in promoting the free mobility of the fingers, and may with advantage be practised from the first. FRACTURES OF THE PHALANGES. CAUSES.—Fracture of the phalanges by direct violence is not at all uncommon. The first phalanx is most commonly fractured owing to its greater length and mobility. The displacement varies according to the cause of the fracture, but in most cases it is comparatively slight. TREATMENT.—After the fracture has been reduced, all that is necessary is to apply a well-moulded block-tin or guttapercha splint. The block-tin splint is the more useful and should be put on the anterior surface and cut so that it covers the greater part of the palm ; this palmar portion fixes the metacarpo-phalangeal joint (see Fig. 37). The splint is carefully padded and bandaged on; it should be kept on for three or KoR fractures*of''the four weeks. After the first week the fracture should receives the finger while the be taken down daily, and, whilst the fragments are flattened rounded portion n j • • ^ ^ ui. 11 j j^i. 4.- ^ goes into the palm of the fixcd, the jomts should be wcU movcd and the patient encouraged to flex them; this is necessary to avoid adhesion of the tendons as a result of teno-synovitis set up in the im- mediate vicinity of the fracture, and also to avoid adhesions of the tendons to the broken bone. Union usually takes place with extreme readiness. If the fracture be compound the treatment must of course be that for compound fracture in general.

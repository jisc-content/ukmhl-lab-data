255 AMPUTATION AT THE WRIST JOINT. the circumstances in which this operation is called for. The fore-arm should be held horizontally at right angles to the trunk in a position of full supination: both flaps should be cut from without inwards, and the palmar flap should be dissected up first. It facilitates the operation to detach the pisiform bone and raise it with the palmar flap; it can easily be dissected out afterwards. An incision is made commencing at the tip of one styloid process and carried obliquely downwards along that border of the hand for about an inch. It is then carried across the back of the hand to a point an inch below the opposite styloid process and thence runs obliquely upwards to the tip of that structure. A similar incision is then carried across the front of the wrist; this should extend slightly further down the palm than the one on the dorsum (see Fig. 81, A). The flaps are dissected up, the hand is disarticulated, and, when the edges of the wound are sutured together, the incision lies over the lower end of the bones. By a long palmar flap.—When the tissues in the palm are intact, a longer palmar flap can be made, and then little or no dorsal flap will be required. In cutting this long palmar flap however it must be remembered that it should be broad and not pointed; the incision should commence on the outer aspect of the styloid process of the radius and should run downwards along the outer side of the thumb to a little above the tran.s- verse crease of the wrist; it should then be carried transversely across the palm to a corresponding point on the opposite side, and then along the ulnar border of the hand to the tip of the styloid process of the ulna (see Fig. 81, B). The structures are divided down to the bone, A B Fig. 81.—Amputations through the Wrist Joint. A. The modified circular method. B. Amputation by a long palmar flap.

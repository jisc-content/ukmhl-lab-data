FRACTURES OF THE SCAPULA. 65 and moderate in range, and it should be repeated daily for the first week, after which time it may be employed more frequently and more freely. In the intervals the arm should be kept in the sling or apparatus above described, which should not be wholly discarded for about five weeks. Fracture of the coracoid process, if accompanied by comparatively slight displacement, is best treated by carrying the elbow as far forwards and upwards as possible, so as to relax the pull of the muscles upon it. The position of the arm is practically that employed in cases of fracture of the clavicle. The arm should be firmly bound to the side and the elbow supported. If, however, there be very considerable -displacement, and no contra-indication to operation exists, the best plan will be to cut down over the anterior edge of the deltoid, expose the coracoid process and wire it to the scapula. This fracture, however, is extremely rare, and is often complicated with other severe injuries, so that this operation would seldom be called for. PT. III. J;

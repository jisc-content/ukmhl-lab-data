FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. 69 at the front and back above should extend well over {tie pectoral and scapular regions. Lower down it should encircle from half to two-thirds of the circumference of the arm (see Fig. 27, B). When the pattern has been cut, it is laid upon a sheet of guttapercha, poroplastic or leather of suitable size, which is cut to it. The splint is then softened; if guttapercha, it is immersed in hot water, or if poroplastic, it -is warmed before a hot fire or steamed in a steriliser; if leather it is immersed in vinegar. Poroplastic is on the whole perhaps the most manageable and most comfortable material. Whilst the splint is still soft it is applied to the injured side and rapidly fitted, moulded and bandaged in position. If guttapercha or poroplastic be used, care must be taken not to apply it direct to the skin for fear of causing burning. It is well to first envelop the part in a layer of cotton wool or, if that be not at hand, an ordinary folded bath-towel. flG. 26. â€”BanUAGESS APl'LIEl) IN TkANSVEUSK FkACTUKE Ol' THE Ul'I'ER EnI) OK THE HuMERU.s. ] he left-hand figure shows how the tri.ingular bandage is applied hori- >. zont.nlly aroiind the thor.-ix after the fr:icturo has been reduced and a pad pl.iced in the .-ixilla. I he other figure shows the apparatus completed. The point of the tri.-itigular bandage is turned up around the fore-arm, between it and the chest, and turned over and pinned, as shown above. A narrow wrist-sling is then put on, with a shonldei -cap over all. When the splint is properly moulded and before it becomes quite hard, it should be removed from the limb, and a number of holes punched in it to allow for the escape of perspiration; these need only be punched in

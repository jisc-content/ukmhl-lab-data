AMPUTATIONS. 250 order to render the scar less noticeable the vertical incision, or handle of the racket, may be made upon the ulnar or radial sides of the metacarpal bones respectively (see Fig. 78, A). When it is desirable to remove the head of the metacarpal bone as well as the finger, the line of section through the bone should be obliquely downwards and to the opposite side. It is then also well to slope off the angle of junction between the oval of the racket and the handle, and thus to convert the incision into a long oblique one, in preference to the typical racket-shaped incision (see Fig. 78, B). This gives a more sightly scar. Fir,. 78.—Amputations of the Index and Little Fingers. A. Incisions for amputation at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints. B. Incisions for similar amputations but accompanied by removal of the head of the metacarpal bone. The dotted line shows the line of section through the latter. AMPUTATION OF A METACARPAL BONE.—It may some- times be necessary to remove the metacarpal bone as well as the finger. This should be done if possible without opening the carpo-metacarpal articulation. Generally it will be sufficient to divide the bone just below its base, and this can be readily done by simply extending the vertical portion incision upwards. The sides of the bone can then be cleared and the shaft divided at the desired spot, when the anterior surface of the bone can easily be cleared by pulling it forcibly backwards. As a rule however it is but seldom necessary to remove the metacarpal bone as well as the finger. When amputation of the metacarpal is called for it is done for some disease of the bone itself, such as tumour, tuberculous

DIVISION I. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES SECTION FRACTURES. CHAPTER 1. FRACTURES : GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. DEFINITION. — By a fracture is understood a sudden solution of continuity in a bone brought about by some form of violence. Before dealing with fractures of the individual bones, it will be well to refer to some points in the treatment of fractures in general. CAUSES.—It is usual to divide the causes of fracture into the exciting causes—that is to say, the actual violence producing the fracture,—and the various predisposing causes which lead to brittleness of the bones and a tendency to fracture upon the application of even a slight degree of force. It is important to bear these predisposing causes in mind, because, when such exist, the treatment must be directed, not only to replacing the fragments and keeping them in position, but also to combating the pre- disposing cause. Exciting- causes.—When violence is applied to a bone, it may give way at a point directly opposite the seat of injury—when the fracture is termed one by direct violence—or it may break at some distance from the point of application of the force—when the fracture is spoken of as one from indirect violence. The question as to whether any particular fracture is caused by direct or indirect violence is of importance Uoth in prognosis and treatment. When the fracture Ts due to indirect violence, the line of fracture is very often oblique or spiral, and there is frequently some difficulty in reducing and keeping the fragments in proper position. When the fracture is caused by direct violence, on the other hand, it is PT. III. A

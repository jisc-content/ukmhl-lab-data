FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE. 6l adjacent edges of the bandage together and to rub a little starch solution into it, so as to make it firm and prevent it from slipping. This apparatus should be kept oa for about three weeks; should it become loose in the interval it must of course be renewed. At the end of three weeks it may be left off and the arm carried in a large elbow- sling for another week or ten days. Union takes place very rapidly, and an ununited fracture of the clavicle is of very rare occurrence. Other forms of apparatus have been devised for this fracture, but the methods above described are on the whole the best. Of fracture of the acromial end.—When the fracture occurs in the neighbourhood of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments, either the hand- kerchief arrangement or Sayre's apparatus should be applied, even though no deformity exists when the patient is first seen; this is necessary to prevent the tip of the shoulder rotating forward at a later period.

The arrows show the direction in which the hands exert pressure. Of fracture at the sternal end.—When the fracture is at the sternal end, the treatment largely depends upon whether there is any deformity and whether there is any other fracture present. Usually there are other injuries, so that the patient is confined to bed; it then suffices to keep

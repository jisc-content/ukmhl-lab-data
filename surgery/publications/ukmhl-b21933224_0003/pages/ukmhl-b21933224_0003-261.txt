GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 241 direction of the longer flap, so as to stretch this as mucii as possible ; for example, if the anterior flap be the longer, the bandage should be carried from the anterior surface of the limb over the end of the bone and up on to the posterior surface; should the long flap be the posterior one, the bandage should be commenced on the posterior surface. As we have already said it is necessary, when the amputation is through the thigh, to carry the upper part of the bandage around the pelvis in form of a spica, so as to prevent its slipping off the limb entirely. When the case is one in which there is a long heavy posterior flap, as occurs for example in Syme's amputation, the chief object of a stump Fig. 75.â€”The Stump Bandage. In A is shown the method of commencing to cover j^. in the end of the stump. The direction of the bandage is ch.inged from circular to antero-posterior hy placing the thumb upon it ,ns shown above. The bandage is then carried over the end of the stump and up along its posterior surface, where it is caught beneath the forefinger and then brought back again, slightly to one side of the middle line, beneath the thumb once more. In B the bandage is shown completed and carried up as a spica around the pelvis. bandage is to support the flap and push it well forwards: this form of bandage must therefore be employed for some weeks after the ampu- tation wound has healed, as otherwise the scar is apt to be pulled downwards over the end of the bone. In this case of course the bandage is commenced on the posterior aspect of the limb, carried downwards over PT. in. Q

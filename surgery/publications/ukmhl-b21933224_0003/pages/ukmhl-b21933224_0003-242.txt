DIVISION II-AMPUTATIONS. CHAPTER XV. AMPtTTATIONS : GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. PRESENT POSITION OF AMPUTATION IN SURGERY. In reviewing the position that amputation occupies in surgery at the present time, one cannot fail to be struck by the great changes that have taken place in recent years ; changes so profbund that it is no exaggeration to say that our views on amputation have been quite revolutionized. Among the most important alterations we may briefly notice the following : Greater deliberation of present-day operating.—The first great point of importance is the entire disappearance of those brilliant operations in which the limb was removed (usually by transfixion or by the circular method) in a few seconds. Their place has been taken by more careful, deliberate and elaborately planned operations, in which the chief consideration is not the length of time taken in removing the limb, but the proper formation of a sound stump provided with a sufficient covering of soft parts, and as long as the condition of the tissues will allow. This change has been chiefly brought about by the introduction of anaesthetics, by means of which the surgeon is able to take time over the operation, and to plan and carry out its steps with due deliberation. Infrequency of amputations.—A second and equally striking point is the comparative infrequency with which amputation is now performed. It was formerly the custom to submit to amputation many cases in which the question does not now even occur to the surgeon, for, thanks to the intro- duction of asepsis, conservative surgery is carried to a degree formerly undreamt of. In compound fracture, for example, amputation was formerly the rule, but now it is possible to save a large proportion of the cases, either by employing conservative methods, or, at the worst, by means of partial amputations which were out of the question at a time when the risk of sepsis was constantly present to the surgeon's mind.

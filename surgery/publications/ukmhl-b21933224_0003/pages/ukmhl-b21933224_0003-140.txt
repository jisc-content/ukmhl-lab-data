THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. 120 In fractures near the centre of the shaft.—-When the fracture is lower down in the shaft there is still some tendency to pulling forward of the uppei fragment, although it is not nearly so marked as in the form just described. The lower fragment is drawn upwards and backwards, its upper end being behind and rather to the outer side of the lower ; this gives a well marked bowing forwards and outwards of the thigh. There is generally considerable shortening. Treatment.—Of fracture just below the trochanters.—In this fracture it is somewhat difficult to obtain a good result because the displacement of the short upper fragment cannot be overcome by traction; the lower fragment must therefore be brought into a line with the upper. To do this, the thigh is flexed until the axis of the lower fragment coincides with that of the upper; on account of the abducted position and the external rotation of the latter, the lower fragment should be also abducted and rotated slightly outwards. This position may be maintained by placing the limb upon a Macintyre's splint directed some- what away from the middle line, bent at the knee, and raised sufficiently to bring the fragments into proper line. The leg is made to lie with the foot somewhat everted on the splint. Strapping is then applied to the thigh from immediately below the fracture to just above the knee, and from this a cord is carried over a pulley attached to the bed at a suitable height, and a weight of five or six pounds is fastened to it (see Fig. 44).

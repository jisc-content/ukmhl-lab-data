FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE. 59 varied at will. On the whole we decidedly recommend this method for use in adults in preference to all others. The sling supporting the elbow should pass over the sound shoulder only, and should not press anywhere on the region of the fracture. Fio. 21.—Apparatus for pulling hack the Shoulders in Fractured Clavicle. This is merely a more convenient method of applying the loops around the shoulders described in the text and illustrated in the preceding figure. The loops are made by encasing wool in several folds of muslin, and the requisite amount of retraction of the shoulders is easily regulated by the strap and buckle connecting them. This apparatus is more easily altered and gives rise to less chance of pressure than the ordinary knotted handkerchiefs. Sayre's method.—The method most commonly employed in fracture of the clavicle is that known as Sayre's. When the patient is an adult, the arm and chest should first be carefully shaved, and the hair in the axilla cut short and powdered with boracic powder. A strip of adhesive plaster, three inches broad for an adult, and two inches for children, is looped around the arm about its centre, with the non-adhesive side next the skin, and the ends of the loop pinned to prevent it slipping. If the strapping be merely wound round the arm constriction will occur when it is pulled on and will cause trouble; the loop must be wide enough to allow three fingers to be inserted between the strapping and the skin of the back of the arm. A pad of salicylic wool is then placed in the axilla and the arm is pulled back as far as possible by traction on the strip of plaster (see Fig. 22). In Sayre's original method no pad was inserted in the axilla, but this is a defect, as it leaves the inward displacement uncorrected. W'lien the arm

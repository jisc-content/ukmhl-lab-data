137 FRACTURES OF THE PATELLA. Drilling the bone.—When the surfaces have thus been prepared, the upper fragment is bored for the passage of the wire. The best instrument for drilling the patella, and indeed most bones, is a square bradawl or " reamer " (see Fig. 16), such as is used in the manufacture of bird-cages; this is much less likely to split the bone. At the point where the bradawl is to be introduced, a small vertical incision should be made through the fibrous structures down to the bone, and each side of this incision should be seized by a pair of catch forceps, so that the edges of the aperture can be held aside, and thus the end of the wire does not get entangled and Fig 54.—Wiring the Patella. Drilling the lower fra^tncnt. The catch-forceps are seen retracting the edges of the slit in the soft parts pver the bone. The wire has been passed through the upper fragment. For the sake of clearness the fingers which push up and steady the lower fragment while it is being drilled are not shown. the opening of the drill hole is not lost (see Fig. 54). The instrument should be entered at the centre of the anterior aspect of the bone, as far away from the fractured surface as possible, and driven obliquely through it, so that the point emerges just in front of the articular cartilage. Passing the wire.-—After the upper fragment has been bored in this manner, a piece of strong silver wire, about a tenth of an inch in thick- ness (known as No. 5 French gauge in the trade), and quite soft and flexible, is passed through the hole. The point on the fractured surface of the lower fragment corresponding to the point of emergence of the wire through the upper one is then carefully ascertained, and a drill is driven downwards and forwards through it until it emerges from the front

On the whole, however, the simplest plan of controlling the circulation when the amputation is to be performed high up through the humerus by the modified circular method, is to deepen the incision and expose the brachial artery after the anterior flap has been cut, and then to divide it between two ligatures before proceeding further with the operation. Care must be taken not to damage the artery above the point of ligature in the subsequent steps of the operation. Fig. 84.—Methop of controlling H/kmorrha(;f, in Amputations of the Uphf.r Arm. The rubber tubing is applied in a figure-of-eight around the shoulder, over a pad in the axilla (drawn too large in the figure), and is kept from slipping off when the bone is sawn by the slips of bandage passed beneath it front and back, and held as depicted above. AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. A large variety of methods of amputating through the shoulder joint have been described from time to time, the most popular until recently being that by means of the deltoid flap. Here again, however, irregular operations of all kinds will be the most useful in actual practice, as the operation is usually called for in cases where it may be extremely difficult to obtain flaps by the orthodox methods. When a set operation is possible, probably the best'and most satisfactory in its results is Spence's operation (see Fig. 85, A). Spence describes his operation as follows : Spence's operation.—"Supposing the right arm to be the subject of^amputation. The arm being slightly abducted and the head of the

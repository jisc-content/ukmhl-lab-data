6o THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. has been pulled back as far as possible, the free end of the strapping looped around the arm is carried horizontally across the back of the chest and brought roundj beneath the opposite axilla across the front, so as to completely encircle the thorax, and is finally pinned to itself just beyond Fig. 22.â€”Sayre's Apparatus FOR Fractured Clavicle. Applying tlie arm loop. 'I'he arm is pulled forcibly backwards by traction upon the strapping, which is afterwards fastened as shown in the following figure. the loop around the arm. The strapping thus applied acts as a fulcrum, so that, when the elbow is pushed forwards, the shoulder with the outer fragment of the clavicle is carried backwards. This is done by an assistant, who also flexes the elbow, carrying it forwards and upwards until the fingers nearly reach the opposite shoulder, while the forearm lies across the front of the chest (see Fig. 23). A second strip of strapping is next carried over the sound shoulder obliquely downwards across the back to the point of the elbow, where it is split for an inch or so for the reception of the olecranon; thence it is carried up to its starting-point over the sound shoulder, and the two ends are pinned or sewn together (see Fig. 24). This completes the apparatus, but it is advisable in addition to apply a bandage over all and, if the apparatus is to be left undisturbed for some time, it is well to sew the

85 FRACTURES OF THE OLECRANON. cartilaginous surface of the joint. After having ascertained the spot on the upper fragment exactly corresponding to this puncture by pushing the frac- tured ends accurately together, the bradawl is withdrawn, a vertical median incision is made dividing the periosteum over the upper fragment about half an inch above the line of fracture, and its edges are seized with forceps as before. The bradawl is then introduced obliquely through the bone here and made to appear on the fractured surface exactly opposite the hole previously made through the base of the process. A silver wire about a twentieth of an inch in diameter (No. 13 English or No. 5 French gauge) is then pushed through the hole on the posterior surface of the fractured process, and a good length of it is pulled out between the fractured surfaces ; Fig. 33.â€”Opekation for Wiring the Olecranon. Method of passin<; the luires. The elbow is fully flexed to increase the space between the fragments. After the wire has been passed through the hole in the detached process, a long loop^ as shown in the figure, is pulled out, and the end of the loop is pushed through the hole in the base of the olecranon from the fractured surface. The catch forceps are in position, as in the pre- ceding figure; those on the detached process have been taken off after the passage of the wire. The hand is put in in dotted outline in order to render the detail more clear. this is bent into a loop so as to allow the end to be pushed through the corresponding hole on the opposite fractured surface, and thus to be made to emerge from the aperture at the base of the process (see Fig. 33). During the passage of the wire it is necessary that tlie edges of the slits in the periosteum and fascia made before introducing the bradawl should be held

CHAPTER VI. FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. Fr.\ctures of this bone may be divided into those affecting the upper end, the lower end, and the shaft. FRACTURES OF THE UPPER END OF THE FEMUR. Varieties.—These are divided into those of the neck and those of the great trochanter. Fractures of the neck of the femur are again usually subdivided into the intra-capsular and the extra-capsular forms. In the intra-capsular fractures the line of fracture lies within the capsule of the joint, whilst in the extra-capsular forms it lies outside it. As a rule, however, the distinction between the two forms is not perfectly accurate, because the line of fracture is generally partly intra- and partly extra- capsular in its course; the fracture is therefore called intra- or extra- capsular according as the greater part of the line of fracture is within or without the capsule. INTRA-CAPSULAR FRACTURE.—True intracapsular fracture is comparatively rare, and most commonly occurs in old people in whom senile bone changes are very marked ; the line of fracture is usually close to the head of the bone. In old subjects a process occurs termed osteo- porosis in which the bone becomes more porous, fatty, and brittle than normal, and, in addition, changes also occur in the direction of the neck of the bone, which becomes more horizontal; for both these reasons fracture readily occurs. The fracture is generally caused by a comparatively slight injury, such as a fall upon the knee or upon the trochanter. When it results from indirect violence, such as a fall upon the knee, there is no tendency to impaction; but when it follows falls or blows upon the trochanter, a certain amount of impaction is not uncommon, the neck of the bone being driven into the head. The impaction is, however, not usually permanent, and is insufficient to insure proper bony union.

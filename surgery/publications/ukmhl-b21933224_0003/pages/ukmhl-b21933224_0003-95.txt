75 FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. situation. Probably the chief cause of this is neglect to properly fix the elbow joint after reducing the fracture. It is well to employ an anaesthetic, both to overcome the muscular contraction and to enable the surgeon to apply the splints properly. The bone at the seat of fracture should be surrounded by four splints—an internal straight one reaching from the axilla to just above the internal condyle; anterior and posterior ones, also straight, extending the whole length of the arm; and a shoulder- cap which is prolonged below into an external angular splint reaching as far down as the lower third of the fore-arm. The short splints should together be about two-thirds of the diameter of the limb in width, should Fii;. 30.—Apparatus fob Fhacturks of the Shaft of the Humerus. In the right- h.ind figure is seen the first stage; .interior, posterior, and internal straight splints are applied. In the left-hand figure a shoulder-cap, prolonged downwards into an e.xternal angular splint, has been put on over these. The forearm is shown with its long axis parallel to the antero-posterior plane of the body. The apparatus is completed by a wrist-sling. be well padded, and should be fixed around the arm with two or three straps and buckles. The elbow is flexed to right angle, and the fore-arm is put up in a position midway between pronation and supination. The hand should be supported in a sling, and the arm fastened to the side by a handkerchief or broad bandage (see Fig. 30). It is necessary that the arm should hang vertically at the side with the long axis of the fore- arm 'parallel to the antero-posterior diameter of the trunk; if the fore-arm be brought at all forwards across the chest, rotation of the lower fragment upon'jts vertical axis is apt to take place.

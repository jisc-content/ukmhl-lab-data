FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 133 passive movements and massage will be required from this time onwards to maintain the full range of mobility in the joint. DETACHMENT OF ARTICULAR CARTILAGE. This accident sometimes results from falls upon the knee or the foot. A portion of the articular cartilage with its underlying bone is detached from the surface of one of the condyles of the femur and thus becomes a loose body in the knee joint. Treatment.â€”If the exact nature of the injury be made out at the time, as by feeling a loose body moving about in the joint, the best plan is to do an arthrotomy at once and remove it. If the surgeon delays operation, the loose body sets up considerable changes in the synovial membrane which may end in the formation of firm adhesions and some- times in a villous condition of the synovial membrane as a whole, not unlike that seen in osteo-arthritis. The loose fragment rarely becomes united to the bone; if it does, it is in wrong position, and for this reason also the sooner it is removed the better. The exact details of the opera- tion will be described fully when we deal with the treatment of loose bodies in the knee joint (see Part IV.).

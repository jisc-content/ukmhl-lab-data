In the case both of the great and the little toes it is of the utmost importance to remove as little as possible of the metatarsal bone because both of them play an important part in supporting the weight of the body. It is also important to remember that no incisions should be carried into the sole of the foot, nor should they be placed either upon its inner or outer borders, as otherwise the resulting scar will be subject to pressure and may be a source of considerable pain. It is also of the highest importance to remember that the skin of the toes and the feet, especially in the region of the nails, is extremely difficult to disinfect thoroughly, and special care will have to be taken in a 4 £ Fig. SS.—Amputations of the Toes.

AMPUTATIONS OF THE FOOT. A great variety of amputations are described for use in the foot, but in actual practice it is extremely rarely that the majority of these can be

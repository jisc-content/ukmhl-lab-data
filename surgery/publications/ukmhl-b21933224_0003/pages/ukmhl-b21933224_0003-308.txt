At the same time, when it is feasible, the scar should be made to lie out of the way of the end of the bone; should this not be possible it is of course necessary to pull out the nerves and cut them short so that their ends cannot become involved in the cicatrix. For some time the operation was done by transfixion, and some surgeons still prefer to cut the anterior flap from without inwards .and the posterior one by transfixion. There is no great objection to this, but the flaps in all cases are more accurately fashioned if they are cut from without inwards.

Both the Esmarch's tubing and the strips of bandage with which they are pulled upwards should be carefully disinfected before use. » controlled by means of a stout indiarubber cord—which should be previously sterilised by boiling—passed around the limb at its upper limit. To prevent this from slipping off over the flaps after the femur has been divided, the best plan is to take two strips of sterilised bandage of suflScient length and lay them vertically over the limb, one on either side, and then to apply the elastic tube over these. When the tubing is in position, the pieces of bandage are converted into loops by seizing the two ends,

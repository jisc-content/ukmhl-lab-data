Further, the pahnar flap is thick and contains the terminations of the sensory nerves, whilst the cicatrix lies upon the dorsal aspect of the finger and is out of the way of pressure. In performing the operation the surgeon stands in front of the patient, while an assistant standing on one side grasps the other fingers, flexes them and pulls them away from the affected member, so as to leave the finger to be operated on as free as possible. The surgeon takes the tip of the finger in his left hand, with the thumb upon the nail and the fore-finger beneath the pulp, and flexes the last joint to about a right angle. Then, with a straight, narrow bistoury about two inches in length, a transverse incision is made across the dorsal aspect of the head of the second KiG. 76.â€”Amputation of the Turminai.

The joint is then still further flexed and the phalanx pulled somewhat forwards, while the knife is gradually insinuated around the base of the terminal phalanx and then made to fashion a long palmar flap by keeping the blade parallel to, and in close contact with the anterior surface of the bone as the knife is carried

AMPUTATIONS THROUGH THE SHAFT OF THE FEMUR. 289 and these are pulled upon throughout the operation by an assistant, and thus the tubing is prevented from slipping (see Fig. 97). The assistant to whom this duty is entrusted may subsequently, when the tourniquet is removed, compress the femoral artery at the groin whilst the various bleeding vessels are being picked up in the flaps. When amputation is called for still higher up in the limb the circulation may be satisfactorily controlled by means of similar elastic tubing applied as a spica around the groin, the two ends crossing over the great trochanter and being then passed around the pelvis and fastened on the opposite side (see Fig. 98). In this case also it is well to Fig. 98.—Tourniquet for use in Amputations high up the Thigh. There is a sterilised pad over the line of the femoral which is compressed against the pelvic brim. pass Strips of bandage beneath the tubing, one near the inner fold of the groin and another over the trochanter, and to give them to an assistant, who pulls upon them and prevents the possibility of the tubing slipping. Prevention of shock.—In all these cases the surgeon must of course take every possible precaution to prevent shock (see Part I., p. 139), not the least valuable of which is rapidity of operation. The patient should be kept warm, the body being warmly clad and covered up. He should lie on a hot water-table and an enema of brandy and beef-tea should be administered half an hour before the operation, whilst the sixtieth of a grain of strychnine should be injected whilst he is being placed under the anjEsthetic, and repeated if necessary during the operation.

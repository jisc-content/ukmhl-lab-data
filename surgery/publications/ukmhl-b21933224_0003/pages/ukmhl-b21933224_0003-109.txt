89 FRACTURES OF THE OLECRANON. upper fibres will contract and a gap will be left in the muscle which may lead to much functional disability. The incision should therefore be V-shaped or zig-zag (see Fig. 35); two V's or serrations, with their apices upwards, carried through the breadth of the muscle are sufficient. It is done as follows : An incision commencing at the left edge of the triceps is carried obliquely upwards and to the right through the muscle for about two inches, according to the amount of shortening present; the termination of this incision should be distant from the left edge one quarter the entire Fio. 35.â€”Method of lengthening the Triceps in the operation for wiring i.ON<;-STANDiNG CASES OF FRACTURE OF THE OLECRANON. The larger figure shows the long flap required for the exposure of the Triceps, and the serrated division of the muscle described in the text. The smaller figure shows the method of approximating the serrations above and below, and how the muscle is elongated. The apices of the serrations are made blunt in order to secure a larger surface for union. breadth of the muscle. PVom this point a second incision is carried obliquely downwards and to the right, terminating in the centre of the muscle on a level with the starting-point of the first. A third incision then runs obliquely upwards, and also to the right, terminating at the three-quarter point, and the division is completed by carrying another from this point obliquely downwards to the right again, and bringing it out through the right edge of the muscle. This gives a series of serrations above and below the line of incision, and when the fragment with the tendon attached to it is pulled down, the apices of the serrations should

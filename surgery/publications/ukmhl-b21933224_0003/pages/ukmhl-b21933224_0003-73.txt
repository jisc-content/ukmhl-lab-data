FRACTURES : GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 53 fragment on one side, and then back through the corresponding holes on the other side (see Fig. i8, A). The loop of wire thus binds the frag- ments fairly firmly together. The ends are pulled tightly together, twisted, cut short and hammered down so as to lie flat on the bone. In transverse fractures the wires are not so necessary, but they are of Fig. i8.—Methods of Wiking a Long Bone. In A is shown the most efficacious plan for wiring the fragments in a case of oblique fracture. In B the fracture is trans- verse and the fragments are best kept in position by introducing wires as shown in the diagram. advantage, because, although they do not fix the bones firmly together, they tend to prevent the sliding of the fragments upon one another, and so obviate lateral displacement. Usually it is sufficient to pass a couple of single wires through opposite sides of the bone, bringing the ends out through the medulla above and vice versa below (see Fig. i8, B)^ the ends being twisted, cut short and hammered down as before. A B Fig. ig.—StxuRiNt; a Transverse Fracturr iiv An'iMiNfUM Plates. In A the cylindrical bone—the femur— is surrounded by a collar of aluminium. In the case of the tibia—shown in ^—its place is taken by two separate plates of the same metal. When there is great tendency to lateral displacement, a better fixation can be obtained by taking an oblong plate of aluminium which has holes bored in either end, applying it over the two fragments held properly in position, and then, with ordinary tintacks (previously nickeled), nailing the

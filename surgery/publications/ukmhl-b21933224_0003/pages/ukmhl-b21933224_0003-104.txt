As an additional safeguard against infection constant irrigation of the joint should be employed during the operation, the fluid used being 1-6000 or 1-8000 sublimate solution, at about the body Fig. 32.â€”Operation I'OR Wiring THE Olecranon. Drilling the bone. The catch- forceps are shown in position on either side of the vertical incision through the periosteum, the edges of which they hold apart as the drill is passed. The point of the drill is seen emerging just behind the articular cartilage. A vertical slit has been made in the soft parts over the fractured process, which has not yet been drilled. temperature. The advantage of this is that, while it prevents dust falling into the wound from the air, it at the same time wa.shes out all the blood-clots which are almost certain to have formed in the pouches of the synovial membrane, and so diminishes the chance of subsequent adhesions. Wiring is done as follows : a median vertical incision a quarter of an inch long is made through the periosteum of the ulna about half an inch below the line of fracture, and, before the knife is removed, the two edges of the incision are seized with catch-forceps and held apart, so as to expose the bone beneath (see Fig. 32). Then a hole is bored obliquely through the bone with a bradawV the point emerging on the fractured surface just behind the ^Almost any form of bradawl or drill may be used, but the one we prefer is the .square variety used in making bird cages. This is quite similar to the " reamer" shown in Fig. 16.

295 AMPUTATIONS THROUGH THE HIP JOINT. must be performed directly through the hip joint itself, and this is best done by means of an oval flap. A vertical incision is first made from the centre of Poupart's ligament downwards along the course of the femoral vessels, which are exposed, tied, and divided between two ligatures. The incision is then carried rapidly around the thigh in an oval form, and in this way becomes a more or less racket-shaped incision, the handle of it along the thigh being carried as low as possible under the circumstances of the case (see Fig. 100, B). The skin and fascia alone are first divided and dissected up for about two inches. The muscles are then cut across, care of course being taken to divide them as close to the pelvis as possible when the tumour is high up. The head of the bone is then rapidly disarticulated and pulled forcibly forward, when the muscles in the buttock are divided by a few strokes of the knife. The only vessels requiring ligature will be those in the buttock, and will consist essentially of the gluteal and sciatic vessels and their branches; they can be readily clamped without any material loss of blood. The results of this operation are very satisfactory. Comparatively short flaps can be made which ineet very nicely over the wound. The drainage tube should be placed in the lower and posterior angle of the wound and the dressing should be fixed on and the mackintosh applied as above described. The amount of blood lost is quite small, and the after-treat- ment is practically the same as that just described. The old method of performing amputation at the hip joint by means of antero-posterior flaps cut by transfixion has nothing whatever to re- commend it. Unless the bleeding be accurately controlled, a considerable amount of blood is lost, and the incision runs in such a direction, that it is almost impossible to keep the wound aseptic. Hence we have not thought it necessary to describe the operation.

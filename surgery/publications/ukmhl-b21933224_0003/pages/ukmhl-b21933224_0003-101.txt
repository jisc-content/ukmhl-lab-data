8r FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. fracture is then exposed, the finger inserted, all blood-clot cleared out, the joint washed out with a stream of 1-8000 sublimate solution, and any loose portions of bone that may be felt in the interior removed. The parts are then held in accurate apposition by an assistant while the surgeon runs a drill across the lower end of the humerus from one condyle to the other in a direction transverse to the long axis of the bone. A square ivory peg is then inserted and cut short, or, if the bone be too thin for this, a plated steel pin may be used; the subsequent treatment is the same as before. The limb is put up at right angles on an angular lateral splint reaching to the fingers; in the case of the internal condyle the fingers should be flexed so as to relax the muscles arising from it. Passive movement should be carried out from the end of the first week as already described. (4) Of fracture of internal epicondyle.â€”The fracture is here entirely outside the joint, and if there be no very marked separation, it is generally sufficient to put the arm up on an external angular splint, with the wrist and the fingers flexed so as to relax the flexor muscles; an attempt may be made to press the fractured portion of bone back into position by means of a suitable pad and strapping. If, however, there be any difficulty in getting the fragment back into place, it is easy to expose the tip of the condyle and fasten it in position by a silver wire.

AMPUTATIONS. 248 The racket-shaped incision.—Various operations are described for removal of the fingers, but the best for general use, particularly for amputations of the middle and ring fingers, is by means of the racket-shaped incision. The hand should be pronated, the other fingers bent and kept out of the way by an assistant, while the surgeon seizes the finger to be removed, flexes it at the raetacarpo-phalangeal joint through about half a right angle and, entering the point of the knife just above the knuckle, carries the incision directly downwards over the dorsal aspect of the phalanx Fig. 77.—Amputations of the Fingers. A. The ordinary racket-shaped incision for amputation at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. £. The same amputation, but with a notch made in front to improve the appearance. C. Incision for removal of a finger along with the head of its corresponding metacarpal • bone. The oblique section through the latter is shown by the thin dotted line. to a point opposite the centre of the web of the finger. From this point the incision passes forwards and very slightly downwards to the edge of the web. It then runs transversely across the front of the finger on a level with the crease on its palmar surface as far as the web on the opposite side, whence it is carried upwards to join the vertical incision from which it started (see Fig. 77, A). This incision should go down to the bone all round. The finger is then fully extended and the flaps are dissected up. If the tendons have escaped division in the first incision, they are put upon

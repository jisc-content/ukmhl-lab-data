CHAPTER VIII. FRACTURES OF THE LEG AND FOOT. FRACTURES OF THE BONES OF THE LEG. In the large majority of cases both the tibia and the fibula are broken ; sometimes, however, either bone may be broken separately. FRACTURES OB' THE TIBIA ALONE. Like most long bones, the tibia may be broken in various situations; the fractures are generally grouped into those of the upper end, the shaft, and the lower end. FRACTURES OF THE UPPER END OF THE TIBIA.—These injuries are seldom met with and do not require much description. The • fracture sometimes involves the articular end of the bone, as in falls from a height on to the feet, when the tibia is driven forcibly up against the condyles of the femur and the tuberosities of the former are split into several fragments; this is sometimes spoken of as a " compression fracture" of the upper end of the tibia. In other cases the spine of the tibia may be broken off, or in children there may be a separation of the epiphysis; the latter is an extremely rare injury. Fracture of the tibia just below the tubercle may also occur, and is generally due to severe direct injury, such as the passage of a heavy cart- wheel over the limb. The fracture may be either transverse or oblique; if transverse, there is usually little or no displacement owing to the breadth of the fractured surfaces. If the fracture be oblique, the obliquity is generally from above downwards and forwards, and the upper fragment projects somewhat anteriorly. Treatment.—When the case is one of compression fracture, an anaes- thetic should always be administered, firm extension employed and the fragments manipulated into position. When this has been done, it will be advisable to employ some exie/ision so as to prevent the tibia from being pressed up against the femur. The ordinary weight extension (see Fig. 14)

FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 117 attaching a suitable weigiit to the cord passing over the pulley; this will vary according to the muscularity of the patient. In an adult it is best to begin with six or seven pounds, and to increase it later if necessary. The outward rotation of the limb will also have to be corrected, and this is much more difficult to do than in the intra-capsular fracture, because any efficient arrangement is likely to cause so much friction that extension is interfered with. A good though somewhat complicated apparatus is shown in Fig. 42 ; the foot and lower part of the leg are put up on a posterior splint with a foot-piece at right angles, and this is so arranged that it runs in a groove in an iron frame standing upon the bed; rotation of the limb is thus prevented without undue friction. This apparatus is however not easily obtainable, and the following more simple method Fig. 43. -Method ok Preventing Rotation during Weight Extension for Fracture of the Femur. A plaster of Paris bandage is applied to the knee and made to include a piece of board placed behind the limb as shown in the figure. may be tried. A piece of wood three inches wide and nine inches long is placed behind the knee so that it projects beyond it on each side, and is then fastened firmly to the limb by a plaster of Paris bandage after the rotation has been corrected (see Fig. 43). This is a better apparatus than the long Liston with the transverse bar, which is often used for the same purpose, as it does not interfere so much with the extension. Another point of great importance is to fix the body so that the patient cannot move the hip joint, as otherwise movement will of course occur at the seat of fracture, and union may be interfered with. This is best done by applying a long Liston to the sound side; in addition, a sheet kept in position by sandbags on either side may be placed across the trunk.

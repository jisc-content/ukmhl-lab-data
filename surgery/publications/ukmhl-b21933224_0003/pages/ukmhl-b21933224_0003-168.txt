THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. 148 COMPOUND FRACTURE—This is comparatively rare in the patella; it may however be the result of direct injury and is then generally starred. Treatment.—This must of course be the treatment of an injury to the joint, and will consist in careful disinfection of the wound, removal of any loose fragments of bone, and sponging the fractured surfaces with pure carbolic acid, which must not be allowed to run into the joint. The latter is then washed out with a 1-40 carbolic acid solution, and subse- quently with a 1-8000 sublimate. The fragments of the patella may be then wired if necessary, and one drainage tube inserted into the joint and another between the bone and the skin. After-treatment.—The case must be carefully watched lest sepsis should occur; if it does, it will be necessary to make very free incisions into the joint and irrigate it with saline solution or boracic lotion until the violence of the inflammation has subsided. In some cases it may be necessary to excise the joint or amputate the limb. Further details on these points will be given under Wounds of Joints (see Part IV., Chap. XI.). VERTICAL FRACTURE.—This form of fracture is rare, and gene- rally results from direct blows upon the bone. The separation of the fragments is only slight as they bear no strain, and the fibrous structures over them are generally but little damaged. Treatment.—What has already been said above with regard to Com- minuted Fracture of the Patella applies equally well to this form, and need not be repeated here.

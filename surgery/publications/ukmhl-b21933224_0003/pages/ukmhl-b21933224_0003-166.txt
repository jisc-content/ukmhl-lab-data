146 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. be divided, union will occur readily enough, and no interference with the blood-supply need be feared. Lengthening the (juadriceps extensor.—The quadriceps should therefore be freely exposed; if this has not been properly ^one by the original incision, a median vertical incision should be made from the top of the convex one up the front of the thigh and the two flaps turned aside. A series of V-shaped incisions are then made through the muscle in an exactly similar manner to that already described for lengthening the triceps in fractures of the olecranon (see p. 88) ; two V's, each limb of A B Fig. 59. —Lfcngthenin'O the Quadriceps in Suture of the Patella. A shows the gap between the fragments and the serrated incision at the junction of the muscle with its tendon to allow the fragments to be approximated. The result is shown in B, where the adjacent edges of the serrations, above and below the line of incision, have been stitched together, and the apices of the two blunt cones thus formed have been sutured after the quadriceps tendon and the upper portion of the patella have been pulled down sufficiently to allow the fragments to come together. which is about two inches in length, are sufficient (see Fig. 59). With an incision made in this manner there is no fear of non-union of the muscle, nor is there any transverse fibrous scar which may subsequently stretch : union occurs very satisfactorily and the patella is permitted to come down. If the patella still does not come down sufficiently, it will generally be on account of some adhesions remaining in the supra-patellar pouch, which may be divided by introducing the knife on the flat into the pouch and cutting them. When the fragments have been brought into contact, they should be wired together in the manner described for recent fractures (see p. 137); but the wire should if possible be entered further from

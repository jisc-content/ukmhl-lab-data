294 AMPUTATIONS. to do this is to take a piece of mackintosh sufficiently long to extend from the middle line of the thigh in front to well beyond the middle line behind and broad enough to reach from the perineum down to the end of the stump. A broad piece of adhesive plaster of the same length as the piece of mackintosh is then taken and the edge of the mackintosh is fixed by means of it to the skin of the perineum. The same thing is done outside the dressings above and behind, and thus the mackintosh is firmly fixed and prevents their being soiled. A trough of Gooch's splint should be applied and it and the bandages fastened on by a spica; the lower end of the splint is raised and secured to a firm pillow.

The vertical incision is then added, and the upper end of the bone enucleated. B. Amputation by oval Jlaps (internal racket). The vertical incision is made first and lies over the femoral vessels. The dressing must be changed on the following day on account of the free oozing that will occur. Subsequent changes of dressings will be called for according to the amount of discharge; it is better to err on the side of changing the dressings too frequently than to do it too seldom; as a rule it will be found necessary to dress the stump every day for the first three or four days. The drainage tube may usually be left out in about a week.

This anterior incision is now deepened by dividing the muscles ; when these are healthy they may be divided close to the humerus and a flap of skin and muscle is turned inwards so as to expose the contents of the axilla, which of course consist of the vessels already divided above, and of fat and glands, which should be stripped down in one mass so that they can be removed along with the upper extremity. The arm and shoulder are next rotated outwards so as to expose the ventral aspect of the scapula, and the serratus magnus and the rhomboids are divided i Fig. 86.—Incisions for Removal of the Entire Upper Extremity. The thick line shows the incision on the anterior aspect of the trunk, the dotted one that on the posterior. near their insertion into the posterior border of the scapula ; the levator anguli scapulae is similarly treated. The posterior scapular artery, if not already secured, will be divided here and may be clamped. Raising the posterior flap.—The patient is now turned over upon the sound side, the arm pulled forcibly across the chest by an assistant, and the posterior incision which runs from the extreme outer end of the incision over the clavicle to the inferior angle of the scapula by the shortest route is marked out. As this incision is deepened and the flap is turned back, the few remaining muscular fibres are divided, and the extremity is thus removed. Although the main vessels have been already tied, numerous small points are found to bleed, and these should be clamped and tied. The greatest difficulty is met with at the posterior border of the scapula when the posterior

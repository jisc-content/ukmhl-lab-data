72 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BONES. by means of a weight of about three pounds, the hand being kept in a sling (see Fig. 29). At night the pulley extension is replaced. At the end of the third week the weight extension may be left off entirely, but the shoulder- cap should be kept on until five weeks have elapsed since the fracture. Fig. 2q.—Weight Extension in Fracture of the Uiter End of the Humerus. Extension afiptied while the patient is up. The weight is attached to the stirrup and a shoulder-cap and wrist-sling are put on. At night the two latter can be taken off and the extension applied as in the preceding figure. Mechanical fixation of fragments.—If in spite of these measures the displacement recurs, there need be no hesitation in cutting down upon and fixing the fragments in proper position. This will be more especially called for in the rarer cases in which the fracture runs obliquely upwards through the tuberosities. A skiagram should be taken two or three days after the injury, without removing the splints, and if much over-riding be found, operative interference should be resorted to. For this purpose an incision is made along the anterior border of the deltoid, curving outwards and backwards below; the muscle is firmly retracted, and its insertion may be partially detached to allow of proper access to the fracture. The fractured ends are then brought into position by means of extension carried out by an assistant. The ends of the bone are next fixed by a couple of pegs, or, still better, by two fine plated screws (see p. 51). The flap containing the deltoid is then replaced, and the divided portion of the muscle united by a few catgut sutures (see Part II., p. 199). A large dressing is applied, and the limb put up again in the shoulder-cap and fixed to the side in the manner described above. Of fracture of the anatomical neck.—Here good union is hardly to be expected, and the chances of its occurrence are not sufficiently good

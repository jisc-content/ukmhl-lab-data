372 WOUNDS. in arranging direction of cuts and position of -wound. A drainage tube is a foreign body -whicli may itself cause pain and irritation. As a rule, it should be gently removed, squeezed, and washed every dressing. It is useless to try to squii't car- bolic lotion through seven or eight inches of a drainage-tube riddled with holes and lying in a wound. Before removing to clean, tie a piece of sUk to it. Leave this in the wound, to afterwards use as guide for replacement. Be veiy gentle. Very rarely do any severe wounds, of the soft parts alone, i-equire amputation. But they may do so when (1) even recovery would only be with so miich deformity or loss of function that the part would be worse than useless; or (2) when the injury is so extensive and serious that gangrene and death are threatened. Injm-ies complicated with division of large ar- teries, with much contusion, and in the lower extremities of adult, and, much more, of aged people, are of this nature. No verbal rules can do instead of experience in deciding in such cases. Here even the master-surgeon steers with perplexity between Scylla and Charybdis.

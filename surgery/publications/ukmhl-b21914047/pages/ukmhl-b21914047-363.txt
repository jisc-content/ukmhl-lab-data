coy ULCEES. z 2 lations large, readily bleeding, oedematous. Discharge, thin, greenish pus. Treatment.—That of scrofula. Locally : stimu- lant. Ung. Hydrarg. oxid. rubri, nnguentum plumbi, lotio iodi (tinet. iodic aqua), on strips of lint. Iodoform. Scorbutic Ulcers occur in the course of scurvy, and are covered with crusts of the characteristic blood-clot deposit of scurvy. Indolent and livid. Vide Scurvy. Gouty Ulcers.—Superficial, indolent, occur in gouty parts, especially over gouty deposits. Discharge itself leaves a chalky precipitate. Treatment.—Water dressing. In absence of in- fiammation, sol. argent, nit. (gr. v, aquse §j) may be used. Syphilitic Ulcers.—Primary syphilitic ulcers (i.e., chancres) may occur on lips, hands, &c. For their characteristics vide Syphilis. Secondary eruptions rarely ulcerate : they arc known by their concomitants. Tertiary are almost all the cutaneous ulcers named syphilitic. Commence in two ways : 1, cutaneously (usually in rupia); 2, subcutaneously (a gumma ulcerating outwards). The two varieties agree in occurring anywhere, in having abrupt edges, in often being surrounded by a red areola, in being associated with a syphilitic history (perhaps merely congenital), and in benefiting by antisyphilitic treatment, especially iodide of potassium ; but they difier con- siderably. 1. That ivhich begins superficially has for its favoui-ite locality the trunk. Shape : annular, crescentic, or circular. Size : various. Base : level, crimson. , Granulations : small or absent. Discharge concretes into scabs, often rupial in cha- racter. Not generally simultaneous with any other syphilitic manifestation. One of the earliest tertiary manifestations. 2. Deep tertiary syphiHtic ulcers are caused by a gumma finding its way outwards through ulceration of the skin. Locality : anywhere—usually limbs near the large joints. Shape i rounded. Size : about an inch ; usually multiple. Ed"es :' abrupt. Base : excavated, often covered with ' gummy deposit' sloughed. They have to be diagnosed from strumous ulcers a^he latter have a pink surrounding area, the former usually a dusky red one. Treatment of tertiary syphilitic ulcer — Locally : stimulant mercurial ointments, e.g., ung. hyd oxid rubri, or ung. hyd. nitric-oxid. or lotio nigra; iodkle of'potas-

194 INFLAMMATION. Sanderson. But althougli all tlie leucocytes observed outside the vessels in the earlier stages of inflammation have ^jrobably escaped from the vessels, there is still reason to believe that later accumulations of them are partially due to proliferation of the extra-vascular corpuscles. 3. Stasis.—The phenomena of stasis occur at an imcertain time during the course of inflammation, but they are not, as is sometimes stated, the first in order of occurrence. They are twofold : firstly, the blood-current stops altogether, after getting gradually slower and then oscillating; secondly, the coloured corpuscles cohere to one another, and ad- here to the sides of the vessels till they form an accumulation so dense that the capUlaries seem to contain no liquor sanguinis, but only corpuscles. As similar occurrences take place even when mUk is substituted for blood, and as the blood drawn in inflammation shows no special arrangement of its corpuscles, it is assumed that the phenomena of stasis are due to a changed condition of the walls of the blood-vessels.' Structural changes wliich take place in constituents of inflamed tissues—In non-vascular tissue, such as that of the cornea and of cartilage, the proper cornea and cartilage corpuscles proli- ferate But numbers of leucocytes migrate from the vessels around the cornea into its substance. In cartUage the cartilage- cells multiply by division, and then cause the absorption of the stroma in which they lie. In tendon and in muscle similar changes have been observed. In the case of parts lined with epithelium, such as mucous and serous membranes and glands, it is probable that the greater part of the corpuscles of the in- flammatory new formation are escaped leucocytes; but at east in the case of epitheHal membranes, proliferation of epithehum appears to have been observed. j i-v^ Further changes are described under headmgs noticed mthe '°"S:r^>/^>—^^^^ " I If the vascdar walls .^rmit rnu.l^J^e^^-^^^^^^^^ them, the speed of that which «mams m the vessei . ^^^^^^^ easy to see how retardation of absence^of the normal force which srhTthr^ 1878, p. 299.

148 HEMORRHAGE. such as the femoral, the rotation should be repeated till the sense of resistance has ceased ; the ends should not be twisted ofif. In small arteries the number of rotations is of no impor- tance, and their ends may be twisted off or not, as the surgeon prefers.' ' When the vessels are atheromatous, or diseased, fewer rotations of the forceps are requii-ed, the inner tunics of the vessels being so brittle as to break up at once and incurve.' The effects of torsion practically resemble those of the ligature, but the inner coats cui-l up more in the former case, sometimes forming a regular valve. Though torsion leaves no dead foreign body in the wound like a piece of ligatiu-e, yet the bruised end of a twisted artery is less likely to hve and form adhesions than the less damaged end of a ligatured artery. Acupressure has been noticed separately. See Acupressure. Gomjyression.—Several forms :—l. Tourniquet j 2, digital; 3 ordinary bandages with or without graduated compress; 4, elastic bandaging. Chief kinds of tourniquet are Petit's and Signorini's ; Petit's is most used for operations, and consists of a webbing band, with a pad and a screw for tightening. It is usual to place a small compress, made of a small soft roll of bandage or of lint over the artery to be compressed. Signorini's tourniquet is used chiefly in the treatment of aneurism, and it consists of two curved metal arms, with a screw Huge between the two, and a pad for the artery at the extremity of one. Lister's tom^niquet for the abdominal aorta, is on the principle of Signormi s. In applying any tourniquet it is necessary to adjust it with pat deliberation and care, otherwise the pad ib very liable to shp off the artery. One should mention here the lever used by Davy, with great success, to compress the iliac arteries, per rectum Digital Compression is preferable in almost every case, 1, because of the Uability of all instruments to slip out of place; 2 because the human finger is so delicate, tender, and e -ticwh^n compared with a rigid tourniquet or bandage Bu it is <hfficu t to obtain for this purpose, and expensive ^^^^ ^'^ ^^^^^^^ In some cases, e.g., haemorrhage from -te-'^l --^^^^ rvnx no other form of compression might be apphcab e.

A calculus may consist of several of these materials in layers, or of one only. 1, Lithate of ammonia; 2, lithic or ui-ic acid; 3, oxalate of lime; 4, xanthic or uric oxide; 5, cystic oxide; 6, phosphate of Kme; 7, triple phosphate. For the causes of the presence of an abnormal amount of some of these substances in the urine, see table of urinary deposits. The nucleus or centre of each calculus may be formed first in the kidney or in the bladder, or it may be a foreign body. Poverty, certain localities, and the male sex are great predisposing causes of stone in the bladder. Negi-o race remarkably exempt.

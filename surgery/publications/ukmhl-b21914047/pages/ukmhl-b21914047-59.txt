DISEASES OF BONES. 45 considerable extent : this occurs especially in strumous periostitis. Then again, in other cases of chronic periostitis, a soft fluctuating swelling forms, consisting, not of pus, but of granulations spring- ing from carious bone ; these cases are often also strumous. Patliology of Caries.—Chronic inflammation causes the cor- puscular and vascular elements of the soft parts of bones to increase at the expense of the earthy parts; the young cells seem, as it were, to corrode the walls of the lacunae, &c., in which they lie; these corrosions, spreading and uniting, may cause de- struction to an indefinite extent; the bone thus corroded is dis- solved, and is either absorbed or flows away in the discharges. Arotmd the region of cailes is sometimes a zone of sclerosis, i.e., of bone in which the inflammatory new material has ossifled between the trabecule of the original bone. The distinctive cha- racters oi strumous caries are thus given by Walsh am [Surgical Pathology, p. 16) : 'It is characterised by the tendency of the inflammatory products to undergo caseous degeneration, by the extensive destruction of the aflTected par-t, by the softened, fatty, and oily condition of the bone around, by little tendency to the formation of new bone, and by the feeble efforts towards repair.' Pathology of Necrosis.—Dead bone is bloodless, and either white, or else darkened by the action of air, pus, or blood; on the surface lately continuous with living bone it is rough and corroded; but on the free surface, usually smooth. The process of separation of necrosed bone is as follows : granulations form at the plane of contact of living and dead bone, and these granu- lations dissolve the earthy medium still uniting the dead to the living bone, thus setting the former free ; the soft tissues in con- tact with dead bone loosen from it everywhere, and often a layer of pus intervenes ; then the dead bone lies in an abscess cavity. When part or whole of the shaft of a long bone necroses, these same neighboming soft parts, most especially the periosteum, proceed, as a rule, to build a shell of new bone, within which the necrosed bone lies ] this shell is perforated in one or more places by cloacae (passages for the egress of discharge); the piece of necrosed bone is called the sequestrum; it takes months to separate from the living bone; it is eventually either discharged or absorbed, or removed by operation, or it may remain even for

162 INJURIES OF HEAD. Neglect of rest and of temperance after head-injuries is very likely to excite inflammation. Pathology—Congestion of the parts inflamed. Firstly, yellowish lymph and then pus appears on the inflamed membranes. Cerebral substance may soften and break down. Serous efi'usion into ventricles. "When the exciting injury is not very deep, e.g. most punctured fractures, the membranes are chiefly affected; but when it is general or deep, e.g. contusion of brain, the cerebral substance may be the chief seat of inflammation. Although the appearances are most marked at the actual seat of injury, yet traumatic encephalitis generally spreads to a great part of the brain and its membranes. In chronic cases, parietal and visceral layers of arachnoid cohere. The amount of cerebral congestion is estunated 2}ost mortem by the number and size of the red points visible on section of the hemispheres. This test is not satisfactory, for it is influenced by the relative fluidity of the blood and the pressure of serous effusion in the ventricles.—>S'i^«s.—l, Acute. Severe pain in head, over-sensitiveness to light and sound, noises in ears, one or both pupils contracted, partial spasms and paralyses, epilepti- form convulsions, usually, or at all events at first, unilateral; fever, pulse frequent, or variable, temperatui-e raised slightly at first, and raised more if suppiuration come on.

In comatose stage pupils eventually dilate. 2, Chronic. When it comes on long after receipt of injury, there may be premonitory signs, e.^., irritable temper, headaches, &c.

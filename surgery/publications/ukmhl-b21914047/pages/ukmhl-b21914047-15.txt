INDEX OF SUI^GEEY. Abdomen, Contusions of.—Always examine patient very carefully, but gently. Diagnose whether the viscera are injured or not. Three things protect against injury to the deeper struc- tm-es, viz. : 1, thick and muscular abdomiual walls; 2, empty state of the viscera ; and 3, the patient's foreseeing and expecting the blow. The parietal effects of a blow on the abdomen are, 1, rup- ture of muscle; 2, mere bruising (which, however, may be very serious in extent); 3, rupture of the peritoneum, with consequent extravasation of blood into peritoneal cavity. Rupture of a muscle causes temporary paralysis, swelling, &c. Sometimes the separation of the parts may be felt. Abscess may foUow contusion, burrow widely, and cause most trouble- some sinuses. Haemorrhage from ruptured peritoneum may be fatal. The collapse so produced is distinguished from the effect of ruptured intestine by the absence of great pain and vomiting, and by positive sigas of internal hemorrhage. A blow on the abdomen may cause serious and even fatal collapse without visceral injiuy, possibly by damaging the ab- dommal sympathetic system. Treatment.—Attend to collapse internal haemorrhage, inflammation, and suppuration on genera! prmciples. Avoid purgatives. In case of peritonitis, use leeches, warm moist applications, and a liberal allowance of opium. Mercury in case of sthenic inflammation When there is znjury to a viscus, the particular one injured depends chiefly upon the place where the force is applied. Each viscus

WOUNDS. 371 practice of using lint soaked in carbolised oil as a protective is um-easonable; for the lint obstructs the absoi-ptive power of the oakum, whilst the carbolic acid is as ii-ritating as the tar in the oakum. Rarely should the wound, excepting when fresh, be syi-inged or washed—it cannot be kept too dry. Vide Anti- septic Treatment. Read Gamgee on the 'Treatment of Wounds,' an authority on oakum and cotton-wool dressings, but unjust to Lister and his methods. Without antiseptic treat- ment, grand statistical results have been obtained by vaiious sui-geons; but, considering how many things affect the success of surgical practice, e.g., experience, observation, judgment re- source, manual dexterity, pluck, and, perhaps above all, patience and enthusiasm, not to mention endemic and epidemic influences It IS certain that mere statistics prove little for or against any system of dressing woimds, unless those statistics extend over long periods of time, different localities, and immense numbers of cases. And, even then, they should not be permitted to over- rule other evidence such as presents itself to the surgeon who m London at all events, watches any small series of wounds ii^ detail, of which some are treated antiseptically and others not For even the statistics of an honest observer have not reall^ the force of mathematical certainty.

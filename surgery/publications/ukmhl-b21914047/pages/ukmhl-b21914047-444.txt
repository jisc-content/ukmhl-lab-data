420 EYE, DISEASES OF. Indirect method shows size of disc to diminish on with- drawing the lens from patient's eye. Direct method.—When oblique mirror is used close to the patient's eye, and the accommodation both of patient and observer relaxed, no clear detail of fundus can be made out without the aid of a convex lens. The strength of the lens thus required to make quite clear the detail of fundus gives an exact estimate of the degree of hypermetropia. 3. By mea/ns of Test-types and Test-glasses.—See if patient can read Nos. 6 to 100 Snellen at 6 metres. Then, if he can read the same as well or better with a convex glass, the highest glass with which he gets the best vision is a measure of his manifest hypermetropia. In children, and in all cases where spasm of the ciliary muscle is suspected, it is necessary to paralyse the accommodation by atropine drops, in order to obtain the latent as well as the manifest, that is, the total hypermetropia. Treatment.—Having found the degree of hypermetropia, order spectacles to be worn as follows: 1. In children and young adults order the constant use of glasses both for near and distant vision; the strength of these should be equal to all the manifest hypermetropia pkis half the latent. Patient may complain of inconvenience, but should persevere. 2. In per- sons over forty years of age order glasses as directed under presbyopia (see Presbyopia). Astigmatism is Regular or Irregular. Regular Astigmatism is that condition in which the refrac- tion is different in different meridians of the same eye; the two principal meridians being always at right angles to each other. Irregular Astigmatism is that condition in which there are different degrees of refraction in different parts of the various meridians. Regular Astigmatism may exist in five different forms. 1. Simple Myopic—One meridian emmetropic, and the other myopic. 2. Simple Eypermetropic.—One meridian emmetropic, the other hypermetropic.

44 DISEASES OF BONES. Bones, Diseases of, resemble those of the soft tissues, but are remarkable for the extreme slowness with which the patho- logical changes usually take place. Note.—The pathology of the varieties of inflammation in bone and periosteum will be given collectively, for the sake of convenience and clearness. Bone, Atrophy of.—Causes.—Injury, e.g., fracture; chronic inflammation; disuse, e.g., in the case of the bone of a stump; old age, e.g., atrophy of the lower jaw ; pressure, e.g., that of a tumour. Pathology.—The bone becomes not only smaller, but its cancellous and medullary spaces enlarge; a certain amount of fatty degeneration is frequent. Pathology of Osteal and Periosteal Inflammations.— Pathology of Acute Periostitis.—Attacks chiefly the long boues, especially the femur ; medulla may be coincidently inflamed ; in a typical case, in which both periosteum and medulla are aSected, the A'essels of each are highly injected, and the intervascular tissue infiltrated with young corpuscles ; this stage may end in complete resolution, in ossification of some of the inflammatory new formation; or, as in most cases unfortunately, it may end in suppuration; then the skin reddens, the oedema becomes marked, and neighbouring joints swell; the suppuration separates the periosteum, not usually from the whole shaft, but frequently from half of it, though often only on part of the circumference ; except in rare instances in small children necrosis is now inevit- able.—See Necrosis of Bone. Pathology of Chronic Periostitis.—It is often accompanied by superficial inflammation of the bone itself. The two layers of the periosteum (internal, fibrous, and external, cellulo- vascular) cannot be separated from each other, but are swollen, infiltrated with young cells, and traversed by dilated capillaries; they are easily sepai-ated from the adjacent bone, whose surface is generally covered with small nodules of new bone; the general opinion is that these nodules (osteophytes) gi'ow from the perios- teum ; periostitis, with the formation of these osteophytes and without suppuration, is usually syphilitic. "When suppuration occurs it may be without any destruction of bone, caries or necrosis; but usually the bone is rough and gnawed, often to a

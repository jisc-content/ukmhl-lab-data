PEEFACE. vii as it is, deals with questions of life and death, can scarcely he excused; they can only be lamented and condemned. But as I am convinced that it will do much more good than evil, and I believe I have done iny best, I publish the work hopefully. These shortcomings would have been much greater if it had not been for the help in revision which has been given by Messrs. Alfred Street, Mills, Dunn, Alfred Back, Firth, and Charles Paget. ]\Ir. Street has gone over the whole book. . I cannot thank him too warmly. My friend and pupil, Mr. Charles H. Taylor, has made the Index of Names. Messrs. Doran, Lyons, and Juler have added contri- butions on Ovariotomy, Toothache, and Ophthalniic Siurgery respectively. ]\Ir. Juler desires acknowledgment to be made of the help given by Mr. W. Adams Frost and Mr. W. Langdon, in the revision of the article on Ophthalmic Surgery. Finally, I will express a hope that the practitioner, as well as the student, wiU occasionally find the book useful as a handy Kttle work of reference. 20 Princes Steeet, Hanovee Squaee, W.

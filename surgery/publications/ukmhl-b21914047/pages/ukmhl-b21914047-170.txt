Naturcd Checks to Hcemorrliage. —AxtQvisX haemorrhage is stopped naturally by 1, active contraction of vessel; 2, passive contraction, consequent on decrease of total quantity of blood in system; 3, weakening of heart caused by loss of blood; 4, ob- struction of vessel by clot. The first three are, one or other, more or less, accessory to the operation of the fourth cause. Yenous haemorrhage is stopped partly by causes similar to those which check arterial htemorrhage, and partly by the action of the valves in the veins. Capillary htemorrhage is stopped by the con- traction of the connective or other tissues in which the vessels are embedded, and by coagulation. Hence, when these tissues are diseased, capillary and also parenchymatous hemorrhage may be very troublesome. Pa<7io%2/.—Natural changes in and around a wounded vessel, a. If wound be partial and trans- verse, the wound gapes; bleeding is considerable and has to be checked ultimately by clotting, which may not occur tiU syncope comes on and predisposes to it. 5. Wound longitudinal. Wouiad does not tend to gape. HEemorrhage is, therefore, more easily checked by coagulation and contraction, c. Wound completely dividing artery. 1, The ends of the artery retract into the sheath, sometimes cm4ing or twisting up; 2, the ends contract; 3 coagulation takes place within the artery; 4, coagulation, occurs ovitside the artery, within and sometimes ^.athout the sheath; 5, organisation of the clot or of part of it; finally, cicatricial contraction occurs in the newly-organised tissue. Recurrent hemorrhages are caused by the returning force of the circulation, which, when a patient becomes warm m bed, may be enough to open a vessel not firmly closed. ^ ^ . ^, General Symptoms of Ecemorrhage.-l, Face first pale, then blue; 2, pulse sinks; 3, temperature sinks; 4, dizziness; 5, nausea or vomiting; 6, eyes dazzled; 7,noises mears; 8 faint, ing and unconsciousness ; 9, either the patient recovers ox gets worse.

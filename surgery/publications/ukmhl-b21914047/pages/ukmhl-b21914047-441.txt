Thus, suppose a hypermetrope of 2 dioptres, what strength of lens would be required to correct his near vision at the age of fifty 1 He will require first 2 D. to correct the hypermetropia, and, by the above table, we see that 2 D. would be the strength of lens required if he were emmetropic. Therefore, 2 + 2 = 4 D., or let X be the amount of hypermetropia expressed in dioptres, and a;' the strength of lens required according to age, then xB.+x^ D. will be the strength of the spectacles required for near vision. In myopia presbyopia comes on later than in emmetropia, because for the same amount of accommodation the near-point is always nearer than in the normal eye. In very high degrees of myopia (over 4-5 dioptres) the patient will never become so presbyopic as to require convex glasses for near vision, because in a state of repose the eyes are adapted for a shorter distance than 22 cm. He may, however, require concave glasses for near as well as for distant vision (see Myopia). Suppose a myope of 3 D. sixty years old, what spectacles would he require 1 We see by the table that, if emmetropic, he would require 4 D., and we know that he has myopia = — 3 D Therefore +4-3= + l D. wiU be the strength of spectacles required for near vision. Myopia (Short Sight) is that condition of refraction in which parallel rays come to a focus in front of the retina, the eye being at rest.

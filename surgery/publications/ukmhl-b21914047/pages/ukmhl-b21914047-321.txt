SYPHILIS. 297 Skin SypMlides. SypUUtic Exanthemata.—Ynvieties 1, erythematous sypHlide; 2, papular syphiKde; 3 pustular sypMlide; 4, vesicular syphilide; 5, squamous, and b, pig- mentary syphilide. General diagnostic peculiarities of syphi- lides:-l, copper colour; 2, pigmentary stains left behind; d, indistinctness of type {e.g. in the same subject are seen transi- tional forms between roseola and psoriasis, and few or no patches which are distinctly either one or the other); 4, situation {e.cj. syphilitic psoriasis is not confined to the knees and elbows, as is so often the case with simple psoriasis); 5, shape of groups of eruption, usually circular or crescentic; 6, absence of itching; 7, unusual thickness of crusts and scabs. Erythematous SypMlide. Syphilitic JSoseoZa.—Rose-coloured spots, or red and slightly raised patches. Generally commences on trunk. Course slow. In diagnosing from non-syphilitic erythemas consider the histoiy of the patient and the state of the glands. Prognosis.—Usually disappears under a month's mercurial treatment. Said to augur rather a mild attack of syphilis. Papular SypMlide.—Go^nperj-Ted papules, chiefly on trunk, but also on limbs, forehead, and hairy scalp. Leaves no per- manent scar. Pustular SypMlide. Syphilitic Impetigo.—Appears at alater stage than the preceding syphilides, but not so late as syphilitic rupia, which indeed is a tertiary affection. The pustules sup- purate, scab, and leave scars. It lasts for several months, and might at first be mistaken for small-pox, and, later on, for common acne. Vesicidar SypMlide.—Extremely rare. Squamous Syphilides. Syphilitic Psoriasis.—Spots rarely large, colour coppery, scales thin. Fissures. Frequently palmar and plantar in situation. Palmar psoriasis characterised by ' slightly prominent, rounded spots, of a coppery colour, covered with hard greyish confluent scales, which in some cases take the form of cracked patches, and give rise to chaps and fissures, which are often painful.' Characteristic brown border at edges of patches. Pigmentary Syphilide.—Greyish or cofiee-with-milk eor

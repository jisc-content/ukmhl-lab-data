A TREATISE ufoNâ€™ 102 * J Befides the abovementioned ufe of the precipitate, for the purpofe of bringing foul ulcers into a good flate, it is not unfrequently neceflary in order to pre- ferve them fo, and to promote incarnation ; and even in this view, it often anfwers much better by being fprinkled upon the fore, than mixed up with the digeftive. I know how much that mode has been objected to by the late M\ Sharps who both as a writer and praditioner, I fliould be more inclined to envy than to cenfure. Neverthelefs, experience is the beft teftimony, and has demonftrated to me how much, and to how great advantage, ulcers on the legs will endure the ufe of precipitate. Perhaps, an inattention to this, has been one occafion of the very unfavourable opinion furgeons have always entertained of fore legs, and of the difficulty of their cure j but fo various are the inftances I have feen of the fpecific power of precipitate, in different kinds of ulcers, where every common application had been ufed to no purpofe, that I can recommend it with more confidence than ever. I do not fpeak merely of foul, or callous ulcers, but of thofe very aptly denominated dyfepulotici wherein nothing has appeared particularly amifs, but there has been no applied, but thla is only an opinion he has taken up from fomc cafes, in which they had not proved beneficial; for he obferves, they often occafion fo great heat in the part as to induce fuppu- ration in cold tumors, and that in almoft every cafe where they have been ufeful, they have raifed more or lefs inflammation, and have often occafioned very confidcrable pain for fome days. dif.

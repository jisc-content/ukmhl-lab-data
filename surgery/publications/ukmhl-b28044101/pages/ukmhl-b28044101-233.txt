On the other hand, if there be not a very early and confiderable abatement of the firft fymptoms, however flowly the^procefs may go on, the breaft will feldom fail to fuppurate. In this ftate, therefore, the plan ought very foon to be chaneed, in order to forward the work of maturation. And this, wherever the pulle will allow of bleeding, will often be haftened by taking away a fmall quan- tity of blood, once or twice, from the arm; though the patient fliould already have been let blood with a very different view.

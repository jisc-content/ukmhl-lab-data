2o8 CASES AND REMARKS and for this purpofe a folution of manna and Rochelle I'alt may be as proper as any other. It (hould be given and repeated until it produces the defired eftedt; or, if it flaould be flow in its operation, a few grains of calomel will probably fuc- ceed. After a proper application hath been made to the injured limbj when the pa- tient has been bled (if it appears necelTary) and his bowels have been opened : the next defirable objedl will be to eafe or mitigate the pain. In every cafe of this kind, pain fliould be relieved with the moft ftudious care; for as inflammation occafions pain, fo pain, in its turn, increafes inflamma- tion : and thus the caufe and effedl are per- petually augmenting each other. In one view, therefore, the antiphlogiftic plan feems admirably calculated to anfwer fuch purpofe; but this alone will not fucceed, when the parts are in a very irritable ftate, without the ufe of opium. At whatever time, or upon whatever occafion, opium is given with an intention to remove pain.

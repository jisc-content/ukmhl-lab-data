76 A treatise UPON that Aich arguiTiCnt appears to manifeft difadvantage, and may be thought to be little more than a circulus in tircuh; however, it is confonant to various maxims that were never dlfputed : for inllance, as a very nourifli- ing diet would prove hurtful, where proportionable txercife were negleded, and vice verla, hard labor without adequate nourifliment, but taken together, contribute to the health of the fubjedt; fo clearly has experience proved to me, the faiutary effedfs of tight bandage and exercife united, in regard to the ulcers in queftion. Notwithftanding what has been here and elfew'here advanced on this fubjedf, I have been fomewhat fur- prifed, fince the firft appearance of this tradf, to find that fo attentive and judicious a pradlitioncr as Mr. Belly fliould in the lafl edition of this treatife upon ulcers, fo ftrongly inculcate the neceffity both of le- nient applications and reff, in the cure of ulcers on the low'er extremities ; without offering one argument in fupport of the latter, or attempting an anfvver to thofe I had advanced. Having barely mentioned my opinions, he obferves, (p. 203) that he has tried every method that has been publiflicd to the world, and has fuccceded in all of them; but that he finds no cures fo eafily or fpeedily obtained, nor any tenir la jiartie malade dans lepliis grand repos; le moindre mouve- roent eft capable dV faire des teraillemens, qui aiigmentrnt la doiileur et la fuppuration, dctruifcnt les cbaiis tendres qui renai- ft'ent, et brifent les premiers lineamens de la cicatrice.‚Äù Ti'aite lirs f ti/uturs ct dcs Ulceres, that

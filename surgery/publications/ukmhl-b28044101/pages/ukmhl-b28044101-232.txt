This is the moment to prevent the appre- hended mifehief, as a very Ihort delay renders the means ineffeftual; the Ikin foon becomins difeo- loured, and the breaft greatly enlarged. To remedy this, immediate recourfe ftiould be had to bleeding, and to laxative and anodyne medicines; but above all tofedative applications, which are ufualiy found to be the moft powerful difeutients. Sometimes, however, folutions of crude fal ammoniac, with the addition of a good quantity of fpirit, and if the inflammation be very recent, fome vinegar, will be more advife- able than fltturnine remedies.

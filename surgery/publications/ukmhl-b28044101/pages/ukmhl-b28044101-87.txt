57 ULCERS OF THE LEGS. sn almoft cauftlc difcharge, and are therefore intole- rably painful, and difficult of cure under lenient appli- cations, are frequently dried up in a very fliort time, by a few flight touches of the lunar cauftic ; which by deflroying fome little inflamed gland, removes the fource of the evil at once. In regard to the bracing, or aflrin'gent applications I have mentioned, the propriety of them \vill appear beft in their proper place. It will only be neceffary at prefent to remark, that thefe aflringents are dif- ferent from thofe In common ufe, both becaufe they do not leave a drynefs on the fkin, and becaufe they are of a very deterfive nature ; neither are they made of fuch a ftrength as to fupprefs the difcharge, but rather to brace the furface of fome particular ulcers : befides, the ufe of them is not conflant, and Is feldom long continued. I COME next to the fubjetfl of Bandage.â€”It may be an empirical, but Is no bad argument, when the integrity and common fenfe of the fpeaker are not fufpedted, to fay, that fadVs are flronger than rea- foning; they are ftubborn things even to a proverb, and they fpeak in favour of very tight bandage. I have applied it to the corpulent, heavy and inactive, to the young of an inflammatory habit, to the aged, to the pale and leucophlegmatic, nor have ever re- pented the ufe of it when accompanied with exercife; which every one will fee, has fome tendency to coun- teradl the pofliblc 111 efiefts of fuch applications to the extremities. It is true, we have known tight rolling and the laced-flocking prove hurtful to fome people.

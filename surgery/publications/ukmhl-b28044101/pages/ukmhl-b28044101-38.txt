In proportion to the different diftance of parts from this centre of life, the circulation of the blood is more languid, the ani- mal heat is at a lower temperature, and the animal functions are more liable to interruption. But the healing powers depend greatly on the general, or re- lative vigor of the fyftem: if therefore, the vital ener- gy diminifhes, at a diftance from the centre, fhall we be furprifed to find, that the vis medicatrix (which owes its, falutary power to the fame caufe) is dimiqiflied likewlfe} II.

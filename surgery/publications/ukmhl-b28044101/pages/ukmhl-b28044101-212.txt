3<5 DISORDERS cicuta, a remedy not in very common ufe, but well adaped to many old and obftinate difeafes of the eye. NO common complaint is oftentimes more difEcult of cure than affedtions of the eye-lids. Tbefe are fome- times attended with a diftention and rednefs of the vef- fels of the eye, and fometimes not; but vifion is always impaired. In fome inftances, likewife, the edges of the eye-lids difchargc a very acrid matter, which ex- coriates the cheeks; and in others, the lids are red and ulcerated, but almoft dry. â–  In thefe cafes, it is well known, that a cautious mfe of the lunar cauftic will fometimes effedt an almoft inftantaneous cure; but I believe, it has not been often enough noticed, that a turning inwards of the eye-lafhes is fometimes the foie caufe of this very ob- ftinate complaint: the remedy for which is fuf- ficiently obvious. In other inftances of the lippitudo, the common mercurial ointment, or that with red precipitate, proves very ferviceable, bur more efpe- cially,. the unguentum citriiium, prepared as before- mentioned, a remedy perhaps fcarely to be equalled for this, and many other fmall ulcers. I have alfo feen great good effedted, in a few days, by a very old remedy made ufe of frequently in Si. Bartho- lomew's hofpital, and for which I am obliged to Mr, Boitj and doubt not his permiflion for giving the prefeription; though my own experience, indeed, goes to a preference of the unguentum citrinum.

I HAVE adopted this term, for the want of a better, to dd'eribe an angry, fuperficial ulcer, which is lometimes likewife accompanied with an affedtion of the fkin that will fpread over the greater part of the leg; and chiefly attacks the aged and infirm. It ahvays furniflies abundance of thin, and very acrid difeharge, efpecially if the furrounding ikin is af- fedted, rendering the limb intolerably painful; and when the dreflings are removed, frequently emits a fleam like boiling water. I have known poultices and fomentations ufed a long time to no purpofe ; the ulcer either not, healing at all, or breaking out in frefli places almofl immediately, and the pain flill increafing. Purges likewife are here of no ufe ; as to medicines, opium and bark Teem of the greateft avail: the pain muft be mitigated, and the habit be flrengthened. The dreflings flrould likewife be cal- culated to prevent fluxion to the parr, or but little advantage will be gained ; and in this fpecies, I have never feen any harm from fupprefling the difeharge, though the remedies fliould increafe the pain at their firfl application.

6^ Upon GA^NGRENE. Gangrenes are frequently attended with much true inflammation, and fometimes are preceded and caufed by it; and in this cafe, however rapid the progrefs of the gangrene may be, both the bark and other tonics, with every kind of cordial, ought entirely to be refrained from; and bleeding, laxatives, and cool- ing medicines be exhibited in their ftead, with emol- lient fomentations and cataplafms, (not applied too hot) to abate the fenfibility of the part, and promote fnppuration* After thefe evacuations, an opiate fliould generally be adminiftered at night, (and is proper in every gangrene where the pain is confider- able) ; and thefe means fliould be continued as long (though rarely many days) as the inflammatory dia* thefis fliall evidently prevail. For fo long as this lhall continue, the blood remain fizy, and perhaps the bowels coftive, loading them with bark, w^hich the ftomach cannot digeft, is only adding fuel to fire, by augmenting the load, or increafing the action of the fyftem, and rendering the partially obflrudted veflels totally impervious. But there is often local inflammation and great upon ulcers) I had not then feen the lad edition of Mr. Bell’s Sur- gery, in which are many valuable praftical obfervations, and ex- cellent diftindtions of gangrenes. Had he more completely accom- plifhed this defign, and he himfelf had experience of the great ad-* vantagesarifing from a due recourfe toopium, in very many cafes, 1 had thought the expediency of thefe hints entirely fuperfeded. But Mr. Bell does n® more than barely mention that remedy, in a note, as having been recommended upon the authority of Mr* Pott. pain.

The fadt, in- deed, is, that the little apertures may be very eafily and certainly kept open, as long as there remains any thing to be difcharged from parts with which they communicate, and that frelh impofthumations will not be formed, but in cafes where other parts of the breaft are in an obftrudted and diftempered ftate, and not yet inclined to fuppuration ; in which cafe, letthefirft abfcefs be opened, and treated in what- ever manner it may, new impofthumations will be formed, and, indeed, in this cafe, are to be defired. Whereas, when other difeafed parts have commu- nicated with the firft abfcefs, I have without difficulty kept an orifice (not larger than a pinâ€™s head) for many weeks open, till the various indurated parts having fuppurated, the matter has found its way to the firft and only orifice, w'hich has difcharged very confidcrably, and for a long time together, without any interruption ; and when the breaft has got well, only the fmalleft fear imaginable has remained. And it might be here noticed again, that the little jagged aperture which nature has made for herfelf, keeps open much better than one from the lancer, though made four or five times as large : every furgeon ^ knowing

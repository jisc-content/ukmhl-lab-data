4? A TREATISE upojr return, is greatly owing to their having been healed in an horizontal pofition of the limb. Having now conhderecl many, and perhaps the chief of the internal means in general ufe, together with the pofition of the affcdled part, and the diet of the patient, I fhall proceed to make fome obfer- vations on the ordinary topical applications, the more immediate province of furgery. And the firft thing that demands a particular notice, is the long continued ufe of Fomentatiom and Foul- ticesy which, however they may invigorate and warm at the infiant, tend greatly to relax the open mouths of the fine veffels, to defiroy the tone of the mufcular fibres, and induce a flabbinefs of the Ikin over the whole limb;-'^ thus laying an additional foundation for ulcers, healed in this wa)'', to break out again. The ufe of them likewife generally obliges the patient not only to reft, but to keep in his bed,-!- that the limb may be preferved conftantly warm ; for where this Is not attended to, little good can reafonably be expeded, fince a common poultice, foon becoming cold, is likely, in many cafes, to produce more harm than advantage. What has been fald, it ftiould be obferved, relates to their long continued ufe ; an oc- cafional recourfe to them, efpecially In the com- mencement of the cure, and in fome Inftances here- after to be fpecified, may be lometimes, though not very frequently neceflary. * See BrLi..

It requires a knowledge of the fituation of fome few parts, in order to avoid wound- ing them unneceffarily; and this know- ledge, with a little attention, is not diffi- cult to attain. The parts in danger of being wounded, I unneceffarily, in this operation, are, the vafa deferentia ; the vefficulas feminales ; and the procefs of peritonaeum, which ex- tends between the bladder and reftum.

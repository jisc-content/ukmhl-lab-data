^4 INTRODUCTIOK. great lofs of parts; and in the prefent, there Is not ^ lofs of parts proportionate to the immoderate dif- charge. But it is faid by others, that there is not, indeed, fo great a diffolution of folld parts, as to furnifli the xvhole of thefe purulent matters, but fo much of them Is melted down as gives tenacity to the fluid ; and is an eflential ingredient in true pus/>^ Befides what has been already advanced in anfwer to this latter alfertion, it may be obfcrved, that wherever there Is an e\ddent admixture of fat, or of the craffi- mentum of blood, or the parts are in a lax and floughy ftate, the pus is never good, but always thin, difcoloured, or fetid. Whereas, when the furface of an ulcer is firm and florid, without the leaft appear- ance of the melting down of parts, (as it is called) there, it has been obferved, the pus is thick and good; there only is it album, lave et ccquale. Moreover, if the diffolution of organized parts, does not furnifli a very confiderable portion of the j^)urulent difeharge, it can fupply only a very fmal'i part of it, and is rather an accident, in particular inflances, than a neceffary ingredient in true pus. This, I think, may be fufficlently manifcflfrom what has been faid above on the flate of the parts, as they appear in thofe whp die of an atrophy. In confequence of very large incurable abfeeffes, as well as from the foul flate of every fore, and the impurity of the pus. * Boeriiaave, Blr. Pott, &cÂ« ivheiN

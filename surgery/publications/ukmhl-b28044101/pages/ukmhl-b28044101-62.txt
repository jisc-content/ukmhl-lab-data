INTRODUCTION* panics ulceration, -j*-â€”But though ftimuli, In certain habits, and under certain circumftances, may prove detrimental to health, yet in many inftances, we find them excellent remedies. The good effeds of blifters and cauftics, applied near the feats of difeafes, are generally known ; yet we do not fuppofe, that there is any fpecific virtue in cantharides, neither do we regard them as the evacuants of vitiated humors. It is a fact pretty generally admitted, that however plen- tifully a bliftered part may pour out Its ferum, it is often more advantageous to heal the fore, and apply a frefli ftimulant, than to keep it open by mild digef- tives. If the good effeds of blifiers, therefore, be ad- mitted upon thefe principles, why rejed this reafoning in the cafe of ulcers, which may not improperly be termed perpetual blifters or Ifllies ? The efteds of ulcers upon the conftitution in gene- ral, being thus hinted at, the main queftion may be refumed, viz. Is it always proper to attempt the cure of ulcers ? Were a general and dired anfwer to be offered, it might be given In the affirmative. Should a cafe occur (which is not Improbable) where upon the whole. It may be judged a lefs evil to fuffer the ulcer to remain, than to attempt its cure, yet if Its extent of furface be very confiderable, it will be pru- dent to leflen Its dimenfions. To this may be added. -f- Natura cnim, femper folicita eft in confcrvatlone Individui fai, morbifque fefe opponit; fed proutvalida aut imbecillis fuerit, aut vidiix eradit, aut fuccumbif.

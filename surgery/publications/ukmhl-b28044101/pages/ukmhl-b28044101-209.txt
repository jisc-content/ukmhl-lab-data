Of the eye. 27 and lliould this not prevent frequent relapfes, the pa- tient, it has been faid, fhould make trial of the fea; which is more frequently ufeful in fcrophulous ophthalmias than in any other inftance. Something has already been faid in favour of in- vigorating applications, which for the chronical ophthalmia, and that tedious one which fometimes follows the meazles and frnall-pox, as well as in many fcrophulous cafes, ought to be made much more adive than they ufually are, and of which I have had- many happy inftances. But, indeed, many inflam- mations of the eyes, that are apt to return frequently and upon flight occafions, are rather owing to an atony of the parts, than a true inflammatory caufe, and will therefore always be benefited by fuch appli- cations. And thefe fhould be applied in an undtuous form rather than in a W'ay of lotion, and will be found to be a very confiderable improvement. Hence it is, I apprehend, that Sir Hans Shanes lini- ment formerly gained fo much reputation, and has fo often been of fervice; its only virtues, however, confiding in its form and the powder it contains, which affording a flight flimulus to the parts, is rendered more permanent in the form of a liniment, than any fluid collyria can afford. Ointments againft inflammatory affe<ftions ought not ufually, however, to contain fuch kind of powders, w'hich often do harm, and can furnifli no powers that cannot be otherwife obtained, and efpecially by fome preparation of mercury ; which indeed will do more in many ophthalmias than any other kind of reme- M 2 dies.

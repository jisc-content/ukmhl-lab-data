( 1^3 ) curvature of the urethra; for as the cathe- ter muft pafs through the urethra,by forcing the fides of it afunder, it ought to pafs ex- aaiy along the courfe of it, and prefs, equally, in every direBion; but thefe ad- vantages can be obtained, with any degree of certainty, in no other manner, than by making the curvature of the former to correfpond exaftly with that of the latter. If this is not attended to, the point of the inftrument, when it comes to the difeafed part, inftead of preffing againft its centre, preffes principally againft its pofterior part. In common catheters, this defeft may be remedied, in fome meafure, though by no means completely, by deprefting the han- dle ; which throws the point of the inftru- ment forwards. But, ftill, the point does not defcribe the courfe of the urethra; and, without extreme attention, there is great danger of forcing it through its ftdes. Y 2 A catheter

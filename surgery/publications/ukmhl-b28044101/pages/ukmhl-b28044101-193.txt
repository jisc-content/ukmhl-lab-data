Befides every other advantage of this method of difcharging the matter, which will alfo be gradual, is the exclufion of air; a point fcarcely enough at- tended to in the treatment of abfceffes. The feton being introduced, fhould be drawn up and down at leaft twice every day, and fometimes be moiftened with fome proper deterfive ointment; and occalion* ally fprinkled with precipitate. The conflant irri- tation of the feton, will tend to diffolve the remain- ing hardnefs of the glands, far more than any com- mon poultice, w'hich frequently ferves only to de- flroy the fkin without affording that ffimulus to the parts underneath, W'hich this fore always requires. The irritation of the feton wall alfo difpofe the bot- tom of the abfcefs to throw up healthy granulations, the moment the hardnefs is diffolved, and the fore W'ill thereby heal up kindly, more expeditioufl}'â€™, and with much lefs fear, than could be expelled from the extent of the tumor; no more than the marks of the pundlures, and a little rednefs of the fkin, as it was obferved, remaining afterwards to be icen. Should the pundlures made by the feton, however, not be difpoled to heal in a reafonable time, after the filk is withdrawn (which fhould be gradual, by removing a few threads at a time,) and yet no frefh hardnels take place, nor the difeharge be increafed 5 L 2 the

The Skin is eafily fecured in this Pofture, by long Slips of Linen, or Lint, about two Fingers Breadth, fpread with Ce- rate, or any foft cooling Ointment, thefe are to be brought from Side to Side acrofs the •Face of the Stump; then apply over them a little foft Lint, with a Tow Pledget, and comprefs of Linen, the whole to be retained with a light Linen Roller It is the ufual Cuftom, to rajfe the End of the Stump from the Surface of the Bed, with Pillows; which 'appears to me very injudici- ous, when done to the Height commonly pradifed, as it draws the Pofterior Mufcles off the Face of the Stump. I find the bed: Di- redlion is to raife the Stump about half a Hand’s Breadth from the Surface of the Bed. Mr. Z,vo« firll placed the Skin in this Direaion, in an Amputatioi of the Thigh, and dreffed with a dry Linen troh Cloth, applied from Side to Side, next the Face of the ^tump.

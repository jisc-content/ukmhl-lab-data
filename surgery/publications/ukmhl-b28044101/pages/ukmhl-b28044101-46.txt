Since this trad: firft appeared, it has been objeaed to this idea of ulceration, that it is a dodtrine as yet by no means eftablilhed, and although there certainly doth exift in the animal body a power of abforbing its own conftituent parts, yet it cannot be proved that this abforption is always attendant upon ulcera- tion ; nor is there any rcafon that prevents us equally from fuppofing that ulceration may be the effedl of fome external corroding power, the nature of which is unknown to us. Such an obfervation certainly deferves a ferious attention, and I do not know that any thing I have advanced is diredtly inconfiftent with it. I pretend to no great phyfiological knowledge, and never in- tended CO infiftiUpon the extent of the abforption to which I have alluded, or have attempted to prove that it always takes place in ulceration ; I have only * Phyfiology, I believe, is indebted to the ingenious Mr. Hunter for this no lefs probable, than curious idea. •j- See Mr. Cruikshank’s letter on theabforption of calomel, to whom the world is no lefs indebted for his indefatigable atten- tion to, and ufeful difeoveries in the abforbent lyflem. con-

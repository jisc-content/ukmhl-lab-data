71 ULCERS OF THE LEGS. few days, and in this fenfe, a healing of the wound is produced; and it mufl be very great motion indeed to prevent it. Now this is the kind of healing in queftion relative to ulcers on the legs, and if mo- tion of the part affedted is capable of preventing it, (where a proper bandage is conftantly worn) * it muft either be fnch, and to a degree that would prevent, not the union, but the healing of the raw edges of the lip I have mentioned; and furely no common adfion of the lips will do this. Or fecondly, it muft be effedted from the exercife fo greatly increafing the difcharge, as to prevent that difpofition to dry up. * It may not be ufelefs in this place, to make a few general ob- fervations on mufcular adlion, with a view to point out the fource of fome of thofe particular advantages of tight bandage before no- ticed,where exercife is ufed. In mufcular adlion, there is abvays an accurtatiou of the moving fibre, and a general enlarge- ment of the mufcle. This increafe of bulk is not eqvial, but is greater about the belly, than at the extremities of the mufcle.—Dif- eafe in a part may render this adllon liable to great irregu- larities—Fafcia, and annular ligaments, &c. prevent unequal contradlion, and its manifefi inconveniencies.—It is true, we don’t find the mufcles adling in fuch a way, as to prefs from within out- wards, to a degree capable of forcing up the fkin very confiderably;* but they can, neverihelels, pull upwards and downwards, with fuflicient force to derange a healing wound.—Now bandage effec- tually prevents irregular adtion, and will keep the fkin from moving confiderably when the mufcles adl, as well as diminifli the fwell of thofe that lie immediately under it..—Thefe are precifcly the points aimed at; and that bandage will anfwer tbefe intentions, is very evident, both from reafou and experience, f See pages 62, 63.

^5 Of the E Y E. lited cold, are neverthelelefs oftentimes Inftantly bc-^ neficlal upon ufing them aftually warm, efpecially in cold weather. Of the propriety of this change, the fenfations of the patient upon the ufe of cold collyria will frequently be a guide to us; and I have only to remark, that they ought not to be ufed warm for any length of time, in which refpedt however, the intelligence of the patient may again ferve to di- rect us. Amongft the means for removing great inflam- mation, was mentioned the defending the eye from a flrong light, which is indeed indifpenfibly neceflary. This fliould, however, be rarely extended to keeping the patient’s room perfectly dark, or covering the eye itfelf in fuch a way as to exclude all contadt of light as fuch covering, by heating the eye, will always * I hope it may not be deemed altogether impertinent in this place, to offer a few obvious cautions, fcarce fufficiently attended to by thofe whofe eyes are naturally weak, or {lightly diftem- pered. Such people ought to be peculiarly careful not only of not continuing any occalional exercife of the eyes after it becomes painful to them, but as much as pollible, to be always expofed to the fame degree or quantity of light. This attention is particu- larly neceflary when engaged in reading, writing, or other em- ployment that is likely to fatigue them : too little, or too much light being equally improper when the eyes Sre much exercifed ; and is, indeed, at any rime injurious. The fudden tranfitioa from a dark to a very luminous afpe£f, and efpecially if often re- peated through the day, has nearly produced blindnefs in feveral iflftances; and patients have been recovered from the danger by little more than attending to this oircumftance.

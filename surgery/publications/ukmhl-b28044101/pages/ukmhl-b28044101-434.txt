And the reafon why the catheter does not pafs into it, is, that the palTage is become more curved; and the inftrument, inflead of following the di- reftion of the paffage, prefles again!! the projefting part of the prohrate gland. But if the point of the catheter is direfted along the courfe of the urethra, it pafles, in moft cafes, with tolerable eafe ; the great difficulty, then, confifts in finding the courfe of the urethra: to remove this difficulty, the oblervations above laid down muft be attended to ; and, when the furgeon is ac- quainted with the nature of the difeafe, and the general alteration, which has taken place in the ftrufture of the parts, every thing depends, in a great meafure, upon his facility in handling the inftrument; no two cafes being exaftly fimilar. The chance of fuccefs is greater, in proportion, as he handles it with more dexterity.

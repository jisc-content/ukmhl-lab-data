INTRODUCTION. 21 examined a few hours after being dreffed, no fuch matter as pus will appear, but a thin, ill-looking fanies is fpread over the furface.*—Indeed, the for- mation of true pus, and the putrefaftive fermentation of animal fubftances, bear no refemblance to each other, lince pure pus is perfedlly inodorous, whilfl the other emits a volatile alkali. Nor do we find, that matter difcharged from a wound bears any regu- lar propotion either in quantit}', or quality, to the fuppofed degree of fermentation. If we only attend to the diflercnt afpedt of an ulcer, when it produces pus, ichor, or fanies, whether we realbn analogically, or from evident appearances, the idea that has been thrown out, of the healthy or morbid adtion of the vef- fels, as the moll; probable caufe of this difference,"!' appears, by no means, to be an unreafonable conjec- ture. In fupport of this theory, however, I fliali * From hence, a fallacy may be difcerned in the Ingenious the- ory of the late il/r.

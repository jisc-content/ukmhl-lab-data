IN SURGERY. 9? I Van Swieten who has defcribed fthis dil'eafe with his uAial accuracy, is in- clined to think, that the pernicious cuflom I of drinking tea or coffee almod fcalding ihot, may be the caufe of it, by coagulat- ;iingthe fluids, and flirinking up the fblids. ii This opinion is probably true, becaufe w’’0- Jimen are almoft the only fubjedts of the iidifeafe. Indeed, in all the cafes of the ;felkind that I have feen or heard of, the pa- Itients were of that fex. Dr. Munckley -f* has given a hiftory of the cure of this difeafe by mercury ||: ■ in a very candid manner^ he informs us, ;that fuccefs can only be expedled to at- itend its adminidration under certain'’cir- fiicumftances and periods of the difeafe; and £;that, when no nutriment can be conveyed 3 into the ftomach, and the conftitution is 3|much impaired from the want of fufte- ■f nance. See. the patient is equally unable ' to bear either the remedy or the difeafe. • Comment, in Aphor. Boerh. § 797. t Med. Tranfaft. Vol. I. p. 165.

IN SURGERY. The The tunica conjunaiva not being in Sept. 19. any degree unloaded, fix leeches were again applied round the eye j and I intend- ed to have opened the temporal artery, but its pulfation could not be difcovered with fiiflicient precifion, to give that operation any chance of fucceeding. The other di- reaions were obferved as before. The acute pain in the head was dimi- 21. nifhed, but the ftate of the tunica conjunc- tiva was much the fame as before. Hav- ing fomented the eye and temples fome time with warm milk and water, I invert- ed the lower lid, and with the point of a lancet made feven or eight fcarifications in- ' to the tunica conjunftiva. I kept the car- tilage fome time inverted with my finger, to promote the evacuation; and by thefe means two or three tea-fpoonfuls of blood were difchargedthe warm fomentation was ufed again. The patient flept much better this night than uTual; in the fuc- could fee objedls more and the pain of the head was inconfiderable.

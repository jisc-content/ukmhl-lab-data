9S A TREATISE upon precipitate, or by a fmall portion of verdigrcafe ; or we have a very excellent one ready made to cur hands, the unguent, citrinum ; but, however uncom- mon the pradfice, it is fometimes better to ufe the red precipitate alone In the firft ftage of the cure, than to mix it with the digeflive; and this the ulcer will alfo readily bear, when exercife, and a good diet are allowed. And here it is, that the judgment of the furgeon difcovers itfelf, in adapting his dref- lings to the nature of the ulcer, which (laying afide the refinements, and nice diftindtions I have ventured to difcard,) muft by one mean or other, be brought to difcharge laudable pus, whatever appearance its fur- face may have ; for nothing goes on well till this is effedted.

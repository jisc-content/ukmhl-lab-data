This, together with a defire of turning the attention of praftitioners, in general, more towards the mode of re- lieving a fet of difeafes which, the author is forry to fay that he has feen, more than once, prove fatal, from a want of proper attention ; and a defire of removing that prejudice which too generally prevails in the me- dical world againft the operation of punfturing the bladder, has induced him to publifh them. If they fliall be found to fugged ufeful hints to thofe praflitioners, who have not an extenfive praftice in fur- gery, but yet are liable, occafionally, to have the ma- nagement of thefe difeafes, without having an opportu- nity of calling in a more experienced furgeon to their alTiftancc, the intention of the author will, in great meafure, be fulfilled : although, at the fame time, he hopes, fome of the hints contained therein, will not be undcfervlng of attention from the more experienced- furgeon. ‘ Having had frequent opportunities of obferving that much mifehief is often done by the too frequent and improper ufe of catheters, in certain difeafes of the ure- thra, the author has added, in an appendix, fome ob- fervatlons on the ufe of thofe inftruments. Thefe, he hopes, will likewife be found ufeful to fuch praftitio- ners as are not much in the habit of ufing catheters ; as well as to thofe who are profecuting their ftudies in this branch of furgery.

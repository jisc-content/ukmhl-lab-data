APPENDIX. 2'42 The extirpation of the bronchocele by the knife, hath been attempted by Aqua- pendente, and recommended by Dionis. And we read in Palfin that a young la- dy of diftin<fUon having had a broncho- cele extirpated, died under the operation. Mr. Gooch tells us, “ that he was “ once prevailed upon to be prefent at the “ extirpation of a bronchocele. The Sur- geon was an intrepid operator, but be- “ fore he had half finhhed the bufinefs, “ there was fuch an efFulion of blood, as obliged him to defift, and turn his “ whole attention to reflraining the has- ** morrhage j or, in the opinion of all pre- fent, the patient would have funk and ** died under his hands. She died in lefs ** than a week, and I was informed that the blood was never totally flopped. “ In another Cafe, where the operation «* was performed againft my opinion, by « one of the moft dextrous operators in « London, a fatal haemorrhage was very near taking place. 1 he young lady s * Palfin Anatom.

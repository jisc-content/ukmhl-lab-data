INTRODUCTION. pus. An idea, as I conceive, unbecoming a think<i ing mind, as it fuppofes fomething utterly unlike every thing elfe of which we have any probable evi- dence in the animal oeconomy; and which was, indeed, the chief matter 1 intended to controwrt, and muft ftill think, is far lefs probable than that adt of the . ab for bents, conceived of by Mr. Hunter. - § But this idea of ulceration fuggefts a very natural inquiry, viz. from whence comes the purulent mat- ter difeharged by ulcers ? It has been faid, that ul- cers are drains to carry olf peccant humors;* or dif- folved cellular and mufcular fubftance ; -f- we have been told, indeed, that pus exifis in the blood, and is poured forth at thefe outlets.—The laft-mentioned idea is in itfelf fo improbable, and {landing unfup- ported by any decifive proofs, it may be regarded merely as hypothetical.—A few remarks on the for- mer will naturally arrfe in the farther difeuffion of the fubjedf. * “Ulcers may be looked upon as drains which nature has made choice of to relieve herfelf.” Le Dr an, •f “ Pus is a mixture of various ingredients, viz. blood, which has loft its red colour, and is the largeft ingitdient in the mixture; a little vifeid lymphatic juice, and the extremities of the lacerated veflels, which fall off in fmall parcels, and are converted into a foftifh and whitillr kind of glue.’^ Fizez, On Suppuration. “ Si fanguis in ventrem effufus fuerit, pr:eter naturam, necelTe eft ut fuppuratur.

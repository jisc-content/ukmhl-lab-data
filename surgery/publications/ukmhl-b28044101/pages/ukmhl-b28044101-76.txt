45 A TREATISE upon cularizcd in another place, at prefent I fliall confine mylelf to what is judged to be improper, and fhali therefore briefly point out the difadvantages of an error in this rcfpect, A low, and very limited diet, by its effedfs in weakening the conftitution, together with reft and purging, tends to keep up that indif- pofttion to heal, conftantly obferved in thefe fores; and thus confpires W'ith the weaker circulation in the parts, to prevent the formation of good and laudable pus, fo neceflary to the cleanfing and filling up of every old ulcer* Befides, cures effedied under fuch a regimen are very unlikely to ftand, and accord- ingly very rarely continue for any length of time. In many patients, and efpeclally the heedlefs, and often abandoned amongft the poor, who foon return to their old and very different ftyle of living, the yet tender cicatrice is unable to withftand this new im- petus of the fluids, the confequence of which muft be plain and obvious, without adverting to other confiderations. Indeed, too applicable to this and other circumftances of difcipline, in the management of fore legs, is that univerfal maxim, omms fubita immutaUo pericuhfa; for indeed nature is abhorrent from it.-*—In fhort, if the cure of very bad ulcers on the lower extremities is defigned to be lafting, there muft be a greater conformity in the non-naturals. * Neque ex multa fame nimia fatietas; nequeex nimia fatletate fames idonea eft.—Item, neque ex nimio labore fubitum otium, Deque ex nimio otio fubitus labor, fine gravi noxa eft.

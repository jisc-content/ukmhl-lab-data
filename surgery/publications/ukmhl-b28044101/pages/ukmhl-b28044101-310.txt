( 46 ) not approve of the trocars, in common ufe; they are made circular in their dia- meter, and with a triangular point. I think an oval trocar is preferable; as it admits of a lancet-point. In moft cafes where a trocar is ufed, we wifh the wound to be made in fuch a manner as will, as much as polTible, favour its healing by adhefive in- flammation. A fmall wound is more fa- I vorable to heal, than a large one; and a wound, the fides of which have a tendency to to pafs away fo rapidly as before, the bladder is pre- vented expelling it fo quickly with the ordinary force: this proves an additional ftimulus to its mufcular fibres, and they aft with greater force. As the refiftance in- creafes, the ftimulus, and the confequent afction of the bladder, increafes ; and, as the affion increafes, the fize and ftrensth. of the mufcular fibres increafe alfo. O Common obfervation will lliew, that, where a mulcle, or a fet of mufcles, are exerted in an increafed degree, for a length of time, they become gradually larger and ftronger. Thefe exertions prove an additional ftimu- lus to the circulation in them; more blood paffes throâ€™ them, in a given time; and the aftions, for their growth and nourilliment, are carried on more rapidly.

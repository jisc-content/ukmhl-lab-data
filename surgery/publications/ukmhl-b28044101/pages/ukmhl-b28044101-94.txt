A TREATISE upon’ 64 the more fpcedy clofing up of deep ulcers after a proper digeftion; or at the moft, as expulfive, to prevent fluxion to a part; but their bandages were but ill-calculated to anfwer the end, and were never ' applied fo tight as Wlfernan recommended, nor with particular reference to the . legs. J'Fifeman himfelf, however, does not appear to have- underflood all the advantages he received from the life of his laced- ftocking, as he feems apprehenfive that the cure of uleers on the legs obtained by this means, were lefs likely to ftand, than thofe effedted without it. He appears, therefore, frequently to have recommended the flocking and rollers on the fame principle with reft, and an horizontal pofition of the limb, to pre- vent what is termed a defeent of humours to the fore, and the erdematous fwelling that often accompanies thefe ulcers. But his reafoning was certainly not fo good as his pradlice, and had his bandage effedfed no- thing beyond his intentions, his fuccefs had been much lefs than it was. The roller has many other ufes befides counteradling the difpofition to oedema, (to which the lower extremities are peculiarly liable), and one that I muft. beg leave to notice in this place, arifing from the manner in which the filling up of every deep ulcer is efledled. To this end, there is not only a trifling elongation of the capillary vef- fels in the wound, but the parts contiguous to the ulcer are found to wafte, or diminifli confiderably; infomuch that Fabre and Louis* eminent Mcmoircs dc 1’Academic de Chirnrgic^ Fo!. iv. furgeons

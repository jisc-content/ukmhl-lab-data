A TREATISE ttpoit 38 fore legs, and though it may have its ufe as an anodyne, in a few cafes hereafter to be mentioned., it will be fufficlent to obferve here, that it hath, perhaps, done lefs for thefe than for any ulcers, for which it has been at different times recom- mended. The SoLANUM, I believe, has been long exploded, as a remedy not at all to be depended upon, and would not have been mentioned here, if great things had not once been faid of it. It appears, however, to have had its ufe in fome cafes, which I was witnefs to many years ago, when houfe-furgeon to St. George's hofpital, but it is certainly much too powerful and uncertain a remedy for general ufe, and no rule has been found whereby a judgment might be formed of the probability of its fucceeding, unlefs it may be faid in cafes attended with great pain; and herein it is not only far lefs certain than opium, but much inferior to the cicuta. It may, however, be admi- niftered with fafety for a few days, and will often produce a florid furface on an ill-conditioned fore. Nitre was a few years ago recommended in the cure of ulcers;* and having been long regardful of inftrument of prolonging the valuable days of his nearell relative, and choiceft comfort in life. The cicuta hath likewife been fometimes efficacious in difeafes of the moft dangerous nature, and even in that opprobrium to the healing art, the cancer, when feated in the uterus. Of this, the writer may give the public a fuller account in fome future w'ork, if the remedy ffiould con- tinue to be as fuccefsful as he has in feveral inftanccs lately experienced if. * Dr. Rowley, On Ulcers of the Legs% every

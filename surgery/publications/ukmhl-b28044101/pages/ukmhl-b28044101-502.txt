The prefent method of removing a large circular portion of the fcalp, previons to the operation of the trepan, appears to me not only a very unneceflary, but a very in- human praaice. It removes the feat of the hair, expofes a larger quantity of the furface of the bone than is neceflary (ren- dering thereby an expoiiation almoft un- avoidable) confiderably retards the cure of the wound, and when, at laft, the parts are healed after this operation, they will experience the lofs of that defence, which the thick Ikin and aponeurofis of the occi- pito-frontalis mufcle, forming the fcalp, would ofnerwife have yielded to them *. .

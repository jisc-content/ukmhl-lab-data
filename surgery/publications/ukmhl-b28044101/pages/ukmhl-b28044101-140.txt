A TREATISE uW no in ten or twelve days. Should others, however, prove obftinate, from having their feat on more tendinous parts of the leg, the ointment muft be made more aftive by the addition of a little lapis infernalis ; which forms an admirable dreffing for many dyfe- pulotic fores. There are other fmall old ulcers, which often require a peculiar kind of dreffing, merely from their being feated on tendinous or ligamentous furfaces, fuch as the inftep and lower parts of the leg. On this head, I need only to obferve, that common treacle with frefli lemon juice boiled up in it, agrees with them fo well, that they require nothing more, unlefs it be to have the furrounding parts touched W'ith a lotion of the tind:ur. martis cum fpir. falis, fufficiently diluted; both which applications fhould be continued as long as the fores remain in a very irritable Hate. I ffiall juft remark, that the like dreffings agree equally well with many foul ulcers, that are irritated with moft other dreffings. 1 have alfo met with other deep, and painful ulcers, fomewhat larger, of no regular figure, nor confined to any particular parts, for which the fine powder of bark is often a good dreffing. After the ulcer has been filled with this, morning and night for a few days, and covered with a good digeftive, fuch fores will begin to fill up with firm and florid granulations, and will lofe their morbid fenfibility ; but if they fhould not, the furface muft be deftroyed by preci- pitate, as formerly diredled, and trial made again of the bark, if it fhould feem to be neceflary.

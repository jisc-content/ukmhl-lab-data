INTRODUCTION. 17 contended, tlitit the idea of Mr. Hunter (as far as I have adopted it) appears to me truly ingenious, and far preferable to that of parts being melted down into pus; againft which, at leaft, I imagine fome argu- ments are advanced that will not eafily be overturned. It is very probable, indeed, that the animal juices when extravafated, may acquire fuch an acrid quality- in a difeafed part, as may deftroy that cohefion of parts necelTary to their life, and may fo change them that very little of them maybefeen ; though the whole of them may not be taken off by the abforbents. It is certain, that the conflituent parts of animal bodies when reduced to their firft principles, are but fmnll in quantity, and when the body is fo reduced by putrefadlion after death, the quantity of earth and water is but very inconfiderable. But whatever ana- logy to this putrefadlive principle the juices may acquire during life, lb as to be capable of mutilating the parts, it will by no means follow, that they are fo changed as to be turned into pus ; for not only is the diflblution here fpoken of, the effedf of dlfeafe In the juices, but is fuch as muft reduce the parts to their firft principles, at leaft in a confiderable degree, and exifts only in a foul and bad ftate of the fore ; whereas the formation of pus, cfpecially of laudable matter, depends on the healthy ftate of an ulcer, and is ufually an indication of a favourable ilfue. So that, whatever corroding power there may be, wdie- ther Internal or external, it can, by no means, account for the kindly fuppuration of abfcelfes and ulcers, where the parts are fuppofed to be melted dowm into B pus.'

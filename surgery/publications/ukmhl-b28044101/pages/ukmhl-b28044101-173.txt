Thus far fpme experience may be faid to have gone, but how much farther this plan may with fafety and advantage be extended, it is time only can prove. It has been obferved, however, that my ex- perience of its advantages over every other method hitherto made public, has been greatly confirmed fince the former edition of this work ; and I have therefore farther ground for hoping that the treatment .laid down in thefe pages, may be applied to ulcers attended with caries of the bone. At lead, when the ulcer is only of a moderate fize, and the injury has not penetrated fo deeply, or the pain and inflam- mation are fo great, as to render a very long confine- ment abfolutely necelfary, the methods propofed feem topromife fuccefs; though my own experience may not warrant me to promife it where the caries is confider- able.

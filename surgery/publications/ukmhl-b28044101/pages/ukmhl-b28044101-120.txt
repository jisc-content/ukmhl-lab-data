A TREATISE 9© UPON the laft, however, will be lefs proper if the inflam- mation be confiderable ; but the antiphlogiftic regi- men can never be required very long, for if the in- flammation does not prefently yield, there is probably fome other caufe for it than the ulcer, unlefs there be difeafe of the bone. The former, it will be the phyfician’s province to difeover and remove ; but if neither of thefe fhould be the cafe, and yet the in- flammation continue, it will not prove of the phleg- monous kind, and I can venture to fay will yield together with the pain, to fuch topical applications as fliall promote a difeharge, and with the affiflance of firm bandage and exercife, (hall cleanfe or deftroy the too fenfible furface; which will immediately be followed by eafe, and a healthy appearance of the fore. It may be neceffary in this place, to take notice of a fource of pain not mentioned, that I know of, by any writer, and for a clear account of which I am obliged principally to an ingenious correfpondent in the country, fince the firfl edition of this tradf; having myfelf obferved it only once, in any confiderable degree. This is an obfeure oedema, more commonly attending fmall fores, and occafioning very great pain about the little ulcers, or not unfrequently along ihc whole fpine of the tibia, efpecially in the morn- ing; and is effedfually cured by only applying the bandage a little tighter than ufual. It may be met virtues than that of an anodyne, as fome people have been of opinion, the patient will enjoy the advantage of them. ^ With

'ill A TREATISE upon if ulcers are fuffered to heal up before the whole of the furface has been covered with firm granulations, or if after this, they have been dried up with a thick fcab, or fuch be formed afterwards, they will be apt to break out into worfe fores than before. Such fcabs arife either from the furface of the ulcer becoming dry in different parts, in the form of iflands, as they have been called, or from the thickening of the edges of the cicatrice. The former mufl never be allowed of in this clafs of ulcers; but fuch fpurious covering mull: be deftroyed, the bottom of the ulcer, in fuch parts, being unfound; no fore on any other part of the body ever healing in that manner, when defended from the air. In the latter inllance of fcab, when the fore is become fmall, the edges of the new cicatrice are found, from day to day, rifing above the level of the found fkin, as the cicatrice advances on the furface; and certainly indicates a fucceeding fcab. This is therefore to be prevented, efpecially in ulcers of long Handing, or fuch as have difeharged very coploufly, and in patients who have been accufiomed to fore legs. In order to prevent fuch kind of healing, the new edges fliould be well rubbed daily with an armed probe, or be feraped down with the fpatula as long as they lhall appear thick ; and fliould this not be fufficient, they fliould even be deflroyed by lunar cauflic, and the dderfive powers of the dreffings be increafed. This may be done by the unguentum citrinum, or the cerat. epulof. with precipitate, by which ulcers may be healed very kindly, and on the above account, I have obferved this fort of dreffings are

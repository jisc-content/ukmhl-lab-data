CASES AND REMARKS new road for the blood opened, before the old one be rendered impervious. The recommendation of the ufe of pref- fure, as a proper preparative for the opera- tion, muft, however, be received with li- mitation, as there are fome fpecies of the jlpurious aneurifm, where it cannot be fup- pofed to take place. Till within thefe very few years, it was an opinion generally re- ceived amongft furgeons in England, that if the principal arterial trunk of the arm or thigh was tied, the parts below the li- gature muft neceflarily mortify, from an interception of the blood which' (hould nourifti them. Whenever, therefore, an aneurifm had its feat in the crural or hume- ral artery (above the flexure of the elbow joint) nothing but amputation was thought of. Some very eminent furgeons have de- clared their opinion, that whenever the operation for the aneurifm hath fuccceded in the bend of the arm, the artery had di- vided above the part (a variety fometirnes obferved) and a branch only had been in- cluded in the ligature.

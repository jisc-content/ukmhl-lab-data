It will there- fore be fufficient to apply a mild, defenfive plafter. Or fometimes one more drying, (as formerly recom- mended, if there are heats on the fidn) which fiiould be fpread only on a piece of doubled linen, and be laid over the digefiive; but if hard comprefs, or merely drying applications are laid on the fore, the ill-confequences I have mentioned will ge- nerally follow, or the fore, for want of proper di- gefiion, will break out again. Upon the above plan, however, every objediion to healing the ulcer, as well as our fears for its return, are fufficiently obviated, and for want of which, the author of the paper in the Medical Obfervations^ ap- pears to have obferved the above unpleafant effects; for if old ulcers are dried up infiead of digefied, and fkinned over infiead of being cleanfed and incarned * Hippocr A.TES fpeaking of recent ulcers, hints at this expe- ditious method of healing under particular circumilances, but how inapplicable to the cafes before us, reafon and experience will de- termine—“ aut fi quis avertat (viz, fuppurationem) ut omnino non fuppurentur, praeterquam neceflario, eoque paiiciflimo pure, et ficca funt quam maxime, ex medicamento non moleflo,”—though rn another place he adds, “ ulcera non purgata, non committi folenr, etiamfi adducuntur, neque fua fponte coeunr. De Ulca - ihui^ § V.—No better proof, however, need be fought for, that fuch is the general mode of treating ulcers of the legs, than the. candid obfer.yation of the anonymous writer mentioned in the In- troduiftior, page 30.

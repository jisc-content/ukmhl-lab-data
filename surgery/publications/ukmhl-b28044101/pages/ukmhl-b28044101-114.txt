H A TREATISE UPO^T much out of doors, and for obvious reafons more efpecially in winter. However, where thefe ob- jections do not equally take place, every furgeon of experience will judg'e for himfelf, what advantages he may reafonably expeCt from the ufe of it. Befides the cicuta, opium, and other internal re- medies already hinted at, I flaall here mention other three—a ftiong decoCtion of the woods, lime-water, and emetics. The firft will be of fervice chiefly in cafes of obftruCted perfpiration, and cutaneous erup- tions, or the fudden difappearance of them; the lime-water, in the erifipelatous lore, (hereafter to be noticed) efpecially where a great part of the limb is infelfed with a Raiding difeharge, which takes off the fkin wherever it runs. But we fhall be difap- pointed, if we depend on this, or any other internal means; at leafl: I have always found external appli- cations much more effectual—Emetics, may fome- times be ufeful in fome cacochvmic habits, or where there is a cold phleghm on the flomach ; and previous to the exhibition of tonics. Having now'^ attempted, at leafl, to anfwer fome principal objections to the plan I have propofed, and explained what may be expeCted from it, with the manner in which the effeCf is produced, it is high time to proceed to a more particular appli- cation of it.

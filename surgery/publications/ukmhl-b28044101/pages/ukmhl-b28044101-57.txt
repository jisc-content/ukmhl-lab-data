INTRODUCTION. fe*r much lefs to the Quality of the matter difcharged by them ; which it is likely, depend on the ftate and adfion of the veflels of the part, where, at lead, there is no fpecific contagion. No opinion is more popu- lar than the exiftence -of humors in the blood ; and perhaps very few opinions have lefs foundation in faft. The ferum of blood may differ in confiftency, and contain more or lefs faline particles; the red glo- bules may exift in greater or fmaller quantity ; the coagulating lymph may vary in its relative propor- tion to the watery parts of the blood—if we advance much farther, we are treading merely on hypothetical ground. Nor are we warranted to conclude from obfervation, that Quantity ought to inlluence us much more in the healing of ulcers. This has, indeed, been ftrongly afl'erted by many, and is urged by Mr. Bell in the lad edition of his Treatife upon Ulcers ; but it is appre- hended, without any appearance of argument—Let us inquire into the fadt—Are the effedts of ulcers upon the conffitution, by any means, proportionate to the quantity of matter difcharged by them ? Nay, do they not more commonly take place in people of a fpare and thin habit, and thofe of a lax fibre, rather than in the athletic, and fuch as are fubjedt to ple- thora ? And do we not fee, that the fpecies of ulcer, and its feat, very often determine its harmlefs, or mifcheivous tendency ? Whatever may be the habit of body, were we always to form our prognoftic of the termination of ulcers, from the quantity of furface C -

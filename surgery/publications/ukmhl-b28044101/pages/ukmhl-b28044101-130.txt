too A TREATISE upon adive mineral may be applied. It may be laid of this, as Hippoa-ates lays of fritlions, that it foftcns the hard, flrengthens the relaxed fibres, defiroys the unfound, fiimulates and elevates the growing flefh; that it promotes, or diminiflies difcharge, and keeps open, or heals up the ulcer, jufi as you would dire<5t it. Nor is this faying too much of it, with refpe<ft to a great number of cafes, for all this is a very cer- tain confequence of a proper ufe of it, where a tight bandage is applied, and adequate cxercile allowed. Rut then, it has been hinted that, for fome of thefe purpofes, (which will hereafter be fpecified) it mull: be ufed with great freedom, and be often repeated, and infiead of being lightly fprinkled over an ill- conditioned furface, the ulcer mull be filled* with ir, the furgeon taking up a large pinch of it, and plugging up the fore. It has been faid, that the above praftice is parti- cularly ufeful in many fmall ulcers; but even in large fores, fomething of the fame kind will be found ne- cefiary. The foul furface mull be removed, and the fore brought to the ftate of a frelli wound, which can be done only by the diftempered parts being melted * While I was engaged in drawing up this little traft, I chanced to meet with more authority for the above practice than I expedlcd, for looking over Wisemam, I found him making ufe of the very expreffion'^ to which pradice, I am fatisfied, he, as well as Dr. Tur*ner, owed much of their fuccefs. The former tdls us be performed cures on the legs in as few weeks, as the patients had been years under the hands of thofe he calls the barber chirurgcons of the time. Book, /V. cb. 9. ( down

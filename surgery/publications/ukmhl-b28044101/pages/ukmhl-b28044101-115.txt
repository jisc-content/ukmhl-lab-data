ULCER-S OF THE LEGS. S5 m'gbt have appeared, with much more propriety, in a former part of the work, but it feemed of impor- tance to be fully underflood as I went on, and to obviate, as they occurred, the difficulties of an at- tempt to introduce 'fo confiderable an innovation in pradice. On this account, I have preferred this defultory mode to a more concife and formal method ; but fhould I fo far fucceed, as to point out 1 pradlice which others can with fafety adopt, and furnifli the ingenious with hints that may be depended upon, it is hoped, that fome, or even many defedls in other thin<rs will be overlooked. o The numerous claffes of ulcers, of which writers have treated in fo many diflinft chapters, feem more calculated to difplay the Ingenuity of authors, than to lead to any ufeful diferimination ; and mufl therefore tend to perplex thofe whom they ought to inftrudt. Such diftindilons are taken chiefly from certain ac- cidental appearances of the fore, and the nature of the difeharge; but are mod of them fo made as to have very little relation to pradlice, when applied to ulcers on the legs.

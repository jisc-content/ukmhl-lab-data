ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 117 It may then be laid down as a general maxim,, that they lliould rather be fuffercd, than invited to Ikin over; and to fpeak plainly^ I would, efpecially in thole of long {landing, rather irritate ihan coax them, for I know they will heal in the end. And I wifh to enforce this idea very ilrongly, as of the greatefl importance,* and to recommend, in all fufpicious cafes, and efpecially where ulcers have been difpofed to return, the long continued ufe of detcrfive applications, not only till the fores have long put on a very florid and healthy appearance, but almoft, or intirely to heal the ulcer under the ufe of fuch adlive applications; nor will even time always be loll in fo doing. For if every part is be- come perfedlly found, the bandage will furnifh that warmth which Inclines them to heal ; whilfl on the other hand, if nature be not yet difpofed entirely to fupprefs the difeharge, the furgeon, as hath been fiiewn, by attempting to heal up the fore, will have the leg be drelTed with a little white cerate, or any other bland ointment, fpread upon lint, and afterwards with the like fpread on a thin piece of fpnnge, and the part be fo rolled upas to confine the difeharge : or IhouUl the cerate be thought capable of com- municating this property, the difl'erent appearances of the fore will be fiill more evident when drelled one day only with dry lint, and another with fpongc. In a certain flate of the fore, when dif- charging plentifully, the ulcer will be either foul or taw, and its dimenfiorts Increafed, under the former, but will appear frelh, healthy and granulating, by means of ibc acrid difeharge being more abforbed by the latter. * Vide page 28, of the Introduction.

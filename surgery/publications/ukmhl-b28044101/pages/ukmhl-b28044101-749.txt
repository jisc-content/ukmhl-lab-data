- [ ] ne^iing Medium, which in a State of Health, (that is Immediately after the Operation,) is capable of confiderable Elongatim, is now fo altered, by the Inflammation it has under- gone, the Suppuration, and confequent Dif- folution of its Texture, to which may be add- ed, the new formed Adhefions, to which all membranous Parts in an inflammatory State are peculiarly liable, that it is deprived of its yielding Power. As a Proof of this, attempt to draw the Skin forwards, after the inflammatory Stage, and you will find the cellular Membrane fcarcely yield at all, and this more particularly near the Extremity of the Stump, where the Inflammation has been the moft confiderable; hence at this Part, during your x^ttempt, the Edge of the Skin tucks in upon the Surface of the Wound, and the cellular Membrane will give Way only gradually, by being firmly retained in this Poflure, with the Afiifliance of a firm circular Bandage. Therefore the Surgeon will be much difappointed, if he expedls to bring the Skin forwards in any confiderable Degree, by applying his Bandage at this Period ;

A TREATISE upojt 66 drefiings and alterative medicines, have been pre- fently healed upon the application of a very tight bandage; for which information, when I firft began bufinefs, as well as many acfts of kindnefs, I am in- debted to that gentleman, to whom the public well knows its obligations in matters of greater impor- tance.

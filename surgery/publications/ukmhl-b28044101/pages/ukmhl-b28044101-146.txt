A TREATISE upon cerate is ailowed of with the view I have mentioned^ the ufe of drying applications will, by no means, halhen the cure in this clafs of ulcers, which, perhaps, contains much the greatefl number. It away matter, under the idea of keeping the parts clean, is in every cafe abfurd.” See his Treatifc on the Venereal Difafe, page 36, Note. It is fomewhat unpleafant to have to combat fentiments with fo refpcdlable an opponent, whofc experience as a furgeon, as well as his phyfiological attainments, might well claim a reverence from the moil eminent praditioners. But the dotStrine contained in the above extratfl feems to be far too general^ and I think may lead to erroneous pradlice; for an enemy as I am toa fcrupulous attention, and rude manner of always wiping oft'all the difeharge that may be furnilhedby ulcers, I am equally perfuaded, that much matter con- fined upon them will often occafion their fpreading.—It is very pleafing, indeed, to be able to account for the changes taking place in difeafes, and for the operation of certain remedies, as \ve are thereby often enabled to extend the application of the latter to different complaints, and render them more generally ufeful; but we may be too nice in our inquiries, and a turn for theory, and phyfiological difquifitions, may poffibly be carried top far; and certainly are fo, when not only unfup|X)rted, but con- tradidfed by fafts ; as appears to be the cafe in the prefent infiance. For though it is very probable, that the fyfiem may not be affedfed by the abforption of new ve'nereal matter, any more than inoculated patients arc by a frefli application of the variolous; there are ne- verthclefs other ulcers that will fuft'er by the acrid matters which they fometimes fecrete. The difeharge furnifhed by a cancerous fore, it is well known, will erode the fldn, and extend thedimen- fions of the ulcer when not otherwife in a fpreading or fphacelating ftate ; and the like will happen to many other fores when there is no admixture of foreign matters. To prove this, let an ulcer on

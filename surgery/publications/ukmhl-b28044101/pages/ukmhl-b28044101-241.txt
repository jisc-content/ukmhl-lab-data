If the num- ber therefore may be in the lead diminiflied, by the fpeedy cure of fore nipples, fuch a remedy muft be acceptable, in a double refped:, to gentlemen en- gaged in the department of midzvifery.-â€”Perhaps, furgeons in general may be glad to hear, that the aftringent folution is very ufeful in other fiftulous fores than thofejuft mentioned, and is alfo an ex- cellent application to expedite the healing of large burns, as well as fome troublefome venereal ulcers. And I am yet in hopes, when it fliall come into hofpital ufe, (which I do not know it ever has,) it may be found very ferviceable from its friendly af- tringency, in many cafes which I fhall not yet take upon me to fpeak of.

STRICTURES 75 and mitigating the pain ; after which, tonics external and internal, Ihould be employed. By this means it is, I apprehend, that the ferment- ing poultice * has been found of late years fo very ferviceable, and is a grand acquifition in furgery ; but is too little known, by appearing only in a work not generally read by young furgeons. Its effeds have been aftonifliing, and perhaps are aflifled by wrapping up the parts above the gangrene in com- prelles wrung out of fpirits, and renewed as they become dry. It may not operate, however, alto- gether in the w'ay Afr. Power has conceived, nor yet by creating heat, as others have fuppofed, but as much from its being a fedative, and applied in a cold ftate, as from any fpecilic quality of its con- tents ; and therefore derives not its chief virtues from its abforbing, or corredling the acrimonious juices contained in fphacelated parts, if k fhould be allowed to have any tendency that way. However this may be, I believe it has effeded cures, where feemingly from a bad habit o-f body, gangrenes have been in a fpreading ftate for a long time together. In regard to fcarifications, I believe it may be faid, that if we only cut through the efehar, and do not penetrate the found parts, they will foraetimes * This may be made of flour,, honey, and water, mixed up wills veafl, and fpread into a thin pafte, i,ind fet near the fire till it fliall bc^’in to ferment; and in that flate fliould be laid on the part, once or twice a day, if the pain be very great.

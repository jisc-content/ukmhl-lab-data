S6 A TREATISE upon able to make, will be to confider them under two heads onlj^, which are calculated to illuftrate the pre- ceding obfervations, and correfpond with the more clTential points of difference in the treatment they will require. The firft Clafs will include ulcers attended with great enlargement, or hardnefs of the limb; recent ulcers originating from an abfcefs, or any internal complaint; and every very old ulcer of a moderate hze, efpecially in habits accuflomed to them.

In fpeaking of each of thefe, it will be neceffary to make fuch enlargements and fubdivifions, as may relate to praftical ufe. And firft, it will be proper to obferve, there arc two general affeftions, or fymptoms, every ulcer is liable to, which will require their particular treat- ment. Thefe are inflammation and pain; for each of which k will be neceffary to lay down forne general rules. With refpedf to inflammation, fhould this attend a large fore, where the pain is very confiderable, (for the pain fo common in very fmall ulcers, is fddom the confequence of much inflammation, but rather of a thin and cauftic difcharge ;) an emollient fomen- tation

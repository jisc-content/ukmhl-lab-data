*5^ A TREATISE UPON known their art, and have contented ourfelves with fuppofing it to be unfafe, and difpijting the propriety of a cure we have not been able to effed;!—Hie labor^ hoc opus ejl ! This I would ftir up my brethren to attempt, and am perfuaded they may fucceed oftener than it is imagin- ed ; and perhaps the moft rational means is to remove the local afFedion, a relaxed, and therefore irritable flate of the parts. That this has been frequently the great obflacle to their cure, it were eafy to prove by a variety of obfervations taken from healing fores, and from fuch as having promifed w'ell fora while, and then looking pale for a few days, have run into a gangrene; or at lead have continued at a Hand—but I am fatisfied, every experienced furgeon is before hand with me, and is inclined, at lead:, to fuppofe it probable, that the hint may be juft. It is not defigned, however, to dry up ulcers on the legs, as one w'ould a fcratch on the finger; the veflels of the part are firft to be freed, and the ulcer pro- perly digefted, and deterged; efcharotics are to be applied if found neceftTary, and the fore to be treat- ed as diredted in the former part of this w'ork, fo long as nature is difpofed to be aftive; but the moment fhe flags, or cannot be rouzed to a falutary exertion, by ftimulating applications and exercife, (or whenever fuch applications offend,) the inference is as obvious, as an attention to it never fails to be ufeful.

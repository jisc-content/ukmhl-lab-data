MAMMARY-ABSCESS. 53 here, on the many unfavorable circumftances at- tending fuch a pradtice, and the tedioufnefs of the cure as the inevitable confequence. I mean only to hint at a method every way preferable to fo painful a procefs. But not only are the larger in- cilions highly improper, which are made with the knife, but fmaller openings with a lancet arc gene- rally better let alone ; not only becaufe commonly needlefs, and very diftreffing to the patient, but the bread: will heal fooner when the abfcefs is left to burft of itfelf. Hereby, we are fure the fuppuration will become as compleat as the cafe will admit of, and the little jagged round aperture nature makes for herfelf, will keep open much better than the fmooth pundture from a lancet. All that is com- monly neceflary, is to cover the part with a foft bread and milk poultice; to keep it well fupported by an eafy bandage ; and carefully to prefs out the matter, and renew the poultice twice or three times a day. I cannot avoid taking notice in this place, that whilft in one Review this pradfice is faid to have been long underftood, and even publilhed to the world, (thougli I muft dill _confefs, that I never happened to meet with it,) a critique appeared in the Englijh Review of a very different caft. To the Editor of this (as well as thofe of the Monthly and Critical Reviews) I, indeed, feel myfelf much indebted for a very refpcdtful and candid account of the former edition of this work. Objedtions, however, arc made to leaving milky abfceffes to burd of them- felves.

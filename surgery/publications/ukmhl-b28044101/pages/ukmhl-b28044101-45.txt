Simple divi- fion of a living fibre does not necelTarily produce the death of that fibre; but decompofition, either by the putrefactive fermentation, or by art, never can take place without depriving the aflfedted part of its life. Moreover, as the purulent matters difeharged by ul- cers, differ in their chemical properties from dead animal fibres in a ftate of dilfolution, we are certainly not authorized to conclude, that there is a fimilar af-^ rangement of particles. Befides, we ought to find the moil profufe difeharge from an ulcer during the ex- foliation of its floughycovering; whereas the reverfe of this is really the cafe : an ulcer never pouring out fo large a quantity of good matter, as during a few of the firfl days after its furface hasbecome clean. And every pradtitioner mufl; recolledt having feen cafes, where the dimenfions of an ulcer have been Increafed to twice its fize, in the fpace of a few hours, without fuch a proportionate increafe of the difeharge, as we ought to expedt under the idea of dilfolution. The procefs of ulceration feems to be a certain adt of the abforbent fyftem, whereby in confequence of a ftimulus, it takes up the foft parts, and carries them irmy venture to affirm, that the diflblution of fome of the folidpar- ticles of broken capillary veffiels, and a mixture of Ibme part of the juices that ffiould circulate through them, makes a neceflary part of the produdlion.

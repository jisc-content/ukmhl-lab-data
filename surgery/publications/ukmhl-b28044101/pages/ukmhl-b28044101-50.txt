ao INTRODUCTION; crcted in the form under which it appears, but it i3 probable, that when it covers the furface of a wound, under the appearance of an adhefive glairy fluid, the' only diftercnce between this and white pus confifls in the c^uantity of fuperfluous water ; when, by remain- ing for fome time upon the part, the thinner fluid is abforbed, or exhaled, the remaining part alfumcs opacity, and acquires a thicker confidence; * for if wounds, furnidiing a great quantity of good pus, are paifiAilar purpofes. The mucous membrane, which lines every cavity expofed to the action of external air, fecretes a fluid called mucus, for the defence of that part, See.—This, in a healthy ilate, is mild and inodorous, and much refembles the white of an egg, being perteidly infipid ; and confequently, can be little more than a mucilasie and water. Whereas ferum cantains neutral fairs in abundance ; fuch mucus therefore cannot be efFufed ferum. If It were merely ferum, it would be more irritating as its confiflency increafed, the reverfe of which is the cafe. When morbid fecre- tion takes place, as in catarrh, gonorrhoea, &c. the eftedts of the neutral fairs in the ferum poured out, are pretty evident. Now, thefe difeafes cannot increafe the quantity of faline matter, confe- quently, we mull feek for the caufe of this acrimony in the dif- ferent addon of tVie veflels.—Thefe varioufly excited, by external or internal flimull, to irregularities in their adfion, maj likewiie ailill: us in our inquiries after the caufe of the various appearances and qualities of pus, and of the difference between that and fuch morbid focretions from an inflamed furface, as affume a piuulent appearance.—With regard to the latter diflindfion, it may be wor- thy the confideration of phyflologifls, how far \.hcJimpJe injiavt malion of a furface, may poflibly be inadeqtiarc to the produamn of true pus; and whether an ernjion, or lofs of ful>Jl<^ncc^ may not be cfl'ential to that particular fecretion. * Sir JcHf; ranici.E. {Jp/entUx,} examined

Upon GANGRENE. matory difpofition has been brought down by the length of the difeafe, rather than to the propriety of the means that have been made ufe of. On the other hand, I have feen a rapidly fpread- ing gangrene, even in advanced years, where bark has been adminiftered freely without any good ef- fect, immediately checked, upon taking away twelve or fourteen ounces of highly inflamed and lizy blood, unloading the bowels, and inflead of cordials and wine, refrefliing the heated patient with faline draughts, and afterwards quieting with opium. So alfo in the fpurious inflammation dependent on ir- ritation, I have known opium keep off a difpofition to gangrene in the toes, even for years, where the difcolouration and pain have conftantly returned foon after the opium has been laid afide; although the patient has died at lafl: of a gangrene of the extre- mities, at an advanced age of life. By whatever means, however, the gangrene may be flopped, there are but few cafes, I believe, where the bark, cordial medicines and wine, will not be found proper at fome period of the difeafe. Should the gangrene take place from atony, general or local, the one or all of thefe will be proper from the begin- ning, and the patient mufl; be fupported by a generous diet throughout the cure. Should they fail in cafes evidently of this clafs, the vitriol, cterul. Ihould be given inflead of the bark, beginning with very fmall dofes, fuch as an eighth of a grain, or lefs, four or fix times a day, diffolved in a fpoonful of fpirituous cinnamon water: a medicine excellently adapted to gangrenes

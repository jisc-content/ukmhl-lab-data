<5 CASES AND REMARKS In the operation of bleeding, the fore-: arm may be faid to be ftrangulated by the ligature; and if, to facilitate the evacua- tion, the furgeon immerfes his patient’s arm in warm water, the veins and the parts below the bandage immediately fwell. It would be abfurd to offer any more arguments in fupport of a. propofition, which in its own nature appears to be felf- evident. For fome years paft, whenever I have been called to a ftrangulated rup- ture, I have made it my firft bufinefs to endeavour to leffen the bulk of the tumour by co/J, and fometimes aftringent applica- tions : and the fuccefs I have met with from this mode of treatment, is my prin- cipal inducement for communicating it to the public. the inteftine within the hernial fac amazingly diftended with air. The Doftor concludes the account with thefe remarks : “ This unhappy cafe gave me a fevere reflec- “ tion ; and I cannot but think the malady was much “ increafed by the repeated application of the hot fomen- , “ tations, as it rarefied the air greatly, and, by relaxing the parts, gave further room to the vail expanfion.” Philofoph.

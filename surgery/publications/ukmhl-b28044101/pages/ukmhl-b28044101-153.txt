ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 125 are in many cafes, preferable to a weakened digelHve, in the laft ftage of the cure. Only large fores will afford any difficulty ; what- ever pain, fwelling, or humors, fo called, attend fmaller ulcers (of this clafs), they will occafion very little trouble, after a little experience of this method of treatment. The eopious difeharge, which a proper diet, exercife, and the digeftives always produce, remove thefe, and many other fymptoms, that are found fo troublefome on every other plan; and fooii •bringing the fore into a healing ftate, ufually no farther difficulties occur, if the bottom be found. If therefore, after this period, a large ulcer is found indifpofed to heal up, (though there be no other reafon for fufpedting mifchief at the bottom) and the ufual flimulants are found ineffedtual, the fore after the ufe of them, ftill continuing at a fland; fomething farther is neceffary : the powers of nature being, in fome habits of body, often infufficient to cover a large fur- face with new fkin, without other affiftance, and a very different ftimulus, which will prefently be de- fcribed.’* This brings me to the Second Clafs of ulcers, which in feveral refpedts, requires a treatment dif- ferent from the preceding.

ULCERS OF THE LEGS., 137 a pretty fare fign we have not miftaken the cafe, and that the means we are ufing cannot be wrong. But if this be attempted too foon, the plan is per- fectly irrational, and the cure will not be accomplifh- ed, or cannot be expected to continue. For this reafon I have objected to the early ufc of thofe drying applications, which fome empirics have entirely de- pended on , as well as againft dreffing ulcers with aq. vegitab. miner, dry lint, and covering the furfacc with lead ; which I may venture* to fay, would, at Icaft, be ufed with more fafety and fuccefs at a later period, when fores are well cleanfed, and nature flags under fruitlefs efforts to cover a large furface fhe can- not firft fufficiently contrail.

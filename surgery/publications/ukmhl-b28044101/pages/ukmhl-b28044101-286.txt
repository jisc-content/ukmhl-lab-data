C 22 ) The the part where the peritonaeum is refleQed, is not quite two inches from the proftrate gland. If we fuppofe a triangle, the fides of which are, each of them, one inch and an half long, and the bafe one inch and a quarter, its area, when inverted, will near- ly correfpond with the area of this portion of the bladder. The proftrate gland is conne6ied to the cervix of the bladder. It is of a fome- what flattened conical figure, and rather more than an inch in length. Its bafis is towards the bladder; its apex towards the ' membranous part of the urethra. It lies upon the inferior part of the reftum, a little above the fphinfter ani, as that intef- tine extends backwards towards the os coc-â€˜ cygis. The proftrate gland may be felt by paffing a finger into the reftum; and the vala deferentia may, without much diffi- culty, be felt above it.

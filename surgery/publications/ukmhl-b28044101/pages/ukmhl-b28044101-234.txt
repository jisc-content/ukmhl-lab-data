52r TREATMENT of the the matter can be felt, and may then be changed for one of mere bread and milk ; the part fliould alfo be fomented twice a day^ if the abfcefs threatens to be large, and docs not incline to ripen fall:, after there are evident tokens of fuppuration. The circumHance of early maturation is of the greateft importance, for in proportion to the length of time taken up in that j:)rocers, will be the fize of the abfcefs, and the time afterwards necelfary for its cure ; at leaft, this is pretty uniformly the cafe. Of no lefs importance is the manner of treating abfeeffes after the matter is well formed. And here I am conftrained to oppofe the antient and common method of furgeons, that of making a large opening with the knife; which can feldom, or never be necef- fary. This happy idea originated from the late in- genious Dr. Hunter, (to whofe unremitted labors in the improvement of his profeffion, as well as in many other inftanccs, the public is lb eminently indebted ;) and I believe, that gentlemen in the department of tsi' midwifery, at lead in London, are well acquainted with the many advantages of fparing women this painful operation : but as it has not been noticed by furgical writers, nor, I think, fufficiently approved of by the generality of the profeffion, there are pro- bably many pradtitioners who are not duly acquainted' with it. The impropriety of making large openings in the bread, arifes, I apprehend, from its glandular llruc- ture, and peculiar ufe, together w'ith the harmlcfs nature of the coaqdaint. But I ffiall not enlarge here.

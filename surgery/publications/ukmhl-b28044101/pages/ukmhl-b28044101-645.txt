In their converfa- tion with each other, they aflc what ope- rations have been done, what to be ieen. who performs them with the greateft ex- pedition ? &c. Is it then improbable that fucb an one, frelh from the fchool of St. Bartholomew, when he is called upon to give his afliftance in a compound fradure, attended with extenfive comminution of the bones, and laceration of the mufcles; where the external wound is large, and hor- rible to the fight i under fuch circumftances, perhaps wilhing to operate, encouraged by Mr. Pott's opinion and diredion: is it, I fay, at all improbable that he will con- demn the limb to immediate amputation ? After engagements at fea and upon land, where compound fradtures are ex- tremely frequent, have the furgeons of the i\mo^ cnlyobjea, which they who come hither” (Lon- don) “ from the diftant countries, have in view.” Mr. Pott’s preface to his Obfervations on the Fiftula Lacry- malis. ■ army

S3 Or THE EYE. Jow as to prevent a blear figbt of the eye. The pait Ihould at firft be conftantly wetted with coding col- Jyria, to which afterwards a little brandy and vitriol may be added, and a drop or two of laudanum be inftilled into the eye, and every thing be attempted that may prevent or diminifh fuppuration; which I have known take place in a very few hours. Should thefe means fail, or what very often hap- pens, affiftance be called in too late, the lids mufl: be frequently drawn afunder to let out the matter, by- right as w'ell as by day; and in the cafe of infants, in whom the matter will be more confined, the edges of the eye-lids Ihould be frequently greazed through- out the day, and at night be covered with a little of ■Goulard's fpread upon very thin linen, and over that a light comprefs, hanging ioofely over the eyes, dipped in the vegito-mineral-water and brandy, or fpread with a kind of liniment made by beating up alum in the white of an egg. Should the inflam- mation and difeharge ftill increafe, a drop of laud- anum, or of a folution of the green vitriol calcined to whitenefs, fliould be inftilled into the eye, at leafl: once a day; which, whatever pain it may occafion at the time, will counteradt the inflammation more than any of the topical applications at a certain period of the difeafe, unlefs it be fome one of the mercurial liniments before recommended.'^ In ♦ In Mr, Ware’s Treatife on Ophthalmia, flrong cortimencla- lion is givtn to Bates's aqua mitriolica camphorata, diluted with about fixtecn tinlts its quamiry of water, as a collyrium, to be made

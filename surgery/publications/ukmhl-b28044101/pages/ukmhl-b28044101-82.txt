I can A TREATISE UPON able, that very irritating applications to thefe ulcers fcarce ever induce it, cfpecially, (however incredible it may appear) where exercife is freely allowed ; which by its tendency to promote the difeharge, fo far counteracts Inflammation. The preclle form of fuch digeflives, it would be thought trifling to inflft upon, as the Pharmacopocite oihondon zy\{\Edinburgh for the moft part contain them, or fuch as are very fimilar to them ; * though both pharmacopoeias are deficient, in regard to a fuitablc digeflive for tendinous parts. In other rcfpects, how- ever, Ibrne one of the more aCtive among thefe preÂ« feribed formulae, will in a very fevv days produce a fine furface on an old, and very painful fore, and with the afliflance of exercife, a good diet, and pro- per roller, will in a variety of cafes, and without any other means, cfleCt a fpeedy and lafling cure; though the patient fhould have been fubjeCt to fore legs for a number of years, and never eafy a month together, after having been repeatedly healed in the ordinary vvay. * It may be ufeful, however, juft to fay, that the Unguent. Bafil, nigr. of the London Pharmacop. as a digeflive for ulcers on the legs, is as inoch preferable to the Bafil. flav. as that would be to the Unij. album. >And I mention this, and have alfo, in the prefent edition, taken notice of other applications I have found ufeful, in confequence of being informed, that gentlemen who have adopted the plan, and with very good fuccefs, have been at great pains in making experiments in regard to topicals, before they could be fatisfied what might belt correfpond with the hints I had formerly given.

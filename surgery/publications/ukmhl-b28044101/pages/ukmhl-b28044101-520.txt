CASES AND remarks 64 ^The 'HISTORY of an uneommon TUMOUR, which thruft the Globe of the right Eye entirely out of the Socket. j CaseXIV.TN the year 1774, M. Watts, aged ''*■ thirty, interfering between two men who were fighting, had a blow from one of them, by which (lie was knocked down. "About a'week after this, fhe perceived a fmall fwelling on the part where fhe re- ceived the blow.’ It was not very trouble- fome to her, and therefore fhe ‘negledted it. As I was paffing her houfe one day, fhe called me in to examine it. I DISCOVERED a tumouT, about the fize of a hazel nut, upon the upper part of the nofe, rather inclining to the right fide. Its bafis adhered to the os nafi, very near, and a little above that part, where the ten* don of the orbicularis mufcle is inferted, and it was fo fixed, hard, and immove- able, that I imagined it to have been an cxoftofis.

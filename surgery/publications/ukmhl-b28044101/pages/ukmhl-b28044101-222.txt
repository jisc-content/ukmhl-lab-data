4® D I. BORDERS determined upon, and the day for It was to be fixed as I llioiild fettle with SirC^sar Hawkins. In this interval, I met with an accident by a fall, which confined me for three or four weeks to the houfe, and I requefted Sir C.’esar Hawkins to per- form the operation for me, if itfhouldbe thought that waiting for my getting abroad might be hazardous to the patient. After making Mrs. Hoppey a vifit with a view to fettling this matter. Sir Caesar Hawkins cal- led upon me, and propofed deferring the operation a few days; adding, that he conceived the eye had rather a better appearance, and though he, perhaps, rather hopedy than was Jlitisfird of this particular, he thought it might be trufied for a few days, with the cautions and diredlions he had given the patient. In about a week after this he acquainted me, that he wilhed the operation might be poftponed a while longer, as the tumour was certainly not increafed. If it were not diminiftied, and of which I fiiould be a better judge, as I had not feen it for fome time. As foon as I could get abroad I w'aited upon Mrs. Hoppeyy and was fatisfied the eye w'as not more en- larged, nor projedlcd, than it had been, and I thought the pulfation w'as diminlfhed; the pain like- wife being lefs, and time having encouraged our pa- tient as well as ourfelves, to hope there might be Jefs danger of a fudden rupture than we had once apprehended, all thought of extirpation was loon afterwards laid afide, unlefs fome new fymptoru Ibould indicate Its necellity. Diiring this fufpence Uie pain became very Incon«». fiderable.

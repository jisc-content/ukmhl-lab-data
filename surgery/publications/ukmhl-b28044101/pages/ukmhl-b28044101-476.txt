20 CASES AND REMARKS That I If the cafe has been mifmanaged, or the patient obliged to ufe exercife, 6cc* the inflammation is communicated to the fkin of the fcrotum, and fuppuration is either threatened, or does, in fome in- flances, adlually take place. That this event fhould ever happen, appears to be more the confequence of fome error in the external treatment of the difeafe, than from any natural tendency, which this particular inflammation has to fuppurate. There can be very few exceptions to the defire, that all Surgeons have to cure al- mofl: every fpecies of inflammation by dif- perflon ; but in the cafe we are now fpeak- ing of, there are many very material rea- fons, why fuppuration fliould be guarded againfl, as much as poflible. After having gone through all the pain and fatigue, which necelTarily accom- pany that degree of inflammation which precedes fuppuration, the patient muft ' fuffer a long time the difagreeable dif- charge from a painful fore, which may at lafl become fidulous.

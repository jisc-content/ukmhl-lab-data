INTRODUCTION. § The nature of the ulcerative procefs next de- ferves our confideration. When from fome caufe, ex- ternal or internal, ulceration takes place, a very ufual way of accounting for this folution of continuity has been, that there is a melting down of the foft parts into pus, fanies, &c.’^’ Experiments on dead and living fubjedts have been made to prove this; yet it is ap- prehended, this procefs never takes place in the living body ; it is a procefs that contradidts every thing we know of the animal oeconomy, and the obfervations of the moft accurate phyfiologifts.

Upon the fame principle, I apprehend, it has been found fuccefsful in many cutaneous difeafes, improperly aferibed to acrimony, and other obfeure qualities prevailing in the fyflem, which are rather owing to a diminiflied vital energy, or to ^ mor- bid a£tion, in the parr. * “ Vafcula diflenta riipta cum dolore, calore, pulfu, liquores fuos effundunt, folvunt, puuefaciunt leviter, folida tenera atterunr, folvunt, fluidis mlfcent in unum fimilem album, fplflum, glutino* fum, pinguem humorem, pus didtum.” Boer.

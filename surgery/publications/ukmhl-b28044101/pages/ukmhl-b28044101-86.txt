5^ A TREATISE upon flammatlon* attends, in which they prove more fpeedily ufeful than any other applications. I might particularly inflance the fmall ulcers on the gums, and infide of the lips, faid to arife from an affection of the ftomach, which are generally cured in a few days, by a little burnt allum, a flight touch with the lunar cauftic, or a drop of fpirit of fea-falt. Whereas, holding warm milk, or any other lenitive, for a much longer time in the mouth, and frequently repeated, though foft and pleafant to their tender fur- face, offended even with the ftroke of the tongue, would have little or no tendency to heal them. So alfo the true feurvy on thefe parts, will bear, by de- grees, the undiluted fpirit of fait,''!'' and is cured by it, when bland applications would increafe the complaint. It is alfo well known, that fome fmall ulcers upon other parts of the body, (and even affetflions of the eye-lids) which are apt to furnifli * I have made ufe of this term from a conviftion, that there are frequent appearances of inflammation, as to colour and heat, where the adlion of the parts affedted is very diifimular to that always met with in true inflammation. Of this fpurious kind may be ranked Eiyfipelar, the treatment of which, it is well known, ought to be materially ciifl'ercnt from that of the true phlegmon—But the fubjedt is not proper for farther difcullion in this place, and would lead me too far; though it may be necefliiry the reader fliould keep the diflind'tion in view, in regard to various paflages, as well tts the pjadHcc frequently inculcated, in the following pages. •| See Van Swieten’s Comment, on Boerhaave, and Lind, On the Seuny.

132 A TREATISE UPON the cffeds of his fuppurative poultice, but It will certainly prove Infufficient when there are large fungi, or of very long Handing. The difeafe often runs too deep, with too hard a callus, to allow the parts to get unloaded, and however fuppurative the poul- tice, it Is not adlive enough to anfwer the end. The hardened parts, however, mull: be removed ; and It may be proper in this place, to hint at a method of treating them that is often preferable, becaufe much lefs fevere, than the cautery, or total excifion with the knife. It is true, a fungus but rarely occurs, fo as to prove troublefome, under the plan I have men- tioned, and which both the bandage and exercife have an uniform tendency to prevent; yet It fome- times happens that a large and hard fungus Is formed ready to our hand, and- is generally the confequence of a bad bottom to the fore. If this arlfes from a narrow neck, It may often be removed by preffing fome fine lint pretty firmly round its bafe; or if this fail, a tight ligature may be cafily paflTed round it. But if the bafis be large, and it lliould not feem dif- pofed to yield to digeftives and bandage (which the fofter fungus generally will, as the bottom of the fore is lefs frequently unfound,) it will be fufiicient, in mofl cafes, to make one deep incifion to its bot- tom, after which its fides wiil frequently wafie away by digeftives and bandage ; but ihould this prove infufficient, cfcharotics fnould be fprinkled between the lips, and be occafionally repeated, till the iungus lliall fubfide. This effeaed, proper digeflives Ihould be continued, by which the uifchaige Will bo kept up.

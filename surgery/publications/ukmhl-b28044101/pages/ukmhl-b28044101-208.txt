disorders 26 always add to the complaint. But in cafes of con- flitutio.nal ophthalmias, and particularly in fcro- phulous habits, a perfedly ereft pofture, throughout the day, with the head raifed as much as may be, at night, is elfeiVtially neceffarj'', and eminently ufeful; infomuch that frequently, no means of cure will fuc- ceed unlefs this be very ftridtly attended to. In re- peated inflammations, in patients of fuch a habit of body, I have known this alone efficacious, after many means had been prefcribed in vain by men of long experience, and where an obftinate inflammation had been kept up for feveral w'eeks, and the patient unable to endure the lead glimmering of light, or to open the eye-lids without the moft excruciating pain. And fuch ophthalmias, indeed, very frequently need nothing more than this caution, except it be to give a laxative occafionally, and to touch the eye-lids, now and then, with an ointment I fliall prefently mention; andefpeclally toadmitlight gradually intotheroom,as the patient fhall be able bear it. In regard to medi- cine, nothing, I believe, does fo much good as the bark. reafon, reading in the dulk of the evening, and then, fuddenly, by a ftrong candle-light, may induce mifchief in weak and dif- tempered eyes, that may not be difcovered till too late to be re- medied. I fliall clofe this note by obferving, that when reading a fmall print, without the help of glafles, becomes painful, fuch reading fliould be laid afide; as glafles, in this cafe, only ftrain the eyes, and Ihould never be taken up till a uniform neceffity fliall oblige, and then fliould aot afterwards be laid afide ; it being a fliock to the optic nerves to have the like objedls varioully repre- feiited, perhaps a hundred tiiius in a day. and

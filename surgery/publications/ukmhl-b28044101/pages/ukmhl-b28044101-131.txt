The digeflives are ilill continued when the efcharotics are left off, and the parts being, by thefe means, put into adlion, in- general nothing farther is required, than to wait till nature is able to accomplHh her proper work.

Such au idea agrees very well with the theory I have adopted, and which every day’'s expe- rience has confirmed. Dr. Wall, indeed, in one place fpeaks of the coldnefs, and aftringency of the Malvcni-wotcrs externally applied.

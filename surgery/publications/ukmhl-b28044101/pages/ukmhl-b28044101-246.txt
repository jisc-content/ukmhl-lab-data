64 STRICTURES members; many of whom continue only a year or two in London. The Inftitution, in fome refpedts, more rciembling that of Paris, is with the College of Phyfidans, whole Fellozus, at dated times, read papers, dra|j;n v\p byjhemfelves and others, on medical fub- jedls. But though their judgment and impartiality will not be fufpedfed, and their feledtion of papers may give more fatisfadtion, than any private editors; yet this inftitution likewife falls Ihort of the prefent in- tention : for befides that their plan is too limited, their readings and obfervations are-not open to the- p1-ofeffio.nâ€˜ in general, and efpedally to the younger part of it, who have every thing to learn. For the w'ant of fuch an Inftitution, young men, efpedally fuch as are to pradife in the metropolis, are conftrained to read a great deal, and often at a ven- ture or if they do not, they will lofe many a ufeful hint that is to be picked up in various works where but little might be expeded. On the other hand, many a point of ufeful knowledge is loft, or confined to a very fmall circle, not fo much for its want of importance, as from its being oftentimes a fingle ob- fdvation, which for want of an cafy mode of com- rhunication, can circulate only in a way of conver- fation; whereby the young artift, conceiving him- lelf unlikely to receive the credit of the obfervation, very frequently confines it to himlelf. But Societies with the firft Phyficians and Surgeons at their head, and open, under proper regulations, to all the ftu- dents in medicine, where public fpeaking, and read- ing of Ihort papers were encouraged, the lubjedts properly.

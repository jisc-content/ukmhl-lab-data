And indeed, were ulcers fuch very- tradable, methodical things, as the pidure repre- fents, memory might fupply the place of judgment, and this part of furgery would be reduced to arith- metical exadnefs.

But we are always to know our proper place, art being in this, and in every other inftance, a mere hand-maid to nature, to lend affiftance in a way the moft agreeable to her own laws. In the introdudion to this little work, an at- tempt has been made to reduce the principles of the cure of ulcers to two only, viz. an attention to the general vigor of the conftitution, and to the adion of the parts ; but with this view, it may be neceftary to pay fome regard to the nature of the different pro- cefles that are going on in the healing of every ulcer.

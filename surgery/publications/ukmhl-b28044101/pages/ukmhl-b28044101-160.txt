’A TREATISE upoit 130 few days, and the fuppnradvc cataplafm,* * fupported lightly by a . flannel roller, about a week longer, never fail to leflen the moft troublefome fymptoms, and lb far to fubdue them, as to render this ulcer more traftabie under ordinary means. That kind of drefling, befides every other advantage, has that of abforbing, and therefore, flieathing the corrolive, and cauftic difcharge, increaled by moft other dref- flngs, to the great aggravation of the fore. When the callous edges become fofr, their Inequa- lities are removed, and a fine Ikin begins to cover them, the poultice may be difeontinued, and the ulcer be dreflfed with fome mild fuppurative ointment, with the occafional addition of a little faturnine cerate, which is peculiarly friendly to this irritable fore, or fbmetimes, the cerate made with crocus martis; but more frequently, the beft application, in this ftate, is Goulard's cerate and bole juft now mentioned.“p By poultice, and that now .recommended, is made ufe of, is fuch, that although the former is feldom of much fervice, unlefs it be' preferved warm, by the patient being confined to his bed, the latter, from its potential warmth, willanfwer tolerably well when lightly fupported by a flannel roller, though the patient be fuffered to walk j which he may do, not only about the houfe, but to the furgeon’s to be drefled, or examined, as I have repeatedly proved. * See page io§.' ' -j- Befldes experience, fuch ointments have the fandlion of all the old writers from the time of Galen, who conflantly advife fome preparation of lead with the abforbent earths, or other pow- defj for this malignant and eatin^ uleer. • •• thefe

133 A TREATISE ufon ' cafes, in this refped:, approach the neareft to the ulcers in queflion, of which the old fkin can be brought over only a fmall part of the furface, and the reft is covered entirely by new. In all fuch cafes, the aftringent lotion already hinted at will won- derfully affift the cure, by enabling nature to con- tradt the furface, and leflen the dimenfions of the lore. But however, and whenever bracing applications are ufed to the legs, they fhould not be continued throughout the cure, nor longer than is abfclutely neceflary ; but being gradually weakened, the laft ftage fltould be effedted, if poffible, by ordinary means, and with the cautions laid down in the fore- going pages. The folution may freqently be made ufe of merely to vvafh the furface of the fore, or fometimes may be applied on a piece of double linen, (for lint flicks too clofe to the furface) its edges, (in very bad cafes) being firft fpread with any mild cerate,to prevent them from adhering too tightly to the Ikin, and thereby confining the difeharge; and Ihould therefore be fomewhat larger than the ulcer. There are, how- ever, fome very large fores that require a more ef- fectual method, and the folution is more adv'an- tageoufiy applied, for a ftiort time, on a thin piece arc apt to fay, that the conlUtmion long acenflomed to the dif- chaige, IS thereby indifpofcd to fulTer the ulcer to clofe.

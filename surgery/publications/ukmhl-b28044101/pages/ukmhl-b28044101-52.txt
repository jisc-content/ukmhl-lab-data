•INTRODUCTION. Si w mention one fact that-may merit fome attention ; viz^ that not only by medicineSj but by mere external ap- plications',. it is frequently in the furgeon’s power to alter both the appearance, and the quantity of matter difcharged from a fore, as every man of any experi- ence mud often have had occafion to obferve. • But, the idea of true pus being a diflblution of the mufcular and cellular fubftance, &c. may, in another point of view, feem to demand a little farther atten- tion. In fupport of this opinion, we are told, that in- every colledlion of matter, there is adlually very con- liderable lofs of’fubftance in the part, and for proof of it vve are pointed to the, cavity from whence the matter has flowed, on the burfting, or opening of the abfcefs, and to the difappearance of the cellular and adipofe membrane; the greateft part of which, how'r ever, feems only to be condenfed. To examine this point a little more narrowly, let us take a view of it •where the fa<ft ought to be the moft evident, as in the cafe of large impofthumations, fuch as the pfoas abfcefs; from whence a pint, or more, of matter has. run out on the fpontaneous giving way, or artificial opening of the integuments. In fuch cafes, has there been a deftruaion of mufcle, veflels, cellular and adipofe membrane, equal to the quantity of pus, or the cavity that is formed ? What ! a pound * of muf- cle and adipofe membrane deftroyed ? A bulk. ♦ Experimenta on living animals have lately been made to fup- port fuch an opinion. equal

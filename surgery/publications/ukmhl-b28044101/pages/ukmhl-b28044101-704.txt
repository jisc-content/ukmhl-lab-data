244 appendix. Some obfervations have beerv commufil- cated to the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris, of the radical cure of the broncho- cele having been obtained, by making an incifion on each fide the tumour, and then, by the introdudlion of a feton, to promote an internal fuppuration. In particular cafes, where an external opening hath been made, Monf. Louis, a Surgeon of the firft eminence at Paris, affirms, that, if there is no reafon (on account of a fcirrhous hardnefs) to fuppofe the tumour will de- generate into a cancer, he attacks the com- plaint with the cauflic flone; and when the efchar feparates, by reiterated applica- tions of the cauftic, he puffies on into the centre of the gland. This' procefs not only, Le fays, occafions a deftrudion of the fubftance of the part, but, that after- wards, proper external refolvent applica- tions may be appfied with advantage, which before the opening of th'e tumour, may have been ufed without the lead; bene- fit. Monf. Louis farther^oblerves, that in fome of thefe cafes, wanders may be done with butter of antimony, ufed with dif- cretion.

54 A TREATISE UPON they are ufed chiefly to fores in a certain flate, which will very well endure them, and are rendered very tolerable at the worfl, by means of that exercrfe fo continually inculcated. For I am conftantly told by patients to whom they have been the mofl: freely ufed, that walking always mitigates the pain, which accordingly is feverefl in bed, at whatever time of the day they have been applied. Nor ought I to omit aflerting, that filling a fore with mercur. corrof. ruber, affords very little more pain, than modcr rately fprinkling it on the part; befides which, we are to confider that one drefling in this manner fre- quently fuperfedes the neceffity of many repetitions of it, in a more moderate way. Another objedion may arife from the ftimulus, fuch applications will occafion, endangering inflam- mation, and rendering an ill-conditioned fore flill more obflinate, by producing a fliarp and ichorous difeharge more abundantly corrofive. This is cer- tainly true in a few cafes, of which I lhall fpeak in their proper place, but in a general way, fadts prove ‘ diredfly the contrary; fores on the legs require a flimulus, '* and it has been faid, are not eafily provoked to inflammation. I have applied the red precipitate to fores exquifitely tender and painful, difeharging nothing but a thin ichor, which has co- vered the furrounding fkin with heated pimples, and * WisEMyVN obferves, that “applications to thefe ulcers ought to have a temperate heat ; and whatever objeftions” (fays he) may be made againft even cauftic applications, where milder onps take no place, we proceed to the llronger.” fmaU

But fhould this, or any other plan fail of pro- ducing fome amendment, it ought not to be long perfevered in, as it is poffible we may have miftaken both the caufe of the difeafe and the conftitution of the patient; for if our remedies be properly adapted, however rapid the progrefs of the gangrene may have been, it will ufiially be very foon checked.

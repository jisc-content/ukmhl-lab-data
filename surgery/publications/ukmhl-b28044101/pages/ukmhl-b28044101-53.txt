23 INTRODUCTION. tqunl to a pint, or more, of matter ?—We may, in- deed, find the mufcles feparated one from another, and the cellular membrane torn away by the weight of the fluid ; or fometimes a mufcle divided longitu- dinally, or its belly eaten through ; but the idea of ■a whole pound of organized parts being loft, or melted down into matter, is really much more improbable than any thing that has been advanced concerning the formation of pus, or dq^rine of the abforption of parts into the conftitution. For whatever ^las been faid on the latter, is merely to account for a lofs of parts, which fometimes actually difappear in the pro- cefs of ulceration ; but the former opinion fuppofes a quantity of parts to be deftroyed, (in order to account for exceflive fuppuration) where there is no fuch ma- nifeft difappearancc. Moreover, in largecolledions of matter, there is not only a prodigious difeharge on the firft burfting of the abfeefs, but it often continues im- moderate for days, and even for months, till the pati- ent is deftroyed by it: yet upon opening the body, only a very Imall portion of mufcle appears to be loft, and there is little, or no more deficiency of adipofe membrane in the part, than throughout the reft of the body; the whole of which, in fuch cafes, is exceedingly emaciated, and the fat fuppofed to have been abforb- ed.

A TREATISE upon 82 Not that troubling patients with ufelefs medicines, and the little unnecelTary expence, of importance, indeed, to fome people, are the principal objediens on this head ; but the great mifchief is, that in molt cafes, the furgeon’s thoughts being hereby led off to a wrong objed, he is diverted from an attention to the true means of affording relief. Inllead, therefore, of making the moft of the particular habit of each in- dividual, by proper topical applications and general remedies, he is contriving how he may remove fome imaginary, or at the moft, fome unknown complaint, or to cure a manifeft dyferacy, for which he is not likely to find an adequate remedy. But fhould the time come, when fome real alterative, or peculiar tonic fhall be difeovered that may co-operate with the furgeon^s defigns, I fhall be as ready as others to' embrace it. Wherever ulcers are conneded with evident dif- eafe of the fyftem, it has been granted, the affiftance and to purify it from the foreign leven with which it is infefted. To this end he gives us fix general indications. “ I. Si le maladeala verole, Ic fcorbut, ou les ecrouelles. 2. Si “ le fang eft charge de bile. 3. Si le fang eft acre et fale fans erre charge de bile. 4. Si le fang pcche par etre trop epais, et “ trop refineux, 5. Si Ton juge qiie le fang foit trop fereux. “ 6. En gcncrale, il faur, dans tous les cas, purger fouvent le “ malade, mais le purger doucement j lui donner tous les jours “ line ou deux prifes de quinquina; et lui faire obferver on regime ** exatft, tant pour la quantite, qiie pour la qualite de la nou- “ riture*”—If the reader can acquire any praftical knowledge from the moft of thefe indicatijns, I muft contels he has greatly the advantage of me. of

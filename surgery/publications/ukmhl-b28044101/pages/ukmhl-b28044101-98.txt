6^ A TREATISE upon cold weather, has long appeared to me a matter of very confiderabie advantage.* The manner of applying it, it has been faid, re- quires nothing but care. Every one knows that tight bandage fhould begin at fome diftance below, and be carried fome way above the parts it is chiefly defigned to comprefs ; otherwife, the matter attempting to iffue from the ulcer, being confined by the tight preflTure upon it, will force a paflage wherever it finds a lefs refiflance, and thus convert a Ample ulcer into a fiftulous fore. But for ulcers on the legs, efpecially where exer- cife is allowed, this rule fliould be confiderably ex- tended, and the bandage (which ought to be about four inches wide) fliould begin as far below, and be carried as much above the affedted part as the limb will'allow of. To this end, it fliould commence at the extremity of the foot, where it fliould be drawn very tight, (the end of the roller firfl: croffing the inflep) and after being brought two or three times over the ancle, fliould afeend fpirally (the edge of one turn of the roller being not more than about an inch from another) till it rifes to the calf of the leg. Here the flridlure ought to be lefs, to permit a free adtion of the mufcles, and the turns therefore be foniewhat more diftant ; in which manner it muft be continued up to the knee : above this part it would be im- proper to carry it, though recommended by con- * Sec Bell, On Ulcers, Part ii. ยง. 2. fiderable

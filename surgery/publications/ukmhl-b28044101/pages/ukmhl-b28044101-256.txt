^4 STRICTURES may be farther promoted by proper dofes of the bark, taken on the next day. The pundtured part Ihould alfo be touched with the lunar cauftic, or if the in- jury be confiderable, with the cauftic alkali, which will penetrate deeper. Having given thefe brief hints, I lhall now clofe with fome fimilar refledtions on topical applications. When the probable caufe of the gangrene has been . difeovered, together with the general habit, and pre- fent circumttances of the patient, the furgeon will be at no lofs how to adapt his applications and dreffings; and this fhould be invariably done.

Here, emollient and relaxing fomenta- tions, poultices, and ointments, are the moft likely to abate the inflammation, to liberate the veflels of the â€¢parr, and affift nature to feparate the efehar. Oh the other hand, poultices of ftale beer and oat- meal, fo frequently and indiferiminately applied to fphacelated parts, are not only always improper where there is much true inflammation, but even in the atonic flate, often do harm from their weight : in the former cafe, a poultice of fine linfeed-meal with a little ointment of Elder-flowers, will be found preferable; for the latter, a foft bread and milk poultice with a good deal of theriaca. For gangrenes in old people, and often for thofe of infants, efpe- 'cially if the gangrene is fmall, the theriaca alone is a very

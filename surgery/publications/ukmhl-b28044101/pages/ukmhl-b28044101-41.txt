INTRODUCTON, ano, or forelegs, when they grow older; the circulation of the blood through the more extreme parts, and their confequent tone, being then impaired : and every fur- geon knows how much more frequently a gangrene is found to feize the feet or the toes, than any other part of the body. For although the fingers, with, their veflels equally fmall, are at a confiderable dif- tance from the heart, yet the circulation in them is more vigorous, both on account of their veiTels com- ing from the beginning of the aorta, and the conti- nued exercife from their more conftant ufe. The lower extremities being fiill farther diftant, and not fo much engaged, have thefe difadvantages compen- fated by the exercife nature has impofed upon them, in the fupport and conveyance of the whole body; for the want of which neceflary fiimulus, in indolent and fedentary people, the circulation becomes too languid to preferve their due tone. From this caufe, as well as from the anatomy of their parts, it is eafy to account for the fwelling of the feet and ancles, fo common in fuch perfons, as well as for that which happens from the limb having been kept, for any length of time, in an horizontal pofition : for here, W'hilft the moles movenda is great, the vires moventes are diminifhed.

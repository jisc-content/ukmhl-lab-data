ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 127 applying a poultice a few days, I am not afraid of fuppreffing by thefe means ; and indeed have found medicines incapable of doing it. Where almoft the whole leg has been affedted, a fcurf, or fcab, will remain for a coniiderable time, which muft not be haftily rubbed off. But the parts may, now and then, be touched with a little unguent, cierul. mit. and at other times be walhed with the drying folution till the fcales fall off of therafelves, or are very eafily feparated ; at which time the fkin will be found, and perfedtly fmooth underneath.

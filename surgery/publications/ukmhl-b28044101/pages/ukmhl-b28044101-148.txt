ii8 A TREATISE upon great part of his work to do over again. For this- reafoiij dry lint, blue vitriol,* nor hard comprefs, Ihould never be ufed, though I know they have fuc- ceeded for a prefent cure in feveral inllances. The cafe, indeed, is different, when patients, at this period, are confined, dieted, and purged, (though upon that plan fores are not fo foon brought into a good flate ;) fuch applications may then both agree, and expedite the healing of the fore; but fuch ulcers being rather deficcated by art, than cicatrized by nature, many fuch patients muft foon make application again. The habit is to be firfl: gradually relieved, and to fpeak a popular language, the humors are to run off, and the change from a long accufiomed, or copious drain, to be cautioufly effedted ; but which gradually abating as the wound diminifhes in its fize, nature, however averfe to fudden tranfitions, will when left to herfelf, in a reafonable time find fome other vent. * Wiseman experienced this in a cafe that appeared to be going on well, but fuddenly turned foul, and in a few days be- came as bad as ever. (Book H, ch. q.) This, however, feems to have been his ufual method, and it muft be acknowledged, that fome ulcers on the legs healed in this manner may ftand well, but there is no adequate rule to determine by ; and therefore would a furgeon be certain of healing an ulcer, and perfei5ling a cure, that muft not be his method. -j-See Mr. Else’s paper in the Med.

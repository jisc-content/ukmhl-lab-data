A TREATISE 1 14 UPON a perfectly healthy appearance, this change in the dreffing fhould begin, which lliould be repeatedly weakened, three or four times, at fuch intervals as the fize of the fore, and the time fuppofed neceflary for its cure, fliall point out. But great caution is re- quired not to be too hafty in this, or to continue it, if the difeharge is {fill very confiderable. An at- tempt to fupprefs this is always improper, and if it fucceeds, will, indeed, divert the difeharge fome other way for a rime, but without any advanatge to the patient; and the matter inftead of burfting through the fkin, where that happens to be difeafed, will form a paffage in different places through the furface of- the. fore. In this cafe, the bandage ffiould be drawn tighter below the feat of the ulcer, and the matter by preffure with the fingers, at each dreffing, fliould be carefully forced up ; the furgeon muff lixkewife return to more adlive applications, by which the fore will foon recover a more pleafant ap- pearance. But if no fuch change fliould prefently take place, either more time is required to cleanfe fome diffempered parts in the ulcer, or elfe the whole fore is unfound to the bottom. In the former cafe, time, it has been faid, will do every thing that is wanted; but if it does not, recourfe muff be had again to.efcharotics, which, if the bone be not dif- eafed, will invigorate the parts, and foon improve the difeharge ; or if ffrongcr be ufed, a thick flough will be made, and the furface, the moment that is thrown off', will be clean, and will put on a promifing appearance -a gain. ^ ^ Upon

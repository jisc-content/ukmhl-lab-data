CASES.AND HEMARKS I HAVE before attempted to prove, that all warm relaxant applications are very per- nicious, when tenfion hath already taken place in the limb; and if fo, very little need be faid to fhew the impropriety of their ufe, when the defign of the furgeon is to prevent inflammation, to refifl; the di- latation of the vefTels, and thereby retrain ’the confequent tumefaftion and fuppura- tion within as fmall bounds as may be. I do not know any better method to anfwer 'thefe intentions, in general, than to apply a very foft napkin, well foaked in the fa- turnine water of Goulard, cold^ all over -^the injured limb. As foon as it becomes dry, a frefh lotion fhould be poured on, and this fhould be continued during the firfl days, or until all inflammatory ap- pearances have fubfided. It fometimes happens, that one or more of the deep-feated veins are lacerat- ed, and if the wound of the integuments is fmall, or becomes choaked up with co- agulable lymph, the extravafated blood will force its way betwixt the fkin and ♦> mufclea.

pre'face; xix attention of praflitloners of every rank, which the writer feels himfelf junified in doing, by the beft of motives—from the' benefit it has afforded to fo m^any poor fufferers fince the for- mer edition appeared. Agreeably to thefe aflertions, he could refer O to various other teftimonies he has received in the courfe of the lafi: two years. Out of thefe, however, he has ventured to feledl a letter, (not more flattering than many others) which how- foever regarded in refpect to himfelf, he has thought it a juflice to tlie Public to fubjoin to this preface.

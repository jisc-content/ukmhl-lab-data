65 GENERAL TREATMENT OF FRACTURES. patient such use of the forearm and hand as would he far better than any artificial substitute. In any case it is a good rule for the surgeon to wait until the patient asks for the removal of the limb; and to satisfy himself, before consenting to a resort to this extreme measure, that there is no available method of restoring some degree at least of the usefulness of the part. Treatment of Union with Deformity.—If from restlessness or insubor- dination on the part of the patient, a fracture is found to be uniting in bad position, no time should be lost in correcting the deformity, and in so modi- fying the dressings as to make a more efficient retention of the fragments. The means of doing this must vary with the part concerned, and with the circumstances under which the treatment is conducted. Occasionally, the end may be gained by gradual pressure with properly padded splints ; but, gene- rally speaking, it is the better plan to bring the bone into good shape at once, the patient being etherized if necessary; and this may often be done with the surgeon’s hands applied at either end of the bone, while his knee is used as a fulcrum. Should the union be already too firm for such force to be effective, the bone may be straightened over the padded edge of a table, with the aid of assistants. Or an “ osteoclast,” such as that represented in Fig. 592, devised by Dr. C. F. Taylor, of Flew York, may be employed. In Fig. 592. whatever way the thing be done, care should be taken to exert, the force ex- actly on the spot desired, and to get as much leverage on the bone as possi- ble ; otherwise greater pressure will be necessary, or a second fracture may be produced at some other portion of the bone. The soft parts should always be well protected, and pressure upon large vessels or nerves should be studiously avoided.

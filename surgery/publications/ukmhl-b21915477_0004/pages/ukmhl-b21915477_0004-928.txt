INJURIES OF THE BACK. into, the spinal canal. Otherwise, the suppurative meningitis would pretty certainly have caused paralysis by compressing the spinal cord with the in- flammatory products. The clinical history of this ladâ€™s case, interpreted by the post-mortem ap- pearances, appears to have been as follows: The blow on his back wrenched the saero-vertebral articulation, and caused a suppurative inflammation to be lighted up therein, particularly on the left side, and in consequence of this, purulent matter escaped in an outward direction, and led to the forma- tion of an immense lumbo-sacral abscess ; it likewise escaped in an inward direction, and caused the theca vertebralis to become softened and perforated, and extensively destroyed, and a diffuse suppurative inflammation, which extended upward to the brain, to be kindled in the spinal arachnoid. More- over, the account of the case presented above gives the symptoms by which each of these periods, or stages, in the progress of the case was characterized. The symptoms indicative of the joint inflammation were pain in and sore- ness of the joint itself, and these were to some extent relieved by leeching. The Fig. 811.

(Hilton.) formation of the lumbo-sacral abscess was attended by a return of the joint- pain, followed by pyrexia, and by the appearance of a swelling which, on being opened, discharged purulent matter. The spinal meningitis set in with severe pain in the spinal column, and irritative fever, followed by extreme

In considering the general condition of the patient, when the question of operation arises, the surgeon must remember that these are essentially chronic cases, and that there can seldom be any justification for haste in operating, when by delaying a few weeks, or even months, the patient may be placed by constitutional and hygienic treatment in a more favorable con- dition to sustain whatever operation may be necessary. The presence of visceral disease, whether of the lungs or abdominal organs, must usually be considered a positive contraindication to excision, and under these circum- stances, unless the local condition of the knee render amputation imperative, no operation should, as a rule, he performed. On the other hand, if the patient presents no evidence of visceral disease, and the general health seems to be directly suffering from the irritation arising from the diseased joint, the timely removal of the source of disturbance either by excision or amputa- tion may prove the starting-point of rapid convalescence. The duration of the malady must be considered by the surgeon in any case of knee-joint disease before deciding upon the propriety of an operation. I am not one of those who hold that a surgeon is bound invariably to wait a certain number of weeks or months to give, as is often said, a “ fair trial” to other treatment before recommending an operation, for I believe that a thor- ough knowledge of the course and natural history of the disease will often enable him to say at once whether any particular case can or cannot he bene- fited by expectant measures. In their early stages, as I have before re- marked, these knee-joint affections are quite amenable to treatment, and hence, putting out of the question some few cases of very rapid articular disorganization in which amputation is required, a judicious surgeon would in cases of recent origin endeavor to obtain, and would probably succeed in obtaining, a natural cure by placing the joint in good position, and at rest, by relieving intra-articular pressure by the use of continuous extension, and by combating the morbid process by careful constitutional and local treat- ment. In a recent case, then, an operation can seldom be required ; on the other hand, if the disease has lasted many years, the process of natural cure (such as it is) being pretty well advanced, and the patient perhaps past the age at

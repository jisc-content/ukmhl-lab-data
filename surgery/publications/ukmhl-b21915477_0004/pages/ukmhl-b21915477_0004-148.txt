INJURIES OF BONES. 118 A thorough familiarity with the muscular attachments afforded by the humerus, will enable the student of the fractures of this bone to comprehend much more readily the mechanism of their production, as well as of the resulting displacement. This matter will be further referred to in connection with the fractures of different portions of the bone. Fractures of the humerus may be divided roughly, and for general pur- poses, into those of the upper end, those of the shaft, and those of the lower end. Under each of these heads are comprised several varieties, distinct in their anatomical and clinical features. But before entering upon the dis- cussion of these, I would call attention to the curious statistics presented by Gurlt1 as to the influence of age and sex upon their relative frequency. Of 194 cases of fracture of the humerus, there were— Between 1 and 10 years of age, 62 cases, or over 31 per cent. it 11 “ 20 “ 42 a a 21 it it 21 “ 30 “ 22 ii it 11 it ii 31 “ 40 “ 16 44 nearly a a 9 a a 41 “ 50 “ 9 5 a ii 51 “ 60 “ 22 44 over 11 a ii 61 “ 70 “ 16 44 nearly 9 a “ 71 “ 80 “ 5 it ii 3 a Malgaigne’s statistics present a different view. He says that of 310 cases of simple fracture of the humerus, there were— From 2 to 20 years of age, 45 cases, or over 14 per cent. “ 20 “ 40 “ 80 “ “ 25 it “ 40 “ 60 “ 105 “ “ 33 it “ 60 “ 80 and over 80 “ “ 25 a The remarkable discrepancy between these two sets of figures must be at once apparent, but I confess that no explanation of it occurs to me. blow as to the relative frequency of fractures of the various portions of the bone at different ages, Gurlt gives the following:— Age. Upper eud. Shaft. Lower end. Between 1 and 10 4 = over 6 per cent.2 14 == over 22 per cent. 44 = 70 per cent. it ii < i 20 11 = < ( 26 a 10 = 25 i i 21 = 50 it 21 ii 30 3 = a 13 11 13 = 59 i ( 6 = over 27 “ ii 31 ii 40 3 = a 18 a 5 = over 31 it 8 = 50 ii 41 ii 50 6 = 11 66 a 2 = “ 22 it 1 = 11 “ a 51 it 60 11 = i i 50 a 9 = “ 40 it 2 = 9 “ a 61 it 70 8 = a 50 a 7 = nearly 44 tl 1 = over 6 “ a 71 it 80 2 = a 40 a 2 = 40 it 1 = 20 “ 48 62 84 194 The reader will scarcely fail to observe the great preponderance of frac- tures at the lower end of the humerus in the first two decades of life, and the increase of those of the upper end of the bone between the ages of 51 and 60— the time when, although active pursuits are not yet abandoned, the ability to avoid falls is diminished. As to the influence of sex, I will merely say that the males are very largely in excess of the females in every portion of Gurlt’s table except four; in the first decade of life the fractures of the shaft, and between 71 and 80 years those of the upper end as well as of the shaft, show equal numbers for the two 1 Op. cit., Bd. ii.

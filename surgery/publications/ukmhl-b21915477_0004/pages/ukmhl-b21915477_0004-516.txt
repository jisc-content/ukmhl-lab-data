486 EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. 1 Op. cit., Third Surgical Volume, page 875. My personal experience of these operations is limited to partial excisions, twice of considerable portions of the radius, in cases of gunshot fracture (one a primary and one a secondary operation), and once of the same bone in a Fig. 710. Excision of the radius. case of ununited fracture, in which, after resecting the hone, I secured the fragments together with wire sutures, after the manner of Prof. Ollier and Prof. Bigelow. All of these operations Eig. 711. were successful, though in both the cases of gunshot fracture the patients went through sharp attacks of pyiemia before recovering. The appearance of the limb in the case of primary resection is shown in the accompa- nying illustration. (Fig. 711.) The results in these cases are usually quite satisfactory as regards the life of the patient, and even as regards utility of the preserved limb, though if any considerable portion be removed from either bone alone, there is apt to he marked deformity with deflection of the hand toward the affected side. Even in cases of myeloid tumor of the hones, which are usually considered to require amputation, success, as has already been mentioned, has followed excision in the hands of Mr. Lucas and Mr. Morris. The following table, com- Result of partial excision of the radius (From piled from the statistics luillislied by DlS a patient in the Episcopal Hospital.) Otis and Huntington,1 shows that the mor tality of the operation in military practice is very smallâ€”considerably less than that which attends amputation of the fore- arm ; so that in favorable cases, and particularly when one bone only is involved, and when the laceration of the soft parts is not extensive, the opera- tion may be properly resorted to. Heyfelder tabulates 39 cases, derived mainly from the records of civil life, without a single death, and with 34 more or less perfect successes as regards the restoration of function.

EXCISION OF THE IIIP-JOINT. 499 embraced in Dr. Culbertson’s well-known prize-essay, already so often referred to. The effect of age in influencing the result of the operation is as clearly marked as in the case of other articulations, the most favorable period of life for this excision being that between the ages of five and ten years, and the mortality in adult life being so large as only to justify the operation in excep- tional instances. To illustrate this point, I have compiled the following table from Dr. Culbertson’s figures of excisions for disease:— Table showing Results of Excision of the Hip-joint foe Hip-disease at Diffekent Ages. Age. Total. Recovered. Died. Result unde- termined. Mortality per cent, of termi- nated cases. Under 5 years 51 29 18 4 38.3 Between 5 and 10 years 162 102 48 12 32.0 “ 10 “ 15 “ 85 40 35 10 46.7 “ 15 “ 20 “ 52 22 26 4 54.2 “ 20 “ 30 “ 39 u 22 6 66.7 Over 30 years 26 9 14 3 60.9 Age not stated 55 21 29 5 58.0 Aggregates 470 234 192 44 45.1 The effect of the patient’s constitutional condition upon the result of the ope- ration is, perhaps, less obvious than in the case of the other joints, for the reason that the subjects of hip-excision are, with few exceptions, all in im- paired health. It may be said, however, that advanced visceral disease and exhaustion from long-continued and profuse suppuration, greatly diminish the chances of recovery, and that the most promising cases are those in which, in spite of the local disease, the patients have maintained a fair state of general health. At the same time, statistics lend no support to the views of those who advocate early excision in the treatment of hip-clisease, Dr. Cul- bertson’s figures showing very clearly that the operation is most successful in cases of from 9 to 18 months’ duration:— Table showing Results of Excision of the IIip-joint in cases of Hip- disease of Different Duration.

The operation is almost never required for the relief of accidents met with in civil life, but the two cases of this kind referred to by Dr. Culbertson both terminated fatally, while in military practice, the mortality of the procedure, as shown by the table on

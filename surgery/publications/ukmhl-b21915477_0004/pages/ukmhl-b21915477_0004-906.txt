850 INJURIES OF THE BACK. To epitomize the anatomical lesions which usually accompany the neuro- pathic inflammations of the urinary organs that occur in cases of spinal injury: They are hypenemia, more or less intense, according to the case, with tumefaction and dark-red or purple discoloration of the mucous mem- brane lining the kidneys, the ureters, and the bladder; intense hypersemia with tumefaction of the renal parenchyma, and of the walls of the ureters and bladder; fibrinous exudation in patches on the mucous membrane lining these organs; extravasated blood in both a fluid and coagulated state in the pelves of the kidneys, the canals of the ureters, and the cavity of the bladder; suppuration of the secreting portions of the kidneys, and abscess of their pelves; inflammatory thickening of the coats of the bladder and ureters, with softening and erosions of their lining or mucous membrane. In such cases, patches of the mucous membrane are apt to be cast off as sloughs, and the inflammatory process, being violent, generally involves also or extends to the other tunics of the bladder and ureters, as well as to the parenchyma of the kidneys: As a rule, the inflammatory process in such cases does not appear to start in the bladder and spread thence into the kidneys, nor vice versa ; but it is simultaneously kindled in all parts of the mucous membrane belonging to the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. In chronic cases, phosphatic calculi form in the kidneys, as well as in the bladder, and in either place they may set up fatal irritation. Thus, it will be perceived that the inflammatory process which is set up in the mucous membrane of the urinary organs by certain morbid excitations of the spinal cord, bears, at least “ in the acute” instances, no inconsiderable resemblance to the necrotic processes which are set up in the integuments by the operation of the same causes. The destructive process in both is charac- terized by intense, dark-colored hypersemia, extravasation of blood from rup- tured capillaries, and sloughing of the tissues involved. In the less severe or chronic cases, the urinary mucous membrane exhibits pathological changes quite analogous to the cutaneous erythema and other diffuse phlogoses of the integuments which are caused by similar lesions of the spinal cord, that have been described above. Furthermore, it is highly probable that when the urinary secretion comes into contact with the inflamed mucous membrane of the bladder, ureters, etc., it suffers decomposition in consequence of such contact, just as happens in ordinary cyTstitis; by which decomposition it acquires highly irritating pro- perties that in turn may react upon the already inflamed mucous membrane, and augment its disorder. The urine rots while lying in the bladder, in such cases, not because the walls of the bladder may chance to be paralyzed at the time, as Mr. Shaw and others have vainly asserted, but because it there becomes tainted with the products of the inflammatory process which is going on in the bladder, the ureters, and the kidneys. This statement is fully borne out by what occurred in the peracute example just now related— the example in which a young soldier had sustained fracture without dis- placement of the fifth cervical vertebra in consequence of diving headforemost into shallow water: on the fifteenth day after the accident, there supervened a neuropathic inflammation of his kidneys, ureters, and bladder, which caused death in ten days, although he had been able to pass his water at will for a week previously (which proves that the bladder-paralysis had been absent for a week), and although it was not necessary to use a catheter on him again until three days after the urinary disorder had appeared, and then the instrument was introduced, not because the bladder was paralyzed, but because its urethral orifice was choked with blood-clot arising from hsematuria. Moreover, to say that in such a case the rotting urine produced an inflammation of the

CONTUSIONS OP BONES. 259 three middle metatarsal bones broken by the wheel passing over them. The anterior fragments were very greatly depressed; there was a lacerated wound on the back of the foot, and the inflammation was most intense. It was therefore impossible to remedy the displacement, and, indeed, the saving of the foot could hardly be hoped for. The patient recovered, and could plant his foot very firmly on the ground, but the great projection of the upper fragments at the back of the foot obliged him to wear a peculiarly-shaped shoe.” Hammond1 reports a case of compound comminuted fracture of the right ankle as well as of the first and second metatarsal bones of the left foot, in which the patient made a good recovery without amputation. Boyd, however, has recorded2 the case of a woman, aged fifty-nine, with fracture of the four outer metatarsal bones, followed by thrombosis of the femoral artery, pulmonary embolism, and death. Such cases are not very uncommon among the broken-down subjects of hospital treatment. Fractures of the phalanges of the toes are very rare, except from great direct violence. Yet I have several times seen them produced by accidents to persons bathing at the seashore, without serious injury to the soft parts, the pain, crepitation, and abnormal mobility placing the character of the lesion beyond doubt. In these cases the treatment is the same as for like injuries to the phalanges of the fingers, although the small size of the parts renders the aplication of splints at the same time more difficult and less need- ful. A little bit of pasteboard may be laid along the back of the toe, and hound on with a strip of adhesive plaster. I have never seen permanent lameness follow a hurt of this kind. Compound fractures of the toes, as a rule, require amputation ; hut there is room for the exercise of judgment in deciding this question, as nature will sometimes do more in the way of repair than might at first be thought likely or even possible. The risk of tetanus from such injuries ought never to be wholly overlooked. Other Injuries of Bones. Besides fractures, the bones are liable to other forms of injury concerning which the surgeon should not be ignorant. Contusions of bones are not very uncommon; and although the soft parts are also bruised, and the soreness in them masks that of the bone, yet there is often perceptible for a long time a deep-seated tenderness which gives evi- dence that the bone has suffered. Such injuries generally affect the super- ficial bones, and especially the tibia, which is very aj:>t to be hurt in the rough sports of boyhood. As a rule nature repairs the damage inflicted in this way; but occasionally the results are more serious, and inflammation may ensue ; the periosteum may swell, and necrosis of the underlying bony substance, or perhaps osteitis, may follow. In rare instances, and probably only where there is a constitutional vice, the nutrition of the entire bone becomes in- volved, and its inflammation or its death may take place. Or, if the dis- order be more localized, an abscess may form in the cancellous substance, and give rise to very troublesome symptoms. The treatment of contusions of bone consists in the enforcement of rest, and the use of hot-water dressings, and perhaps leeches; but it is seldom that 1 Trans, of the New Hampshire Medical Society, 1882, p. 105. s Trans, of the Pathological Society of London, vol. xxxiii. 1882.

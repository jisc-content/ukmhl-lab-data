483 EXCISION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. 2 Op. cit., p. 488. Op. cit., p. 482. 3 See Table on page 444. The circumstances which most influence the results of elbow-joint excision, are the age and constitutional condition of the patient, and the nature of the affection for which the operation is performed. To show the effect exercised by the patient’s eye, I have compiled the following table from the figures given by Dr. Culbertson,1 which, although the number of cases in which the age was not ascertained is too large to allow any very positive statements to be predicated upon them, yet illustrate the fact, familiar to practical surgeons, that, as in the case of most of the other joints, the most favorable age for excision is that of childhood and early youth, and that after the period of puberty the mortality steadily in- creases with advancing years.

There is no doubt less immediate risk attending an excision of the elbow than an amputation of the arm, on ac- count of the comparative freedom from hemorrhage in the case of the first- named operation; but the much longer period required for convalescence, after excision, not only exposes the patient necessarily during a longer time to the inroads of what are often, though improperly, called hospital diseases (erysipelas, pysemia, etc.), but gives opportunity for the development of vis- ceral diseases, especially tuberculous and amyloid degeneration, or for their aggravation if already in existence. Hence, before determining to resort to excision of the elbow, particularly in the case of an adult, the surgeon should carefully inquire into the patient’s constitutional condition, and especially into the state of the lungs, liver, and kidneys; should there be reason to suspect serious disease of any of these organs, the operation of excision would be so far contra-indicated, and, if under these circumstances any interference should be required, preference should as a rule be given to amputation. The influence exercised upon the result of elbow-joint excision by the nature of the affection for which the operation is required, is clearly shown by the following table, compiled from Dr. Culbertson’s2 figures, supplemented by those of Prof. Gurlt,3 in respect to gunshot injuries:—

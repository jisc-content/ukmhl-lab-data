317 STRUMOUS SYNOVITIS. is justly ascribed to Dumbrowski.1 The metallic thigh-ring of Thomas is retained, but, being made of steel, is capable of being opened to receive the limb, and is provided with a strap in front to secure it firmly. The apparatus is thus made: first, on the thigh and leg, and also, in disease of the ankle, Thomas’s splint for disease of the knee-joint. DnmhroTvski’s splint for disease of the knee-joint. on the foot, are moulded splints of felt, soaked in water-glass ; these entirely encircle their respective portions of the limb, only leaving a slight gap in front. Accurate measurements are taken of the length of the different limb- segments, and strips of sufficiently strong metal are cut accordingly, one for the outer and one for the inner side, reaching from the thigh-ring to the malleolus; when the knee is affected, no hinge lies opposite that joint, but one is placed at the ankle, the rods below which are united a sufficient dis- tance beneath the foot by a sufficiently broad sole plate. If, on the contrary, the ankle is the diseased joint, a hinge lies opposite the knee, but there is none corresponding to the ankle. These appliances being ready, and the water-glass splints dry, these latter are removed from the limb, and are riveted to the metals; straps are then sewn on, and the mechanism is ready for adaptation, which is effected by a fresh soakage in water-glass, and by bandaging and strapping on the limb. When all is dry, the patient is allowed to walk about; of course, at first, a couple of sticks, or even crutches, must be used for the sake of balance, but they may very soon be discarded. If the instrument have been rightly made and applied, the foot does not come to the ground; the weight falls on the sole plate beneath the foot, and is trans- ferred by the metal rods to the ischium.

Gurlt’s figures embrace 150 cases, with 51 deaths, a mortality of 34 per cent. The utility of the limb preserved by ankle-joint excision has been usually satisfactory. Culbertson tabulates1 2 177 good results out of 196, in which this point was inquired into, a proportion of more than 90 per cent. Gurlt’s table of “ end-results” in military surgery3 gives, out of 55 cases, 29 which were “good” or “very good,” 23 wdiich were “medium,” and only 3 which were really “ had.” Stauff, as quoted by Rose, gives the proportion of good results after excision of the ankle as 75 per cent. Excision of the Astragalus.—This operation appears to have been first performed in 1582, by a surgeon of Duisburg, whose case, but not whose name, is recorded by Fabricius Hildanus. The astragalus may be excised when carious or necrosed, or in cases of compound fracture or dislocation. Simple dislocations may also prove an indication for the operation, if the displaced bone cannot be replaced, and if it threaten to produce sloughing by pressure upon the integument. " Excision of the astragalus may he conveniently effected by making a semi- lunar incision on the anterior and external aspect of the joint (Fig. 749). The removal of the bone may be rendered easier by first cutting across its neck with strong pliers, and then dislodging each fragment in succession with elevator and forceps, using the probe-pointed knife in the deep parts of the wound. In some cases, however, the bone has to be removed piece-meal by means of the gouge. My personal experience in excision of the astragalus is limited to two 1 See also tables on pages 444 and 445.

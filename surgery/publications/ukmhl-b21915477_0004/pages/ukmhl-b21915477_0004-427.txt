397 HIP-DISEASE. covered with leather, and bands of webbing passed over the shoulders prevent its slipping down ; the splint must be bandaged both to the trunk and to the limb. A high-soled shoe is to be placed on the sound limb, and a pair of crutches provided, when the child is allowed to walk about. This splint has been much employed in England, and in some other parts of Europe. I have had many successful results from its use, but chiefly in early cases, or with very docile patients. It has certain marked defects. Hardly any patients can lie down in it, unless provided with a soft feather bed; defecation is difficult, and generally can only be managed with a flat bed-pan in the recumbent posture. It does not so entirely prevent motion as Mr. Thomas imagines; rotation especially is quite possible within the splint. Many patients, thoughtless or indocile, constantly manage, in spite of considerable watching, to bear a great deal of weight on the diseased limb while partially sitting on the sound buttock, or by kneeling with the well limb on a chair, and let- ting the foot of the unsound one rest on the floor. High-spirited lads, full of life and fun, are constantly, by some means or other, getting their weight on the diseased limb—not, of course, during the acute and painful stage, but afterwards—and thereby prolonging the disease. Fig. 669. . Another splint, of which, from the little experience I have as yet had with it, I think highly, combines the principle of immobility with that of takim>- the weight off the limb. It is similar to that described at page 317, with the addition of a moulded-felt portion for the ilium, to which the metal rod extends. There is no hinge opposite either hip or ankle ; but there is one at

505 EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. sen (Fig. 679), having, I confess, a strong objection to the use of sharp-pointed instruments in the neighborhood of the popliteal vessels. For making the bone-sections, I invariably employ Butcher’s saw, revers- ing the blade so as to divide the bone from below upwards. Fig. 727. Excision of the knee-joint by single transverse incision. In removing the articular extremity of the femur, it must be remembered that the internal condyle is situated lower than the external, and that hence the line of section must be parallel to that of the free surface of the condyles, and, therefore, oblique to the axis of the femoral shaft, as otherwise the natural inclination of the limb would not be preserved. As, too, the epi- physeal line is higher in front than behind, a safe rule is, that the condyles should be sawn in a plane, which, as regards the axis of the femur is oblique from behind forwards, from below upwards, and from withm outwards. The tibia should be sawn in a plane transverse to the long axis of the bone, with a slight antero-posterior obliquity to correspond with that of the section of the femoral condyles. In order to avoid interfering with the epiphyseal junction, and thus hindering the future growth of the limb, care must be taken not to remove the whole of the condyles; it is quite sufficient to take away the anterior portion—that which articulates with the tibia in the posi- tion of extension—a slice varying from half an inch to an inch in thickness, according to the size of the bone. From the tibia a still smaller portion may be removed, all that is needed here being to obtain a smooth section to be opposed to that of the femur. It is a good plan to snip off the sharp

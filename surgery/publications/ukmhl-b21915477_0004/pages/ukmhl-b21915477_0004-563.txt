533 EXCISION OF THE TOES. the carpus, may be much facilitated by previously rendering the part blood- less by Esmarch’s method, the wound after the operation being stuffed with oiled lint, and a compress and firm bandage being applied before the removal of the restraining tube. Of 57 cases of metatarsal excision tabulated by Drs. Otis and Huntington, 46 ended in recovery and 8 in death, the result in 3 being undetermined. The mortality of terminated cases was thus less than 15 per cent. Excision of the Metatarso-phalangeal Joints. — The articulations between the metatarsal bones and phalanges are seldom excised, injuries or diseases of these joints which require any operation usually demanding am- putation. Even in cases of neglected bunion, followed by caries, ablation of the whole toe and head of the metatarsal bone will, I think, commonly be found the best remedy, though complete excision of the joint has under these circumstances been successfully practised by numerous surgeons, includ- ing Kramer and the elder Pancoast, and partial excision by others, such as Hueter, Hamilton, Gay, of Buffalo, and A. Rose, who recommends the ope- ration even in cases of simple contraction (hallux valgus) without caries. If excision is to be practised, the joint, in the case of the great toe, is to be ex- posed by a longitudinal incision on the inner side of the foot (Fig. 753), and in the case of the fifth toe by a corresponding wound on the outer side. Fig. 753. Exrision of metatarso-phalangeal joint of great toe. Excision of the phalanges or inter-phalangeal joints of the toes is not a procedure that can be recommended. Should operative interference be de- manded at all, in affections of these parts, amputation should be resorted to.

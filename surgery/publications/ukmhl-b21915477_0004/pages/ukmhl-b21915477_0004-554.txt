EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. 524 1 Op. cit., p. 22. tibial shaft is removed subperiosteally by dividing it with a chain-saw, and then wrenching either end from its epiphyseal attachment with the lion-jawed forceps. The fibula may be resected with much less hesitation than the tibia, and, indeed, provided that the external malleolus is preserved, it may be entirely removed without materially impairing the usefulness of the limb. If the malleolus be lost, the foot is apt to become everted. A single longitudinal incision on the outer side of the limb, suffices to expose the bone, which is then divided with a cliain-saw, and carefully separated from its attachments, the periosteum being, if possible, preserved. In excising the upper end of the fibula (Fig. 745) there is some little risk of opening the knee-joint, which, Fig. 745. Resection of upper end of fibula. according to Lenoir, communicates with the tibio-fibular articulation once in ten times. The results of these operations, except in cases of compound fracture, are quite satisfactory. On page 447 will be found a brief reference to a case of acquired deformity of the leg which I succeeded in remedying by a resection of both bones. The following table, borrowed from Ileyfelder and Bceckel,1 shows the result in 125 cases of leg-excision for various causes:â€” Table showing Results of Excision of the Bones of the Leg for Various Conditions.

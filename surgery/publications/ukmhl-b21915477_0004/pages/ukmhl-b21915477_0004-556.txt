EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. 526 * Op. cit., p. 297. face with saw or cutting pliers, and then to apply the gouge and osteotrite to any softened or carious patches that may be found remaining. But under other circumstances the astragalus should be removed entire. The surgeon Fig. 746. Excision of the ankle-joint.

During the after-treatment of ankle- joint excision, the limb may be kept in a fracture-box, or, which I prefer, in a bracketed wire splint such as is shown in Fig. 747. The foot must be kept well supported, lest a condition of ac- quired talipes equinus result. Fig. 748 illustrates the result in a case of partial excision of the ankle for compound frac- ture and dislocation, done in my wards at the University Hospital by my assis- tant, Dr. H. R. Wharton. In two cases of chronic disease of the joint, in which I have resorted to complete excision, the patients did well as regarded their local condition, but died some months after the operation from pulmo- nary tuberculosis. The statistics of ankle-joint excision have been investigated by several wri- ters, including Spillman, Hancock, Poinsot, Grossheim, Gurlt, and Culbertson. The last-named surgeon has collected1124 cases of the operation as performed Bracketed wire-splint for after-treatment of excisions of the ankle-joint.

EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. 450 Repair after excision of the knee, or after any other excision which is fol- lowed by bony union, and repair after resection in the continuity of the long bones, is effected in the same manner as repair after compound fracture. The sawn ends of the bones undergo a retrograde metamorphosis into granu- lation-tissue, and the granulations from the approximated surfaces coalescing, osseous matter is again deposited, and in time complete synostosis results. In the case of the shoulder, hip, or elbow, though, in some few instances, a new capsule, and even a new synovial membrane, seem to have been formed, in the immense majority of cases union of the resected bone-ends is effected through the medium of strong cicatricial bands, analogous to those met with in fibrous anchylosis. A similar substance fills the gap after excisions of the short bones, such as the calcaneum and astragalus (when the operation is not done subperiosteally), and it is surprising to see, in these cases, what a firm mass fills the place of the exsected bone, and how little deformity, in many instances, results. Operation of Excision in General. Instruments Employed in Excision.—The knives required for excisions are strong scalpels and bistouries; a good form for the first-named instrument is that shown in Fig. 678, the handle being armed with a steel raspatory, which Fig. 678. Strong scalpel with raspatory, for excisions. is convenient for separating the periosteum. Another very useful knife is that shown in Fig. 679, with a probe-point, very heavy back, and limited Fig. 679.

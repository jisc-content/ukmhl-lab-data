31 CONSEQUENCES OF FRACTURE. in the vicinity of the fractured bone, which is the cause of the oedema that so commonly accompanies fracture of the leg. Through a sudden movement or muscular effort, one of the clots which have thus formed in the inferior veins, and which are not usually very adherent, may become detached, and, entering the femoral and iliac veins, and eventually reaching and obstructing one or more of the branches of the pulmonary artery, may give rise to sudden death, as in asphyxia. However, in this case the diagnosis was erro- neous, for the most careful examination of all the veins and of the pulmonary arteries failed to show the existence of any clot. The heart was absolutely empty, and the brain, minutely examined, exhibited no disease.1 Again, Hammick2 describes the case of a man with simple fracture of the leg, who was very despondent; on the third morning he “ became ill, grew very feeble, and in four hours was dead. We examined with the minutest dissec- tion every part of the body, but were not able to detect anything in the remotest degree to account for his death.” It seems not improbable that this may have been an instance of fat embolism. Thrombosis and Embolism.—These sometimes ensue upon the breaking of a bone. Southam3 has recorded two cases, one in a man aged 60, with Pott’s fracture of the fibula, in whom thrombosis appeared on the 17th day, and proved fatal, and the other in a woman aged 65, also with fracture of the fibula, who had like symptoms on the 16th day, and died. In the former case the diagnosis was verified by an autopsy. A case is reported by Tyrrell,4 in which a man aged 49, had his left leg fractured for the sixth time, the other leg having been broken once. On the twelfth day he had symptoms of cerebral disturbance, followed by partial paralysis of motion on the left side of the face and in the left arm. These symptoms were ascribed by Tyrrell to the withdrawal of his accustomed stimulus, but should rather, perhaps, be referred to embolism. Fat-embolism5 is a condition first observed as a sequence of fracture by Wagner and Zenker, in 1862. It consists essentially in the passage into the veins of liquefied fat, which is carried into the lungs, brain, and spinal cord, blocking up the capillaries of those organs. The occurrence of free oil in the blood had been pointed out by R. W. Smith, as early as 1836 ;6 and in 1856 a case was reported by Macgibbon,7 in which a woman, aged 35, affected with delirum tremens, died suddenly, the immediate symptoms having been dyspnoea, with coma and marked pallor; the autopsy disclosed fatty degeneration of the heart and other organs, and a great deal of free oil in the blood. Wagner, in 1865, Busch, in 1866, Bergmann, in 1873,8 and Czerny, in 1875,9 made important investigations on the subject, which has been further studied by Scriba.10 Flournoy, in 1878,11 showed that three conditions were needful for the development of fatty em- bolism after fractures: large openings in the veins ; free fluid fat; and a vis I Med.

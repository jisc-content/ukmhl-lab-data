Excision of the Shoulder-Joint.—Excision of the head of the humerus, or of the entire scapulo-humeral articulation, may be required in cases of de- structive inflammation of the joint, caries or necrosis, compound fracture or dislocation, or non-malignant tumor. For cases of malignant growth, in- cluding sub-periosteal sarcomata, amputation is undoubtedly preferable, as permitting more thorough extirpation of the diseased structures; but in a case of enchondroma of moderate size, or in one of central sarcoma (if it could be recognized as such), I should be strongly tempted to substitute excision, which under these circumstances would probably be no more liable to be followed by recurrence than amputation, while it would of course have the advantage of giving a chance for the preservation of a fairly useful limb. The most frequent cause for excision of the shoulder is gunshot injury, and this operation is of all excisions in military surgery that which has upon the whole given the most favorable results. This point may be illustrated by the annexed table, borrowed from Gurlt, showing the “end-results” of the various joint incisions recorded during the Franco-German War.

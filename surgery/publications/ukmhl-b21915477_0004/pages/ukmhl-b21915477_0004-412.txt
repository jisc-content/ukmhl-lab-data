382 DISEASES OF THE JOINTS. But if the original attack be more severe, causing rapid detachment of the epiphyseal head, and at the same time (as we have seen is the case) destruction Fig. 653.

Fig. 655. of the round ligament, the isolated portion of hone must of necessity perish; it lies loose in the acetabulum, where it acts as a foreign body, and sets up, or at the very least maintains, suppura- tive inflammation of a very severe char- acter. Such a history is plainly to be read in the preparation here depicted; the epiphyseal head has become de- tached, and is represented as falling out of the acetabulum, while the margin of that cavity, and the dorsum of the ilium, even as high as the crest, are studded with osteophytes which bear witness to a very violent disease. These are the modes in which mor- bus coxse commences, so very generally that any other way of beginning is quite a rarity. We will now go on to study the causes of certain conditions which the changes above described produce. As in other joints, so also here, osseous in- flammation, of whichever kind above described, brings with it neuro-muscu- lar phenomena; but the contractions have at this place very peculiar effects on the position of the limb, causing at first the symptom I shall call fixity, then lengthening, and afterwards short- ening of the thigh. The first of these is simply due to rigidity of all the mus- cles passing from pelvis to femur. The flexors, as almost always in joint-disease, are most affected; hence the thigh is, if not quite at first, at least very early, a little bent on the trunk.

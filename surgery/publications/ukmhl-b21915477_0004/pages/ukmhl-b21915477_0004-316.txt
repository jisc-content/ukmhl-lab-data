When shaped, the splint is formed as at b; but the portions must be at right angles with each other. The arm should be swung in a double sling, with counterpoise. Fig. 632. Splint for elbow. The wrist may be treated on a simple, straight, or dished, hand-splint; or, better, upon that used for wrist excision, taking care fully to support the fingers and the thumb. Fig. 633. Splint for wrist; the hand to rest on the cork addition. The knee may be treated on a MacIntyre splint, properly slung; but useful as this appliance is in simple synovitis, it is not equally commenda- ble in this more serious form of disease, partly because the structure is too hard, partly because the support is insufficient. Of late I have cured two severe cases of suppurative synovitis—the one by anchylosis, but in the other preserving a considerable amount of mobility—by means of the splint which Fig. 634. Splint for knee. some years ago I devised for the after-treatment of knee-joint excision. It consists of two metal gutters, one for the thigh and the other for the leg and foot, fastened together by two steel-wire brackets that stand well away from the back of the joint; with a round, steel rod passing from the groin to the

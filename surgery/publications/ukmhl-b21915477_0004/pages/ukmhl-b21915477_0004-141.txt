Sattertliwaite1 has proposed the substitu- tion of the rubber bandage for adhesive plaster, and the use of a horseshoe-shaped dilatable bag, to be filled with water, as an axillary pad. The exact advantages to be derived from this change do not clearly appear, and the risk of excoriation would seem to be increased. Hamilton describes his own method as follows:—2 “ The arm hanging perpendicularly beside the body, a sling is placed under the elbow and forearm, and tied over the opposite shoulder. An axillary pad, composed of cotton batting inclosed in a cloth cover, is placed well up in the axilla, and the elbow is then secured firmly to the side of the body with several turns of a roller.” In addition to the somewhat numerous American devices already spoken of, I may merely mention those of Brown,3 Chisolm,4 Palmer,5 and Bradner ;6 all of these have the advantage of simplicity, and it is claimed by their in- ventors that good results have been obtained by their use.

Professor Gordon, of Belfast, the agreement of whose views with my own has been before mentioned, describes an apparatus of his own devising, consist- ing of a breast-plate and arm-splint, connected by means of a rod—the idea being to substitute the broken bone by this rod.

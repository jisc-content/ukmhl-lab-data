DISEASES OF THE JOINTS. 428 awakes with a limb greatly swollen, the enlargement being most marked on a level with the joint, where also it is most clearly oedematous or fluctuating; the neighboring parts are more brawny, and only pit on prolonged pressure with the finger. The tumefaction, although some exceptions to this rule occur, is absolutely without pain, redness, or other inflammatory symptom ; neither is there any pyrexia.1 This condition is only transient; when it disappears it may leave the joint normal or nearly so (benign form). Or, on the contrary, when the swelling permits examination of the joint, very considerable changes may have already supervened ; and these may go on rapidly to produce the most sin- gular distortions, dislocations, or both, becoming manifest a few days after the first onset, as in the knees represented in Fig. 675, taken from Westphal. Fig. 675. Besides dislocation, spontaneous fractures occur from the slightest force, such as turning in bed, or simply while walking along the ward. A singular cha- racteristic is the almost complete immunity from pain, both at the dislocated joints and in the fractured bones. A patient described by Charcot, after an arthropathy had caused hip dislocation, used to walk some distance to her employment as a bed-maker. After a time the other hip was luxated; her legs were very movable but ill-controlled, and the joints flexible. So utterly painless were her limbs, that she used to amuse herself and the neighboring patients by floundering them about in bed. During one of these performances, the left femur was broken ; some time after, while changing her position in bed, both bones of the left forearm were fractured; fifteen months afterwards the same accident occurred to the right forearm ; and in the following month the left shoulder was dislocated by some very trivial movement. The fractures The usual quick pulse of ataxia must not.be mistaken for that of fever.

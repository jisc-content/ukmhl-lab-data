But this by no means proves that primary operations should be avoided in these cases. The patients who survive until the secondary period furnish, by the very fact of survival, selected cases which offer an exceptionally favorable prognosis. I have no doubt of the entire correctness of the opinion expressed by Dr. Otis and Dr. Hunting- ton, that “ The disastrous results attending cases of indubitable shot-fracture at the hip treated by temporization [a mortality rate of 98.8 per cent.] must induce the surgeon to desist from such an experiment, and to excise primarily rather than submit the patient to the danger of the inflammatory period.”3 The table embraces no example of primary excision of the ankle, hut that the primary period is the best for interference in cases of wound of this as of other articulations, is shown by the results of 33 cases tabulated by Dr. Otis and Dr. Huntington from the records of the American War.4 1 Die Gelenk-resectionen nach Schussverletzungen, u. s. w.

EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. 532 more bones of the tarsus, the most extensive operation of this kind in my own experience having been the successful excision, in a young child, of the scaphoid, three cuneiforms, and the base of the first metatarsal. Dr. Conner, of Cincinnati, who is the chief apostle of tarsal excisions in this country, has twice successfully removed the entire tarsus, and a third operation of the same character, also successful, has been reported by an English surgeon, Mr. H. M. Jones. No positive rules can be given for the excision of the anterior tarsal bones; the lines of incision must be decided by the position of exist- ing sinuses, care being taken of course to avoid unnecessary division of ten- dons. Dr. Conner1 has succeeded in collecting no less than 108 cases of tar- sal excision of various kinds, the gross mortality having been but a little over 10 per cent. Total number of cases, 108. Recovered, with very good uce of limb, 45, or 41.7 per cent. Recovered, with good use of limb, 23, or 21.3 per cent. Recovered, with fair use of limb, 6, or 5.5 per cent. Recovered, but with failure as regards use of limb, 10, or 9.3 per cent. Recovered, but uncertain as regards use of limb, 12, or 11.1 per cent. Result undetermined, 1, or 0.93 per cent. Died, 11, or 10.18. Of 31 cases of tarsal excision for gunshot injury, tabulated by Drs. Otis and Huntington,2 25 recovered and 5 ended fatally (16.6 per cent.), the result in one instance being undetermined. Excisions of the Metatarsal Bones.â€”The bones of the metatarsus may require excision in cases of caries or necrosis, and in some cases of compound fracture, usually as the result of gunshot injury. The lines of incision must be mainly decided by the position of existing sinuses, but it may be said generally that, for the first metatarsal (Fig. 752), the incision should be Fig. 752. 1 American Journal of the Medical Sciences, Oct. 1883. 2 Op. cit.

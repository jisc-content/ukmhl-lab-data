HIP-DISEASE. 395 they are constructed with the idea of supporting the weight of the body on the ramus and tuberosity of the ischium, while extension is made, by adhe- Fig. 665.

Davis’s splint had cer- tain mechanical defects which have been to a great extent eliminated by Dr. Sayre, who has frequently described his long and short splints. These are used as follows: To the ends of long strips of plaster (in the case of the short splint cut fan-shaped) applied to the thigh, firm webbing is sewn, which, passing under rollers at the lower end of the splint, is secured to buckles at its outside. The perineal strap is fastened firmly, but not too tightly, and then by means of a rack and key the splint is lengthened until it produces a sufficient amount of extension, being slightly longer than the part of the limb on which it fits. The object is to prevent weight falling on the joint, even though the patient stand on his foot, but to allow, and indeed to provide for motion, by placing a ball-and-socket joint at a point opposite the hip. Both these splints have been fre- quently used by myself as by other surgeons; but they have not found much favor in England, nor generally in Europe. It appears to me impossible to secure their object, namely, extension on the limb while the patient stands on his foot; the failure being due partly to slipping of the adhesive plaster on the skin, partly to the skin itself and the soft parts immediately beneath it moving over the deeper structures and the bone. After a very short time, a large portion of the weight falls, not on the perineal band, but on the hip- joint. Some modifications of Davis’s original splint, name- ly, Pancoast’s and Taylor’s, do not attempt to make Prof. Pancoast’s splint for hip* disease.

Probably the reason of this may be found in the very slight leverage afforded by the bones of the leg at this period of life, whereas the femur, which is so often broken in children, yields by reason of its slenderness. I have, however, myself repeatedly had occa- sion to treat fractures of the leg in children in private practice. It may easily be seen why the proportion of fractures of both bones should be so large. Any force applied to the part, sufficient to break one bone, will be likely to act on both; and if one of the bones gives way, the other, losing its support, will be very apt to give way also. Fracture of the leg may occur at any age, and in either sex; but the great majority of its subjects are adult males, simply because these are espe- cially exposed to the violence by which the injury is produced. Agnew says that he has twice seen intra-uterine fracture of both bones; and two other cases have been referred to elsewhere.2 On the other hand, Meachem3 has reported the case of a woman aged ninety years, who broke her leg in the lower third; union had occurred by the twenty-eighth day. For greater convenience, fractures of both bones of the leg will first be con- sidered, then those of the tibia, and lastly those of the fibula. Fractures of both bones of the leg may be produced either by direct vio- lence, as by blows, kicks, or falls—the leg striking against resisting objects— or by indirect, as when a man falls from a height, alighting on his feet, or when the foot is caught, and the impetus of the body is exerted upon the upper part of the leg. It is not always easy to explain the mechanism of these injuries with exactness, although the general principles of their produc- tion can be readily understood. The whole limb constitutes a mechanical system ; and if force be brought to bear upon it in such a way that the lever- age is through the lower part, for example, of the leg, the foot being fixed, and especially if there be any twist impressed upon the bones at the same time, the bones will give way either where the stress is greatest, or at the weakest point of their structure. Muscular action has in a very few instances been assigned as the cause of fractures in this region. Agnew4 says: “A colored man was brought into the Pennsylvania Hospital with a fracture of the tibia and fibula, four inches above the ankle, which was caused by the violent muscular effort made to recover his equilibrium after slipping upon an orange-peel. He was thirty years of age, of an excellent constitution, and without any evidence whatever of pre-existing bone-disease. He had never before had a fracture.” Gross 1 Gurlt, in his statistics, gives fractures of the malleoli separately; they numbered 32, and thus would he 11 per cent, of his 283 fractures of the leg. Middeldorpf gives 2, which would be about 3.5 per cent, of his 59 cases of fracture of the leg. 2 See p. 21. 3 Am. Med. Times, Jan. 5, 1861. 4 Op. cit., vol. i. p. 981.

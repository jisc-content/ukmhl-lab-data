60 INJURIES OF BONES. syphilitic remedies in some cases where there was suspicion of a venereal taint, I quote the foregoing statements, without comment. In the great majority of cases of delayed union, perseverance in the line of treatment now laid down will be rewarded by success. When three months have elapsed, if there is not an encouraging increase in the firmness of the union, the patient may be allowed some use of the limb, with the safeguard either of the plaster bandage or of a prothetic apparatus, such as that devised by Dr. H. H. Smith1 (Figs. 587, 588). This consists essentially of a jointed splint composed of steel bars, with padded straps to confine it to the limb. Success has also been reported2 to have been obtained by the use of tourniquets applied so as to exert slight pressure over the seat of fracture. Percussion by means of the fist or a hammer, the limb being protected by a padded leather splint, was proposed several years ae;o by Thomas, of Liverpool, and has lately been reported on favorably.3 Electricity4 5 and galvanism6 have been occasionally employed with apparent benefit. Gurlt6 speaks with commendation of the forcible tearing asunder of the uniting medium, the patient being of course placed under an anaesthetic, and the operation so performed as to involve nothing but the fibrous bands hold- ins; the fragments tosether. The modes of procedure thus far mentioned have been such as involve no wounding of the skin, which for obvious reasons it is better to avoid if possi- ble. Sometimes, however, it is expedient to use means which shall directly affect the ends of the fragments, or the intermediate tissue. Thus stimulating injections were used in 1883, by Ilulse,7 with success. Another case was re- ported by Bourguet ;8 but here a silicated apparatus was also applied, and phosphate of lime was given internally. Subcutaneous puncture, first recommended by Miller,9 has been successful in my hands, in a case of false joint in the thumb, in a child ;10 it is particularly adapted to this condition, but I have seen no other cases reported except two referred to by Hamilton.11 It consists simply in passing a narrow-bladed knife between the fragments, and scoring their ends with its edge, so as to freshen them up; in my case, I used a cataract needle. Electro-puncture is said by Azam12 to have yielded a good ultimate result, although at the ex- pense of extensive and long-continued suppuration, indicating an amount of risk to which most surgeons would hesitate to subject patients, in order to obviate a mere inconvenience. The seton was first employed by Physick in 1802, in a case of ununited fracture of the humerus,13 and for many years was by far the most efficient means of obtaining union; the list of reported cases in which it has been used would be too long to cite. It was kept in place for varying periods, from a few days to many months. Somme, of Antwerp, wishing to affect a 1 Am. Journal of the Med. Sciences, Jan. 1848.

He was treated in the field hospitals until the 12th, when lie was transferred to Washington, and admitted to Douglas Hospital. At this time lie was suffering from partial para- plegia. He died from well-marked pyaemia on the 21st, eighteen days after the casualty Fig. 797. Fig. 798. Shot fracture of the sacrum and ilium. (Spec. 1353, A. M. M.) Shot perforation of the sacrum. (Spec. 3568, A. M. M.) occurred. Autopsy The ball was found in two pieces in the sacro-ischiatic notch, having perforated the sacrum to the right of the median line, as shown in the accom- panying wood-cut (Fig. 798), which represents the osteological specimen that was ob- tained from the case, and is now preserved in the Army Medical Museum. Both lungs contained extensive pyaemic patches ; the liver and spleen were softened, and the latter enlarged. There had been icterus before death.2 Pytemia was reported as the cause of death in eight of the sixty-two fatal cases belonging to this category, or 12.9 per cent.3 The specimen represented by Fig. 799 was obtained from the corpse of a soldier, aged 41, who was wounded at Petersburg, July 30, 1864, by a conoidal ball. He was Fig. 799. Upper two-thirds of the sacrum obliquely fractured by a conoidal musket-ball. (Spec. 3586, A. M. M.) Fig.800. Right half of the sacrum grooved by a conoidal musket-ball. (Spec. 230, A. M. M.) admitted to Douglas Hospital on August 3, and died after symptoms characteristic of pyaemia on the lOlh, twelve days after the casualty occurred. For three days after

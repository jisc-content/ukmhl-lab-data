498 EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. Fig. 725. Result of excision of both hip-joints. reactionary hemorrhage occurred some hours after the operation, but was readily controlled by the ap- plication of cold and pressure; the greater part of the wound united by adhesion, but on May 4 and May 5 (the eleventh and twelfth days) there were free secondary hemorrhages, which left the patient quite blanched and exhausted. The bleeding did not recur, however, after this date, and convales- cence though slow was henceforth uninterrupted. In August, 1873, the patient was sitting up, and able to work his way along the floor by leaning upon the back of a chair. In October, he could walk pretty well with crutches. He went home in April, 1874, and in October of that year I heard from him as still improving, though still requiring artificial aid in locomotion. The photograph from which Fig. 725 is copied was obtained before he left the hospital. I have, in all, excised the hip-joint 21 times, in 20 patients, with 13 recoveries, 2 cases still under treatment, and 6 deaths, only one of which, however, appeared to have been hastened by the operation. Indeed, in two of the fatal cases, the patients may, as already mentioned, be fairly considered to have re- covered from the operation, though dying from visceral disease many months afterwards. The particulars of these 21 cases are compen- diously exhibited in the annexed table:— Table showing the Particulars of Twenty-one Cases of Excision of the Hip-joint for IIip-disease.

The statistics of hip-joint excision have been particularly studied by several authors, myself included, hut the largest number of cases yet tabulated is

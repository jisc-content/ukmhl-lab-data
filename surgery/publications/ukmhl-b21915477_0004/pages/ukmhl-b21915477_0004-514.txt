Partial excision (in military surgery) is preferred by Dominik, and his view is favored by Hueter, Langenbeck, and Gurlt, but, as far as the statistics of the late American war are concerned, the advantage is with the more sweeping operation. I am disposed, however, to acquiesce in the justice of Dr. Otis’s suggestion, that in traumatic cases, and, I may add, in some cases of necrosis —provided that the joint be fully exposed and free drainage secured—it may be sufficient to cut away the parts actually injured or diseased. In anchy- losis, also, it may suffice to excise merely the lower part of the humerus, as advised by P. II. Watson and Annandale. But in all cases of chronic disease of the articulation, and certainly in most cases of gunshot injury, complete excision may be expected to give the best results. The following table, com- piled from the statistics collected by Dr. Otis1 and Dr. Culbertson,2 gives the figures bearing upon this subject:— Table Showing Results of Partial and of Complete Excision of the Elbow.

As already mentioned, there is much more risk of anchylosis than of excessive mobility, and this is one reason for preferring, in most cases, complete to partial excision. Indeed, it may be said that, within reasonable limits, the more bone that is removed, the better is the result likely to prove. Prof. Ollier lays great stress upon the importance of preserving the perios- teum in elbow-joint excisions, with a view of obtaining reproduction of the articular extremities, and consequent restoration of function; but in many cases operated upon in the ordinary way, the limb becomes in the course of time so useful as to leave nothing to be desired in this respect. Ollier reports 36 cases operated on by the sub-periosteal method, with only 5 deaths; and in a later communication3 brings up the number to 48 cases, with not a single 1 Op. cit., Second Surgical Volume, p. 894. 2 Op. cit., p. 492. 8 Des Resections et des Amputations cliez les Tuberculeux, p. 7.

950 MALFORMATIONS AND DISEASES OF THE SPINE. an inch in height on suspension. The production of a gap of this width in the anterior part of the spinal column would be a very questionable advantage. The increase in height, under such circumstances, is due, to a great extent, to Fig. 813. Fig. 814. Suspension of patient for application of rigid jacket by Sayre’s method. Tripod for suspending patient in applying rigid jacket. the stretching of the column and unfolding of its natural curves; and it is observed in the normal spine of any individual suspended according to Sayre’s method. The object of the rigid jacket is to steady the spine, and to retain it, as nearly as possible, in the position which it assumes during extension. It aims at giving physiological rest to the part, it minimizes the effects of shocks and violent movements, and, by preventing mutual pressure and friction of the diseased surfaces, it is presumed that its use will arrest the progress of the malady and favor the process of repair. It is claimed, moreover, for the jacket, that it is inexpensive, readily applied, and composed of materials that can be anywhere obtained; and, lastly, much has been said hi favor of its simplicity, its comparative lightness, and the comfort which it affords the patient.

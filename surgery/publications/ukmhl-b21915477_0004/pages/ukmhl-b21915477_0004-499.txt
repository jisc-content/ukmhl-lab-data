EXCISION OF THE SCAPULA. 469 second category gave 11 recoveries and 3 deaths, a mortality of over 21 per cent. The results of complete are thus somewhat more successful than those of partial excision of the scapula, 206 recorded cases of which operation have given at least 49 deaths, a mortality of nearly 24 per cent. Prof. Adelmann tabulates 195 cases as examples of partial excision, from which number 4 should be deducted as cases of amputation above the shoulder, and one as a case of total excision (King). To the remaining 190 are to be added 4 from Prof. Adel- mann’s table of complete excisions (Skey, Langenbeck, Fergusson, Sydney Jones), and 12 additional cases recorded by Pean, Zimmerman, Boeckel (two), Fischer (two), Nedo- pil, Berkeley Ilill, Kurtz, Wolcott, Bellamy, and Ball, making a total of 206, as given above.

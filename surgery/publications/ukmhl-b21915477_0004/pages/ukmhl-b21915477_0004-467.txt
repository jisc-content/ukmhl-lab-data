TUMORS OF JOINTS. 437 quently occur — the bony, cartilaginous, sarcomatous, and carcinomatous growths—rarely affect the constituents proper of an articulation, save by ex- tension of disease, and even then only tardily; the synovial membrane and the cartilages are not involved, but since the tumors lie close to or over the joint, and interfere with its movements, they clinically, and to the patient actually, present themselves as joint-diseases. The important points for him and for the practical surgeon to consider, are the probability of increase, with destruc- tion of the joint, and with great incumbrance; the necessity or otherwise of removal of the tumor, or of the whole limb ; the likelihood of recurrence in loco ; and above all the probability of systemic infection.

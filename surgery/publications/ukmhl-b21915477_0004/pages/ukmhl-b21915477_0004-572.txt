EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 542 nor, by affecting the temperature, of creating any irritation, I should leave the limb at rest. In this particular I am impressed with the advantage of watching scrupulously the temperature chart; any rise in temperature indi- cates some local irritation, if not threatened suppuration; and if this con- tinues for several days together, it is, in my opinion, a sure indication of the presence of pus. In some of my later cases, very few changes of the dress- ings were required; in Case Iso. 27, of the Table, that of a young girl, the dressings were changed five times only; complete union of the soft parts was found to exist, and the antiseptics were discontinued, on the 23d day from the date of operation. The splint, however, was not removed until the thirty-fifth day. Table of Twenty-eight Cases of Excision of the Knee-joint. No. Sex and age. Condition of joint. Duration. Result. Shortening.

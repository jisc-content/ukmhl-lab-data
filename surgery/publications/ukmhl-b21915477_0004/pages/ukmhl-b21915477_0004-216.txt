INJURIES OF BONES. 186 those of fat embolism and of pyaemia. Extension is demanded in a larger proportion of cases, and by more powerful means. All the apparatus used must be on a larger scale. Arrangements must be made for the evacuation of the bowels andJ bladder, without disturbance of the broken bones. Often the risk of bedsores has to be guarded against. Yet the same general principles are to be observed—the same methods of study, the same rules as to diagnosis, and the same care for the avoidance of deformity. Fractures of the Femur. The femur, the largest bone in the body, and the most complicated in shape, is among those most frequently broken. The proportion varies in the experience of different observers, and even in the same hospital at different periods. Gurlt cites tables1 from which I derive the following statements:— Middeldorpf, among 325 fractures treated in the Allerheiligen Hospital, at Breslau, from 1849 to 1853, found 25, or something over 7 per cent, of the femur. Lonsdale, at the Middlesex Hospital, in London, between 1831 and 1837, found among 1901 fractures 181, or over 9 per cent. Gurlt, in the Hospitals and Surgical Polyclinic in Berlin, from 1851 to 1856, found 510, or less than 12 per cent, out of 4310. Blasius, in the Surgical Clinic and Polyclinic at Halle, between 1831 and 1856, found 97, or over 12 per cent, out of 778. Malgaigne, from the statistics of the Hotel-Dieu from 1806 to 1808, and from 1830 to 1837, embracing 2328 fractures, found that those of the femur were 308, or over 13 per cent. Lente, studying the records of the New York Hospital between 1839 and 1851, found that out of 1722 fractures there were 280 affecting the femur, or over 15 per cent. Matiejowsky gives from the Allgemeiner Kranlcenhaus, at Prague, from 1843 to 1855, 1086 fractures, of which those of the femur were 199, or over 18 per cent. Thus it appears that, from these seven sources, are derived results varying between 7 per cent, and 18 per cent.; a fact probably to be accounted for partly by the circumstances of the populations from which the patients were respectively drawn, and partly by the fact that, in some institutions, the general statistics are swelled by the inclusion of walking cases, while in others these are referred to dispensaries, etc. From the statistics of the Pennsylvania Hospital for eighty-seven years, from 1751 to 1838, Wallace gives, out of 1810 fractures, 291, or about 16 per cent, of the femur; while Norris, for the period of twelve years, from 1838 to 1849 inclusive, found among 1441, 195, or over 13 per cent, of the femur. This difference, although not very marked, is not easy to explain. On fhe other hand, it is readily seen why, out of the 316 cases of fracture before quoted from seven years’ records of the Children’s Hospital, in Phila- delphia, only 14, about 41 per cent, affected the femur; for by reason of the unwillingness of parents to send their children to public institutions, a large proportion of these cases are treated at their homes. This statement is singularly at variance with that of Holmes,2 that “ frac- tures of the shaft of the femur are among the commonest of all fractures in childhood;” and Gurlt’s table,3 of 1383 fractures, arranged according to age, shows, among 330 below the age of fifteen years, 60, or a little over 18 per cent., in the femur. 1 Op. cit., S. 6. 2 Surgical Treatment of Children’s Diseases, p. 258. 3 Op. cit., S. 11.

EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. 466 its periosteum—and the part then cautiously divided with a chain-saw. If the central portion of the clavicle only be involved, the chain-saw may be used on both sides, and the same instrument, or a small resection-saw, will be found convenient to sever the acromio-elavicular junction when the disease extends to that point. At the sternal end of the clavicle, disarticulation may be very cautiously effected with the knife. The hone is then drawn upwards with Fergusson’s forceps, as shown in Fig. 695, and the parts below carefully separated by using as much as possible the handle of the knife instead of its blade. Great care must be exei’cised to avoid wounding the pleura, as well as the important arteries, veins, and nerves, which lie in proximity to the bone; any vessels that are divided should be immediately secured with ligatures. Statistics of extirpation of the clavicle have been published by 0. Heyfelder, by the late Dr. Otis, and by Prof. Agnew, the last-named author having tabu- lated 34 cases, several of which, however, should be rejected as only partial excisions, while two (Nelaton’s and Richard’s, and Gunn’s cases) were extir- pations a deux temps, several months having, in each instance, intervened between the removal of the outer, and that of the inner portion of the bone. The following table, which, for the sake of convenience in reference, I have arranged alphabetically, embraces only 28 cases, all of which, however, appear to have been actual extirpations of the bone at one sitting:— Table of Total Excisions of the Clavicle.

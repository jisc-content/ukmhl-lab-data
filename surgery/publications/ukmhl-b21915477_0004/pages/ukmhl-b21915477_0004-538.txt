Bracketed wooden splint for after-treatment of excision of tlie knee. essential points to he provided for are absolute immobility of the limb and ready access to the wound, and both of these requisites are perfectly secured by using Fig. 730.

When the splint has been adjusted, the limb should be laid on a pillow, or, better still, in a large and loose fracture box. Fig. 731.

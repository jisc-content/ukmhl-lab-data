PREFACE. VI few memoranda for the proposed supplement, left by the distinguished author, were placed by his family in the Editor’s hands, but, after careful consideration, it has seemed best to leave Dr. Lidell’s article as he had completed it—a finished whole—and not to risk marring its symmetry by patching it with the work of another. Of the plates which accompany this volume, those illustrating the Microscopic Appearances of Tumors are furnished by Mr. Butlin. The remainder are from patients under the Editor’s care in the Hos- pital of the University of Pennsylvania, with the exception of that representing a Sarcoma of the Humerus and Scapula, which is from a patient seen in consultation with Drs. Massey and Price, of West Chester. JOHN ASHHURST, Jr. Philadelphia, 2000 West Delancey Place, November, 1883.

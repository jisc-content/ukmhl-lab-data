ADVERTISEMENT. 'I’liE plates illustrating tins division of the work on Surgical Anatomy have been carefully engraved from original drawings, made from my own dissections of the parts represented, with the exception of No. V, which is taken from an engraving in Scarpa’s 'frcatise on Hern ice. I have much pleasure in again acknowledging the kindness of Sir Astley Cooper, who has pennittcd me to copy the engraving representing the seminiferous ducts of the Testis, from his work on the Anatomv and Diseases of that Orijan. The other wood-engravings are from original drawings, with the exceptions of Nos. 4, 5, 9, 2, and 6, which are taken—the first three from Hesselbach, the others from Cloquet and Camper. Umver.sity College, Nov. 30, 1840. THOMAS MORTON.

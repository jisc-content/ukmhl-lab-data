G(/. cloth. “The i)lan of this work differs in one important point from other works of a similar kind. The sentences have been selected exclusively from Cresar’s Commentary on the Gallic War, instead of being taken from different authors, as has I usually been the ctise. There is an obvious advantage in this plan; the same words are con- tinually repeated by the same author in a simple narrative; and the pupil thus becomes accus- tomed to his style, and finds the work of transla- tion grow easier every day, which cannot be the c.ase when the extracts are taken from in;my dif- ferent authors, whose style must of course vary exceedingly.”—Pn/ace.

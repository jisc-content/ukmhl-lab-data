CHAPTER HI. Section I. OF INGUINAL HERNI.E. After having made ourselves familiar Avith the natural form and relative position of the several structures which compose the inguinal portion of the abdominal parictes, it should be our next object to determine Avhat are the changes from their healthy condition which are liable to be produced in them by the formation of inguinal hernise. There are two principal and leading varieties of this dis- order, the distinguishing characteristics of which are derived from a consideration of the course which the hernial tumour pursues, as it is protruded forth from the cavity of the abdo- men, and of the position which the neck or internal orifice of the sac bears relatively to the epigastric artery ; points ivliich are of considerable practical importance, since they are essen- tially different in each of the varieties alluded to. 1, External or oblique inguinal hernia.—The kind of inguinal hernia ivliich is the most frequent in its occurrence, is that form of the complaint ivhich has been named, in consequence of the hernial tumour puLsuing the same course through the inguinal canal as the spermatic cord or the round ligament of the uterus, the oblique inguinal hernia ; by some surgeons it is, also, named external, because the neck of the sac is situated upon the outer or iliac side of the epigastric artery. (Sec the Avoodcut No. 4, at page 263, figs, o, vi.) Of this form of inguinal hernia there are three different kinds, viz. the common scrotal hernia, the congenital hernia, and the encysted or infantile hernia. 2. Internal or direct inguinal hernia.—The second princi- pal variety is that in Avhich the hernial sac, instead of descend- ing through the oblique course of the inguinal canal, is pro-

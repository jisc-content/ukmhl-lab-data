RY THE TAXrS. SOS foregoing remarks is very strongly illustrated by tlic history of the cases of strangulated hernim which are continually admitted into these institutions; for it Avill be found, upon making the inquiry, that in most of them the patients have undergone, previously to their admission, several long-continued, and, fre- quently, very violent attempts to reduce the hernia by the taxis, but which have not, however, been followed by success, on account of ignorance or forgetfulness in the operator of the principles by which he should be directed in his endeavours to attain the object sought for. Before, then, proceeding to employ the taxis, care should be taken to place the patient in such a position in his bed, that all the structures connected with the formation of the inguinal canal may be relaxed to the utmost degree possible. Thus, for example, the thigh of the affected side should be raised and bent upon the pelvis, and, at the same time, rotated inwards, in order that all tension of the lower part of the abdominal parietes, depending upon the connexion between the iliac portion of the fascia lata, and the lower edge of Poupartâ€™s liga- ment, may be completely removed. Some additional benefit, in this respect, is frequently obtained by placing the opposite limb in a similar position. The shoulders and head of the patient should also be elevated as much as possible, by means of pillows introduced underneath them ; and he himself should be held engaged in conversation, with the double object of diverting his attention from the operator, whose good inten- tions he is very likely to frustrate by opposing all his efforts; and of preventing him thereby from diminishing the space of the abdominal cavity by the contraction of the diaphragm, which is necessarily attendant upon the holding of the breath. The surgeon ought, also, to be very careful to obliterate at the first, by drawing the contents of the hernial sac slightly down- wards, the angle which is formed by that part of the strangulated bowel which is immediately external to the seat of the stric- ture, with the portion of it which is embraced within its grasp; for if he should overlook this preliminary step, he is very liable to be foiled altogether in his attempt to reduce the hernia, and, on the other hand, is much more likely to injure the coats of the intestine, by rudely squeezing it against the firm resisting margins of the stricture.

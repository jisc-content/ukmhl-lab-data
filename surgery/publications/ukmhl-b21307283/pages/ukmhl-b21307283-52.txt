246 THE FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS. fascia transversalis adheres very closely to the inferior margin of the transversalis muscle, and is so intimately blended with the posterior surface of its tendon, that it is with much diffi- culty they can be separated from each other with the scalpel. The fascia transversalis is connected to the outer margin of the rectus muscle, and is regarded by some anatomists as ceasing here ; but, with a little care, it may be traced behind it as far as the linea alba, where it is continuous with the membrane of the opposite side. No. 3. The wood-engraving represents the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. The superficial fascia and the aponeurosis of the e.xternal oblique muscle have been reflected downwards upon the upper part of the thigh ; the lower portion of the internal oblique muscle has also been detached from its connec- tions to the ligament of Poupart, and thrown upon the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle. The spermatic cord and funnel-shaped sheath of the fascia transversalis have also been removed from the inguinal canal.

THE SUPERFICIAL VESSELS. 212 tlie anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and the sym- physis pubis, are named ihe superficial epigastric artery and vein; the first is a branch sent off from the common femoral artery, at a short distance below the crural arch ; and, after escap- ing through a small opening in the iliac portion of the fascia lata, ascends, in an oblique direction, upwards and inwards, towards the umbilicus, giving branches to the integuments on either side of its course, some of which anastomose with the branches of the deep or internal epigastric artery which pierce the muscular and tendinous structures forming this portion of the abdominal parietes ; the vein takes the same course as the artery after which it is named, and empties itself into the great saphena vein, as the latter is about to pass through the saphenous aperture of the fascia lata, in its course to reach the common femoral vein.* The other vessels, Avhich are seen crossing over the spermatic cord, where it emerges from the external abdominal ring, are the external or superficial pudic arteries and veins, also branches of the common femoral ar- tery and the great saphena vein; they issue from the sa- phenous opening of the fascia lata, and, after passing obliquely inwards and upwards, are distributed to the superficial invest- ments of the cord and testicle, and to the integuments of the hypogastric region. (For a representation of the course and distribution of these vessels, see Plates I. and III. of the Surgi- cal Anatomy of the Groin, &c.) The external pudic artery is generally divided in the first incisions which areâ€™made in the operation for strangulated ingui- nal hernia, and, sometimes, the vessel will bleed so smartly as to require the application of a ligature for the suppression of the hemorrhage. If the subject should be very corpulent, the superficial vessels will not at first be apparent; and, then, in such cases, it will be necessary to dissect up the external layer of the superficial fascia, which, lying upon the vessels, conceals them from our view. This is best done by carefully cutting down upon the * In cases oflong-continued distention of the abdomen, as, for example, in some instances of ascites, ovarian tumours, &c., the superficial epigastric vein is frequently greatly enlarged in its size and varicose. In a case of as- cites I have seen it as large as the little finger.

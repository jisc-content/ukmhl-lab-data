306 CHAPTER VI. OF THE OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED INGUINAL HERNI.E. The patient should be placed upon the table, or on the edge of his bed, in the recumbent position; his shoulders being well supported by pillows, with the view of relaxing, as com- pletely as possible, the abdominal muscles. The hair should be previously removed by shaving the parts. The first incision — which should comprise in its depth the skin and subjacent adipose layer — ought to be commenced well over the neck of the tumour; at the distance, perhaps, of an inch and a half from the outer angle of the external abdo- minal ring: the object, in so doing, being to render more easy of execution the future steps of the operation, and, more parti- cularly, the safe division of the stricture, which is most fre- quently seated near the superior aperture of the inguinal canal. The incisions necessary to expose the contents of the hernial sac should be made upon the centre of the front of the tumour, or rather more towards its inner than its outer side, so as more effectually to avoid the danger of injuring any of the component structures of the spermatic cord, should they hap- pen to be separated from one another in the manner described at pages 276, 277. (See also the wood-engraving No. 6.) In cases of large scrotal hernise it is unnecessary to prolong the incisions quite to the fundus of the swelling ; as, besides the greater risk which exists in such cases of injuring some of the elements of the spermatic cord, its great length could prove of no advantage to the surgeon ; and, on the other hand, would be very likely to expose the patient to the unpleasant circum- stances attendant upon making an opening into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis testis. In small hernise, however, and especially in incomplete bu- bonoceles, the external incisions should be carried over the

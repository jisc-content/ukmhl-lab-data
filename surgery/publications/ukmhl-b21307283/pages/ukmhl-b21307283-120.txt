It is done by slipping the director underneath the fascia pro- pria in the vicinity of the lower margin of the transversalis muscle, and dividing both of these structures, with any other tendinous band which may oppose the easy reduction of the contents of the hernia. This plan may also be employed with advantage when the stricture is situated at the external abdominal ring. Notwithstanding that I have seen this mode of operating tried in a great number of cases, I never saw it once succeed. t For further observations upon the treatment after the operation, and the appearances which are found after death, when a patient dies from a stran- gulated hernia, the reader is referred to the Surgical Anatomy of Femoral Hernia, pp. 149—152.

STRANGULATED INGUINAL HEUNI.E. 309 same time that its point remains steadily fixed in its position within the neck of the sac. The direction of tlie incision necessary to divide the stricture should be, in all cases of inguinal hernim, vertically upwards, parallel to the linea alba; since by so doing there can be no chance of doing any injury to the epigastric artery. A very slight cut, not exceeding, perhaps, the eighth part of an inch, will be generally found sufficient to liberate the strangulated bowel. It is of the utmost importance, during the division of the stricture, that the prolapsed intestines should be completely protected from injury by the knife; which may be done either by the fingers of the operator’s left hand being spread over them in such a manner as to prevent them from rising over the edge of the instrument; or, should he be otherwise engaged, then the same object may be fulfilled by the hand of an attentive and intelligent assistant. It is also very necessary, while endeavouring to reduce the contents of the hernia into the belly, that the sac should be firmly held by its margins ; since it has happened, in conse- <]uence of neglecting this very advisable precaution, that both it and its contents have been rudely thrust back into the abdomen together in a mass, the bowel remaining still girt by the stricture. The stricture having been divided, the contents of the hernia must be reduced with great care and gentleness ; and, if it should happen that both omentum and intestine have descended, the latter should be replaced before the former. It will facili- tate the return of the parts, if the thigh be raised and rotated inwards, as has been already recommended while treating of the taxis.*!• The operation being concluded, and the parts safely returned into the abdomen, which is to be ascertained by gently intro- ducing the point of the finger into the mouth of the hernial sac, the edges of the wound should be brought together by a few points of the interrupted suture, and the dressings supported by a thick compress and spica bandage. A copious enema may now be administered by means of the patent syringe; and if this t Vide page 300.

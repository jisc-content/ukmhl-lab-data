294 CHAPTER IV. OF THE DIAGNOSIS OF INGUINAL HERNI/E FROM SOME OF THE DISEASES WITH WHICH THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE CONFOUNDED. The diseases with which inguinal hernise are most liable to be confounded, are hydrocele, either of the tunica vaginalis, or of the spermatic cord; luematocele; varicocele; chronic abscess, having its seat in the iliac fossa; enlargement of the testicle from various causes; a suppurating inguinal gland ; and steato- matous growths upon the spennatic cord within the inguinal canal. In the female, a femoral hernia is occasionally mistaken for a rupture of the inguinal species. Hydrocele.—It occasionally occurs in practice that consider- able difficulty is experienced, even by very distinguished sur- geons, in determining the nature of the tumour of a hydro- cele ; for, when the collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis is so large as to extend for some way upwards into the inguinal canal, the swelling may have the same form as a scrotal hernia, and, like it, may be very tense and elastic, and receive an im- pulse whenever the patient is made to cough. If the contents of such an hydrocele should be opaque, then an additional source of doubt is created, and the difficulty of coming to a decisive conclusion greatly increased. But the sense of fluctuation which may generally be per- ceived on handling the tumour, its transparency when examined in the usual way with a lighted candle in a darkened room, its light weight as compared with that of a hernia, and the history of its progress, which shows that its first commencement was below, and that it gradually increased in size upwards,—-joined with the possibility of feeling a portion of the spermatic cord free, betwixt the summit of the swelling and the abdominal rings,—are signs which, when taken collectively, are quite suffi- cient, at least in the cases of hydrocele which are ordinarily met

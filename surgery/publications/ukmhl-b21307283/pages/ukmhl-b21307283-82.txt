272 oF OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA. ivitli a remarkable tliiekeneJ and contracted condition of the neck of the sac ; Avliich, so far from presenting its ordinary delicate structure, forms an unyielding band of a dense cellulo- fibrous or even a semi-cartilaginous nature, that very frequently becomes, independently of the surrounding muscles, the seat of the stricture in numerous cases of strangulated hernise. This deposition of new matter around the neck of the hernial sac is always followed by a diminution of the calibre of the mouth of the sac; and this circumstance may be satisfactorily explained by reference to the strong and firm structures which are situated around the circumference of the internal abdominal ring, and prevent its developement eccentrically, and, also, to the fact that there seems to exist in tissues of a similar nature and origin, an inherent tendency to contract the diameter of the circle, the limits of which they bound. That this morbid alteration of the peritonaeum forming the neck of the sac is of very frequent occurrence, my own obser- vation permits me to state ; and it is this condition of the parts which must ever prevent the attempt to relieve the stricture without opening the sac, in operations for strangulated inguinal and femoral herniae, from being very generally prac- ticable or successful. The thickened and constricted condition of the hernial sac, just now described, will occasionally be found to exist at va- rious other points of its extent, besides that portion of it which is included within the embrace of the internal abdominal ring, and, sometimes, they are situated even exterior to the lower apertures of the inguinal canal. These changes in the struc- ture and appearance of the peritoneal sac are chiefly dependent upon the farther protrusion of an old hernial sac, consequent uprtn the descent of an additional quantity of the visceral con- tents of the abdominal cavity.j* Of the changes which are produced in the course of the epigastric artery^ and in the extent of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, by large old-stajiding external inguinal hernice.â€”The epigastric artery is frequently observed to be very much displaced from its customary course, by large and old-standing oblique, or external inguinal herniae. In such cases, this vessel no longer runs in an oblique course from t Vide Sir Aslley Cooper on Hernia, 2d edit. Plate figs. 1 and 3.

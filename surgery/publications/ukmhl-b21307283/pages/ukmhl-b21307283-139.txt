SCROFULOUS FUNGUS OF THE TESTICLE. 339 out any very apparent existing- cause—perhaps, from the rup- ture of some of the vessels of the tunica vaginalis, -whieli, be- coming varicose, burst and pour their contents into the sac. It is, also, frequently produced by ivounding one of the vessels of the scrotum or testicle with the point of the lancet or trocar used in tapping a hydrocele ; or it may follow a blow upon the scrotum, especially when it is distended by a collection of water in the tunica vaginalis. Tn this way hydrocele is fre- quently complicated with hmmatoecle ; a combination of the two diseases that may render it necessary to lay open freely the tunica vaginalis by incision for its cure. It is sometimes exceedingly difficult to determine with cor- rectness the nature of the swelling of a hseniatocele, and to distinguish it from disease of the testicle itself; for the tu- mour in either case possesses the same figure, opacity, and Aveight ; but it Avould be right, in all cases, Avhere any doubt exists upon this point, to make an opening into the tunica vaginalis before proceeding to perform the operation of castra- tion. Hannatocele, depending upon extravasation of blood into the tunica vaginalis, rarely admits of being cured by any milder means than a free incision into the part, by which the coagu- lated blood may be removed ; after which the wound heals by the second intention. Scrofulous fungus of the testicle.—A peculiar granular pro- trusion frequently takes place after the bursting of a scrofulous abscess of the testicle, and has often been mistaken for a malignant disease of the gland, requiring its extirpation ; but the nature of the aflfection is quite simple, and is dependent upon much the same causes as a hernia cerebri, which it re- sembles in the disposition to form an exuberant growth ; — the resistance afforded by the containing membranes of the organ affected being impaired at one point by a wound or ulceration. The fungus may be removed by the application of strong caustics ; but the readiest method of curing it consists in slicing it off upon a level with the opening in the tunica albuginea, and then bringing the edges of the wound together by a slip of adhesive plaister, or, if the condition of the integument admit of it, by a few sutures.

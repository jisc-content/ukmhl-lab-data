REDUCTION OF INGUINAL HERNI/E 302 tinually occur in which an experienced surgeon is able to relieve the patient quickly and safely from a state of imminent danger, even after the most violent and long-continued attempts to effect the same object have been made in vain by others who preceded him in the treatment of the case. But it is, also, equally certain, that the chances of success from the operation which must eventually be had recourse to in all those cases where the taxis—no matter how carefully and skilfully it has been employed—hxils to achieve the return of the strangulated parts-, are greatly diminished in consequence of the violence which necessarily attends its use. Indeed, many excellent and expe- rienced surgeons have denounced, in very strong terms, the in- discriminate employment of the taxis in all cases of strangu- lated hernia; and have not hesitated to affirm that it has, upon the whole, been productive of more harm than good, and that the operation is most likely to succeed when no attempts to reduce the hernia have previously been made.*j* The principal question to be decided before proceeding to the employment of the taxis is, in the first place, to determine the exact nature of the hernia; whether it is really an inguinal rupture : and, secondly, whether it is of the external and oblique form, or of the internal and direct kind,—for in the former of these varieties the direction of the force which it is necessary to employ is essentially different from that required by the latter. The other points of importance, which remain to be con- sidered, are,—what is the period of time that has elapsed since the descent of the hernia, and the commencement of the urgent symptoms of strangulated intestine;—the degi-ee of pain and tenderness under pressure of the tumour, but more espe- cially of the belly generally;—and, also, what attempts to re- duce the hernia have been made by other surgeons, taking particularly into account their duration, and the amount of force that has been employed, and how far it is probable that these attempts were directed by so much of surgical and ana- tomical knowledge as would render any further trial of the taxis not only unnecessary, but likely rather to be hurtful than beneficial towards securing the safety of the patient.

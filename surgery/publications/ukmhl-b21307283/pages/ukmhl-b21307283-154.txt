GREGORY’S OUTLINES OF CHEMISTRY, for the use of Students. By William Gregory, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the Uni- versity of Edinburgh. Second Edition, revised and enlarged. Complete in 1 vol. foolscap 8vo, 12s. cloth. Part I.—(Inorganic Cuemistry), 5s. cloth. Part II.—(Organic Chemistry), 7s. cloth. ‘ ‘ This is beyond comparison the best introduction to Chemistry which has yet appeared. The directions lor preparing substances are usually confined to the best method, so that brevity and selcctness arc combined. The size and price of this little work, as well as its intrinsic merits, commend it to every student of Chemistry.”—Lancet.

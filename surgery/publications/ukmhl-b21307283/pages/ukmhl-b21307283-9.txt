THE SURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA. CHAPTER I. SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE STRUCTURES CONNECTED WITH THE ANATOJIY OF INGUINAL HERNI.E. As inguinal liernise are of much more frequent occurrence in men than in women, it is desirable that a male subject should be procured for this dissection ; and, where a choice can be made, a body whicli is rather thin is to be preferred to one that is corpulent, provided that the muscular system be equally well developed. Position of the subject. â€” The subject should be laid upon its back, and a large-sized block of wood placed underneath the loins ; and, in order that the abdominal parietes may be rendered as tense as possible, the inferior extremities should be rotated outwards, and the knees bent, so that the legs and feet shall rest upon their external surface. Not unfrcquently, how- ever, it happens that the muscular walls of the abdominal cavity are so flaccid that these measures prove inadequate to produce the degree of tension requisite for their easy dissection, and then it will be found very advantageous to distend the peritomcal sac; inflating it by means of a coarse blow-pipe passed through a small puncture made in the upper part of the linea alba. The air which is in this manner introduced, is to be prevented from escaping by closing the aperture with the twisted suture at the same time that r

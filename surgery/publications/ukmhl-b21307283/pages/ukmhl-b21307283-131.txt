321 THE SPERMATIC CORD. The sperviattc cord.—The structures wliich compose tlic spermatic cord have bccu already sufficiently noticed in detail in the preceding pages. They consist of the vas deferens, and the small artery that accompanies it, a branch from the vesical artery; the spermatic artery and veins, Avith several filaments from the renal plexus of the great sympathetic nerve -which accompany these vessels in their course from the loins to the testicle; and the ligamentous cord which remains after the obli- teration of the tubular process of the tunica vaginalis in the interspace betAveen the testis and the internal abdominal ring. All these are closely invested by sheaths, derived from the sub- serous cellular tissue, and the fascia transvcrsalis, opposite the internal abdominal ring. ToAvards the loAA'er part of the inguinal canal, the cremaster muscle furnishes a partial investment to the spermatic cord, covering its anterior and lateral surfaces. This muscle is sup- plied by the cremasteric branch of the epigastric artery, and by the oblique branch of the external pudic or genito-crural nerve. As the cord emerges through the external abdominal ring, it receives another covering from the external spermatic or inter- columnar fascia; and lastly, from the dartos and integuments of the scrotum, d’hese are freely supplied with blood from the external pudic and superficial perinseal vessels.

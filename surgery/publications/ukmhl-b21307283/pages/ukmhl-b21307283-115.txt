MV THE TAXIS, 305 known to possess a powerful influence in diminishing muscular tone and vascular action. When a judicious trial of the taxis fails to effect the return of the hernia, and there exist no good and sufficient grounds for believing that any benefit is likely to accrue from waiting to make any further attempt, it can be of no use to lose time in the employment of any of those local applications which are too frequently recommended to be tried in such cases; but it will be better for the interests of the patient if the operation be at once proceeded with. It not unfrequently happens, after the reduction of a stran- gulated hernia by the taxis, that a certain degree of obscure tumefaction still remains about the parts in the inguinal canal, as well as in the scrotum, and excites a doubt in the operator s mind whether the whole of the protrusion has been effectually returned; but, it should be remembered, that this appearance is very deceptive, and very probably is owing to a serous infiltration of the cellular sheath of the cord, or to an effusion of serum into the interior of the hernial sac; in either case there is no just ground for alarm or anxiety. It may not be altogether out of place to mention here, that it is only by the knowledge derived from practice, and not from descriptions, however carefully they may be given, that we are taught to estimate correctlyâ€™the exact amount of force that may be safely used in employing the taxis in different cases of strangulated hernia, and to acquire that tact which is absolutely necessary to make an adroit use of those manoeuvres which very frequently prove of essential service in our endea- vours to secure a successful result. x

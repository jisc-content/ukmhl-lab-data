CHAPTER II. OF SOME OF THE MOKE FREQUENT DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND ITS COVERINGS. Anasarca of the scrotum.—This affection, when chronic, is usually dependent upon a dropsical habit, and is generally accompanied by other signs of organic disease ; as, for example, swelling of the feet and legs, ascites, &c. It is distinguished by its indolent character, and, generally, by the absence of any inflammatory action in the parts affected: the tumour is soft and doughy, readily pitting under the pressure of the finger : its surface is regular, having a pale, glistening, and semi-trans- parent appearance. In aggravated eases, however, the shin of the scrotum is sometimes affected with an erythematous inflam- mation. The complaint usually disappears under the use of such remedies as arc generally beneficial in the treatment of the primary affection; but if much uneasiness should be expe- rienced by the patient from the excessive distension of the part, considerable relief may be procured by puncturing the swell- ing at several points with a fine needle, by which the serosity is permitted to drain off; but, under these circumstances, it is by no means a safe plan to make incisions into the scro- tum or to scarify it, as has been recommended by some, for such proceedings are apt to induce gangrene of the part, and even cause the death of the patient. Acute anasarca—dj'lf'use infammatioti.—Sometimes the scro- tum is the seat of an acute inflammation of an erysipelatous character, which is attended with excessive redness, swelling, and tension of the part. This disorder is frequently met with in persons whose constitutions have been impaired by habits of intemperance, and in these it may occasionally seem to arise without any obvious cause. On other occasions it would appear to be excited by exposure to wet and cold, or by the irritation

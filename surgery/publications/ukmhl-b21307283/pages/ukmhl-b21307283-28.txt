226 GENERAL AND SURGICAL REMARKS. Avise, the fibres of the intercoluranar fascia, Avhich, resting on the outer surface of the aponeurosis, cross its fibres at right angles, and by adhering to each as they pass over them, tend to prevent their unnatural separation, and so diminish the fre- quency of hernial protrusions in this region. The exact situation of the external abdominal ring must not be forgotten, since it forms a principal point in establishing a correct diagnosis in all difficult and obscure cases of inguinal and femoral herniee : the ring is situated immediately above the crista and spinous process of the os pubis ; its longest diameter is directed upwards and outwards, towards the an- terior superior spinous process of the ilium ; the size of the opening being limited by the inferior fibres of the intercolumnar fascia.* Through the opening projects the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament of the uterus in the female ; both of Avhich structures receive, as they emerge, a perfect tubular inA'estment from the thin membrane or fiiscia Avhich springs from the margin of the ring, and is called the spermatic fascia. The influence Avhich is exercised by the position of the in- ferior limbs upon the condition of the lower portion of the abdominal parietes, but principally upon the tendon of the ex- ternal oblique muscle, should also be examined. The iliac portion of the fascia lata of the thigh is firmly attached, in the interval betAveen the anterior superior spinous process of the' ilium and the root of the tuberosity of the os pubis, to the inferior edge of Pouparfs ligament and its reflected portion, denominated the ligament of Gimbernat; and consequently, Avhen the loAver extremity is extended and rotated outAvards, the tendon of the external oblique muscle is rendered quite tense and unyielding, and the pillars of the external abdominal ring are brought more tightly together, so that it is with some difficulty that the extremity of the finger can be insinuated into the opening; but if the thigh should be raised and bent upon the pelvis, at the same time that the knee is rotated inwards and towards the opposite side, all the tenseness of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle Avill be removed, and the columns of the external abdominal ring so much relaxed as to admit of the introduction of the finger with the greatest facility. â€¢ Tlie Surgical Anatomy of the Groin, &c. p. 137.

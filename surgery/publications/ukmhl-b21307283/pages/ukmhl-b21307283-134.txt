HYDROCELE OF THE 824 Hydrocele.â€”The form of this disease, which consists of an accumulation of serous fluid in the cavity of the tunica vagi- nalis, {hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis,) is of the most fre- quent occurrence. The complaint ordinarily commences with- out any very obvious cause, though it is highly probable that it is frequently connected with a state approaching to a chronic No. 11. The wood-engraving exhibits the cavity of a hydrocele of the tunica vagi- nalis exposed to view by an incision upon its anterior surface. a. The body of the testicle, somewhat flattened by the pressure of the effused fluid, and situated at the back part of the swelling, about two- thirds of the way downwards.

A portion of the spermatic cord, free be- twixt the upper part of the swelling and the external abdominal ring. c. d. /I The membiane of the tunica vaginalis, forming tlie parietes of the sac.

304 REDUCTION OF INGUINAL HERNIA Besides the risk of contusing and lacerating tlie coats of the prolapsed intestine, which is constantly attendant upon the violent and unskilful performance of the taxis, there is also another danger to be avoided, that of forcing back into the abdominal cavity the hernial sac along with its contents, still closely girt by the stricture, which in these cases commonly depends upon the altered and thickened state of the peritonmum, forming its neck or internal orifice. This reduction of the hernial tumour in a mass, which has been well described by the French writers upon surgery, under the term of reduction en bloc, has been frequently observed to happen in the hands of ill- educated practitioners, who arc not generally made aware of their error, until the speedy death of the patient affords an opportunity for inspecting the parts, when the sac, with its contents still strangulated, is found rolled up in the loose cel- lular tissue which lies between the muscular parietes of the iliac fossa and the peritonajum. The direction of the force which it is necessary to employ for the reduction of an incarcerated inguinal hernia by the taxis, must be varied according to the form of the rupture, whether it be of the oblique external or direct internal kind. In the first case the pressure upon the tumour should be made in the same line as the direction of the inguinal canal; that is to say, obliquely upwards and outwards, towards the centre of the space included between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the symphysis pubis ; whilst, in the latter, it should be made more directly backwards, in the course of an imaginary line drawn from the external abdominal ring towards the promontory of the sacrum. The surgeon, grasping the tumour with one hand, fixes the parts in the vicinity of the neck of the sac with the other, and seeks to return, by a gentle and moderately increasing pressure, that portion of the strangulated intestine which descended the last. Any portion of the bowel that may be thus returned is to be prevented from again descending by making compres- sion of the u})per part of the sac with one hand, while with the other a fresh hold is taken of that which still remains down. If it be thought advisable, the efforts of the surgeon to re- duce the hernia by the taxis may be assisted by general bleed- ing, the use of the hot-bath, and all such other remedies as are

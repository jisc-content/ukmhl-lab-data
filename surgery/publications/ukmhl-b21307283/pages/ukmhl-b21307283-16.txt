It will be observed, that, in the hypogastric and iliac regions, the external oblique muscle is altogether tendinous; but it does not present a perfectly continuous and unbroken surface throughout its entire extent, as, at several points, there are formed nume- rous apertures in it which serve for the transmission of the smaller branches of the deep epigastric artery Avhich anastomose with the ramifications of the superficial vessels; several filaments of the loAver dorsal and upper lumbar nerves also issue through these openings, in their course to be distributed to the cutaneous coverings of the lower part of the belly. The distribution of these nerves sufficiently explains the sensation of being ^’■tightly girdeeV^ Avhich is so commonly complained of by those patients who labour under disease and curvature of the middle portions of the vertebral column. The apertures in the tendinous aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, are sometimes found to be very much enlarged in their dimensions, and to be filled with a small mass of adi- pose substance which is frequently connected Avith the outer surface of the peritoneum, Avhich is itself noAv and then pro- truded in the form of a small pouch or sacculus. When any of the contents of the abdominal cavity escape by these openings, the name of ventral hernia is given to the disorder. The external oblique muscle arises, on each side, from the outer surface of the eight inferior ribs by as many fleshy pro- cesses, which correspond Avith, and indigitate Avith some of the costal attachments of the serratus magnus and latissimus dorsi muscles : — the posterior fibres of the muscle, Avhich are fleshy in their structure, descend, in nearly a perpendicular direction, from the false ribs, and are inserted into the anterior half of the outer labium of the crest of the ilium, Avhile the flbres from the superior ribs incline doAvnAvards and inAvards, toAvards the mesial line, and tenninatc at the outer edge of the rectus mus- * Vide The Surgical Anatomy of the Perinaeum, p. 12 and p. 69.

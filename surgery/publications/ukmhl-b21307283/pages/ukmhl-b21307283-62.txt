256 CHAPTER II. DISSECTION TO EXPOSE, BY AN INTERNAL VIEW, THE STRUC- TURE AND RELATIONS OF THE POSTERIOR WALL OF THE INGUINAL CANAL. The cavity of the abdomen should now be exposed, by making an incision through its parietes from the crest of the ilium, a little distance beyond the anterior superior spinous process, to the linea alba, near the umbilicus ; and thence in a vertical direction to the symphysis pubis, as is repre- sented in Plate IV. The small intestines should likewise be removed from the cavity of the pelvis. When these direc- tions have been executed, on holding upwards and forwards the triangular-shaped flap that has been marked out, the perito- naeum which lines the interior of the abdominal parietes of the inguinal regions, will be found to present, on each side of the mesial line, three remarkable and distinct depressions, which may be denominated the inguinal pouches ox foss(C of the peri- toneum. The deepest of these fossae is the most external of the three, and is situated on the outer or iliac side of the epigas- tric artery, and coiTesponds with the upper aperture or inlet of the inguinal canal. It is underneath this point that the sper- matic vessels and the vas deferens join with each other, as they bend over the trunk of the epigastric artery, previously to their entrance into the inguinal canal, where they constitute the sper- matic cord. If the finger be pressed pretty firmly upon the pe- ritonaeum at this situation, the membrane will readily yield under the influence of the pressure thus exerted, and may easily be protruded, in the form of a small pouch or sacculus, for some little distance upon the anterior surface of the spermatic cord, as it is resting in the upper part of the inguinal canal. In some subjects a probe or other blunt-pointed instrument will be found, if introduced into the bottom of this depression of the perito- naeum, to pass, without the slightest impediment, for a consi-

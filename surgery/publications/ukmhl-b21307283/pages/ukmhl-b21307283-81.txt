OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA. 271 immediately after it lias emerged from the external abdominal ring, or lower aperture of the inguinal eanal, and hence must always be divided by the first incisions in exposing the sac of a complete bubonocele. The superficial epigastric artery usually runs a little farther towards the anterior superior spinous pro- cess of the ilium than the commencement of the neck of the sac, and, therefore, it is very rarely injured by the knife in an operation for strangulated inguinal hernia, excepting when per- formed in cases of recent incomplete bubonocele. The peritonseum, which forms the proper sac of an inguinal hernia, is seldom found altered from its healthy structure and appearance, excepting at the neck or internal aperture of the sac. In this situation the peritomeum frequently forms a sharp angular fold, the free border of Avhich projects towards the cen- tral axis of the sac. The increased action which is induced in the vessels which nourish this portion of the peritomeum, and the adjacent subserous cellular tissue, and that part of the fascia transversalis which is immediately external to it, by the excite- ment kept up by the presence of the hernial descent, and fre- quently, also, by the means employed to maintain it reduced, is followed, after the lapse of a longer or shorter period, by the deposition of new matter around the neck of the sac, which, probably, in the first instance, is closely allied in its nature and properties to coagulable lymph, but which eventually assumes the character of condensed cellulo-fibrous tissue. The neck of the peritoneal sac is also liable to become greatly thickened, from the changes which occur in it when a hernia has been maintained reduced for a considerable period, as, for example, by the appli- cation of a well-adjusted bandage or truss ; for, in such cases, the peritonseum, where it passes through the narrow aperture of the internal ring, being no longer distended by the descent of the intestine forming the hernia, falls into loose folds, which pre- sent the appearance of the mouth of a purse, the strings of which have been drawn rather closely together. These folds of the peritonmum soon cohere to each other by their opposing sur- faces, and in this manner the neck of the sac is increased in its thickness and density, in the same ratio as the diameter of the aperture is diminished. It is by the co-operation of these several causes, that, in carefully dissecting hernia) of old standing, we so regularly meet

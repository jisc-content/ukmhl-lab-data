234 THE TRANSVERSALIS MUSCLE. transvcrsalis by some cellular tissue and branches of the internal circumflexa ilii artery. In this stage of the dissection it will be found very useful to render the fibres of the transvcrsalis as tense as possible, by drawing the linea alba towards the opposite side, and removing, at the same time that the in- ternal oblique is raised up, the layer of condensed cellular tis- sue which invests the outer surface of the muscle. When the separation of the internal oblique from the transvcrsalis has been correctly made,—which in many subjects is by no means of easy execution, as these muscles are frequently blended with each other towards their inferior margin,—the fleshy fibres of the latter will, in general, be found to cease to arise from the iliac portion of the ligament of Poupart at the distance of about an inch and a half from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium. In this situation the muscle terminates by a very clear and distinct edge, which is much curved in its outline, and is partly fleshy and partly tendinous in its structure. (See Plate III. figs, m, w, r.) Since the fleshy fibres of the internal oblique muscle continue their attachment to Poupart’s ligament for an inch, or an inch and a half, nearer to the spinous process of the os pubis than the point where the lower margin of the transversalis muscle is situated, it follows, as a neeessary consequence, that the internal abdominal ring or upper aperture of the inguinal canal, by which the spermatic cord issues from the cavity of the abdomen in its oblique descent to the scrotum and testicle, is supported by it; which circumstance must frequently prove an additional source of prevention against the formation of an oblique or external in- guinal hernia. The transversalis muscle arises from the iliac half of Poii- part’s ligament, and from the inner margin of the crest of the ilium for three-fourths of its extent: it is inserted posteriorly, by a tendinous aponeurosis, -which incloses the quadratus lumborum muscle between its laminse, to the base and apex of the trans- verse processes of the lumbar vertebrae ; anteriorly, the fleshy fibres end, at the outer edge of the rectus muscle, in a tendon, which, after passing conjointly Avith the posterior division of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique behind that muscle in the space included betAveen the ensiform cartilage and a point situ- ated about midway between the umbilicus and symphysis pubis,

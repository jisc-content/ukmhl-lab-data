297 DIAGNOSIS OF INGUINAL HEIINI.E. of the liaml, and, when examined attentively, communicates to tlie touch the sensation — as it has been very aptly desig- nated — of grasping a bundle of earth-worms. In large vari- coceles an impulse may be communicated to the tumour upon coughing; but the essential distinction between this complaint and an inguinal hernia, is drawn from the circumstance, that while the latter, when it has once been reduced, cannot rede- scend so long as the inguinal canal is maintained closed by pressure made upon it by the fingers, the former reappears even still more quickly than before; and this happens also, notwithstanding the patient keeps the recumbent position, and avoids the slightest exertion. Chronic abscess of the iliac fossa, j^soas abscess, ^c.—Some- times large deposits of pus are collected in the loose cellular tissue which abounds in the iliac fossse, and, descending through the inguinal canal, form a prominent tumour in the situation of the external abdominal ring, presenting many of the characters of an oblique inguinal hernia ; for example, such as a sudden dis- appearance of the swelling under pressure, or when the patient lays himself down in the recumbent position, and as quickly reappearing Avhen he raises himself erect, and being always accompanied by a distinct impulse upon coughing. Psoas abscesses occasionally follow the same course, and may cause the same difficulty in establishing a correct diagnosis. Pro- fessor Cooper had the kindness to show me a case of this kind, Avhich had been brought to him for his opinion, in which a truss had been previously worn by the patient for a consider- able time, under the impression that he laboured under an inguinal hernia. A careful examination into the whole history of the case, and a strict investigation of all the symptoms, will, however, rarely fail to enable us to steer clear of the error of mistaking either of these complaints for an inguinal hernia. Enlarged testicle.—If the mistake had not actually occurred, some persons might feel inclined to ridicule the idea of the possi- bility of any enlargement of the testis being ever mistaken for an inguinal hernia; but several cases of this kind have been re- corded by various writers on surgery, in which considerable difficulty was experienced in arriving at a correct diagnosis. Sir Charles Bell mentions one instance in which he saw the

255 THE INTERNAL CIRCUMFLEXA ILII. that vessel, should be prolonged too much inwards, towards the edge of the rectus muscle.* The internal circumjlexa ilii takes its origin from the outer side of the external iliac artery, at first lying in the subserous cellular tissue (see Plate IV. fig. 4) : it soon, however, pierces the fascia iliaca; and taking the same direction as Poupartâ€™s ligament, runs along its posterior aspect as far as the ante- rior superior spinous process of the ilium, near Avhich point it traverses the fibres of the transversalis muscle, and so gets between it and the internal oblique. Its branches are distri- buted to the muscles which form the lateral parietes of the abdomen, and anastomose with the branches of the lumbar and epigastric arteries. The epigastric and internal circumflexa ilii arteries are of considerable importance in carrying on the collateral circulation, after the ligature of the common femoral and external iliac arteries. *f* * Vide the Surgical Anatomy of the Groin, &c. p. 170. f Ibid. p. 171.

257 OF THE INGUINAL CANAL. dcrablc distance downwards and forwards in front of tlic sper- matic cord, or round ligament of the uterus; which circumstance is owing to the imperfect obliteration, in this situation, of the original processus vaguialis of the peritomeum. In the adult female subject a long process of a similar nature is occasionally found to exist, in front of the round ligament of the uterus, and is very well known to anatomists under the name of the canal of Niick. In some few instances, the probe may be passed, in front of the spermatic cord, through a very narrow canal, or passage, as far as the testicle ; and, in such cases, the sac of the tunica vaginalis testis still retains its primitive con- nection with the cavity of the great bag of the peritonseum; the processus vaginalis peritonsei not having been obliterated as usual, but only contracted in its original dimensions.| Situated opposite the internal abdominal ring, the external inguinal fossa of the peritonseum is — in men at least — un- doubtedly the weakest point of the abdominal parietes ; and thus it happens, that cases of the common and congenital forms of inguinal hernise are almost universally observed in individuals of the male sex. If the processus vaginalis peritonsei should remain pervious during life, the intestines may, at any time, be forced down into its cavity, so as to constitute that form of external or oblique in- guinal hernia, which has been named congenital^ from the general belief which was formerly entertained, that it could only happen at or immediately after birth, before the obliteration of this process from the serous membrane lining the abdomen, which was presumed always to take place, had been effected. ^Vhen, under such circumstances, any considerable quantity of serous fluid is collected within its cavity, a congenital hydro- cele is then said to be formed. Sometimes the processus vaginalis peritomei is not wholly obliterated, but only at several points of its extent between the testicle and the internal abdominal ring; and, then, — serous fluid collecting in the sacculi which intervene between each point where the obliteration has been effected,—a scries of small encysted hydroceles of the spermatic cord may be pro- duced. f In many of the lower animals, as, for example, the dog, the processus vaginalis peritouad remains permanently open.

Royal 12mo. 5s. cloth. “ At the time when this work was first published, the importance of establishing arithmetic in the young mind, upon reason and demonstration, was not admitted by many. The case is now altered: schools exist in which rational arithmetic is taught, and mere rules are made to do no more than their proper duty. There is no necessity to advocate a change which is actually in progress, as the works which are published every day sufficiently show. And my principal reason for alluding to the subject here is merely to warn those who want nothing but routine, that this is not the book for their purpose.”—Author’s Preface.

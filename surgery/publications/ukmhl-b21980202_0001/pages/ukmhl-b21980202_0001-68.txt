For unlefs a due degree of heat be applied and continued, ferurn be- ing merely extravafated will never pro- duce pus : Hence in afcites, and other dropfical diforders, large quantities of ferum remain in this ftate for a great length of time, without any fuppuration taking place ^ and this merely from fuch colledtions being produced without any inflammation at firfl, fo that no afliftance is afforded from any degree of preternatu- ral heat; and the natural \iQi\t of fuch parts, in which ferous colleftions ufually occur, is feldom fo confiderable as to pro- duce fuch an effedl.

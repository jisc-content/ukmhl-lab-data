38 Of the "Treatment of Chap. I. mended by Mr Goulard, in the cure of ab- fceiles, or colleiSions of completely formed pus, I muft own, that, in this ftate of the difeafe, I never thought of employing them. So that it is in the real inflamma- tory ftate of the complaint only, and while a cure by difcuflion may ftill be expedled, that fuch applications are here meant to be advifed. From the known deliterious elFedls of lead, when taken into the fyftem, an objec- tion has, by forae authors, been raifed a- gainft a free ufe of the preparations of lead, even when externally applied. That lead, in different forms, has, on be^ ing taken into the ftomach, frequently proved poifonous, there is no reafon to doubt ^ and that, in fome particular in- ftances, difagreeable fymptoms have oc-. curred, where fonae of the preparations of lead have been externally ufed, is alfo per- haps certain. That fuch bad fymptoms, however, if they were not merely accidental, pr produced by other caufes, are, at leaft in general, very rare effects of the remedy in queftion.

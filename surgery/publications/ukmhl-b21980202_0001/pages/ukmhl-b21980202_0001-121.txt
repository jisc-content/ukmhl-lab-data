^edl. IV. Of Mof'tijication. i 13 Although, for the reafons I have alrea- dy advanced, incifions may not, in gene- ral, be proper: .yet, whenever the morti- fication runs deep, fcarifications fliould be made into the difeafed parts, with a view to remove a portion of them, which, by taking off a confiderable load of putrid dead mat- ter, not only leilens the fetor, which, in fuch cafes, is always confiderable, but of- ten renders it more eafy for the found parts to throw off the remainder : When incifions, however, are employed for this purpofe, care (hould be taken that they be not carried fo deep as to injure the found parts. W^hen, by the means we have recom- mended, or by" the effeds of a natural ex- ertion of the fyftem, a flight inflamma- tion begins to arife between the difeafed and found parts, we may, in general, with fome certainty, exped: that, in due time, an entire feparation will take place: and, when a full fuppuration has fairly com- menced, there will be ftill lefs caufe to doubt of a cure being to be obtained.

Of Suppuration, 55 Sed. III. tawney hue. Serum, digefted with a few red globules, and in the fame circumftan- ces, was of the fame colour. Mr Gaberâ€™s experiments tend all to elu- cidate and corroborate the fame opinion, namely, That pure unmixed pus is form- ed only from ferum. The addition of red globules to ferum, and craflamentum digefted by itfelf, exhibited nearly the fame appearances as thofe quoted above from Sir John Pringle Fat, which is thought by many to be a principal ingre- dient in the compofition of pus, was found by Mr Gaber, when exppfed to the above mentioned trial, to exhibit no appearances of that matter ; nor were any of the fiefliy parts when digefted either with ferum or water, convertible into it. From all which, it may be concluded, that the addition of any of tbefe articles to ferum, inllead of rendering it capable of producing good pus, has always the very contrary elFed ; and that it is pure ferum alone from which pus can be ob- tained.

93 SecS. IV. Of Mortification^ As carbuncles commonly appear without any evident caufe, they are in general inoll probably owing to a fcorbutic or pu- trid Hate of the fluids; for, when putref- cency prevails in the fyftem, every in- flammatory tumor that occurs, proceeds much more readily to the mortified flate than inflammation in other circumftances ever does. This opinion of carbuncles depending upon a putrefcent flate of the fyflem, feems to be confirmed by their occurring mofl frequently as a fymptom in peflilen- tial difeafes; for, although they are fome- times met with even In this country, where the plague is now never known, yet the real carbuncle is by no means a common occurrence. In fuch inftances we eafily account for gangrene, from the predifpofition in the fyflem to putrid diforders : But in what manner is it produced by inflammation In other cafes, and where no fuch difpofition can be fuppofed to take place ? This we fball proceed to invefligate.

Se(S. IV. Of Mortification. 91 and whenever phlegmon Is In any degree conjoined with eryfipelas, as fometimes happens, It feems thereby to acquire a fi- mllar tendency, not only In being more difficult to bring to fuppuratlon than thq true phlegmon, but by going on more fre- quently to the ftate of mortification.

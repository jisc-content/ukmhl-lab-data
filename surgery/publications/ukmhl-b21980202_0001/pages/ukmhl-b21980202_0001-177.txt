Sed. II. Injlammatory l*umors. 169 The We have already obferved, that this variety of abfcefs, when the matter falls down towards the anus, may be miftaken for a common phlegmon originating in the neighbourhood of the redum. But no farther inconvenience can occur from this miftake, than that the fore, which enfues from laying it^ open, or from the matter burfting out, will not fo readily heal as when the difeafe is local: And it is probable that this is one caufe of ab- fcefles in thefe parts being in fome in- ftances fo idifficult to cure. But in the more ordinary form of the difeafe, where the matter falls down beneath Paupartâ€™s 'ligament, the tumor exhibits appearances fo fimilar to thofe of a crural hernia, that the one has often been miftaken for the other. Of this I have feen different im ftances, even where praditioners of ex- perience were deceived. This proceeds, however, from inattention y for the two difeafes may be clearly diftinguiftied from each other.

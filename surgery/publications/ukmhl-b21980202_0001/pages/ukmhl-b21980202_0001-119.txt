For thefe reafons, and from never having obferved any advantages to accrue from fcarifica- tions, I have long thought that they ought to be laid afide Theriac â€˜ * Although I was coavinced, from experience, of what 1 have advanced againft the ufe of fcarifications, as well as of the impropriety and inefficacy of very warm fti- mulating applications in mortification ; it was not with- out diffidence that I firfl; ventured to affert it, the opi- nion at that time being in a great meafure new.

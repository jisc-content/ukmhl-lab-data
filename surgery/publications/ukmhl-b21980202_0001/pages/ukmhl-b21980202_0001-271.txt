Sed. III. Indolent Tumors. 263 We fliall now, as was propofed, give a de- fcriptlon of the fcrophulous white fwelling. In this variety of the difeafe, the pain is generally more acute than in the others and, inftead of being diffufed, it is more confined to a particular fpot, moll fre- quently to the middle of the joint. In fome inftances 1 have known the patients fay, even in advanced ftages of the dif- eafe, that they could cover the whole pained part with a cr wn-piece, or lefs. The fwelling is always at firfl inconfi- derable ; infomuch that, in fome cafes, it requires attention to difcover the differ- ence between the difeafed joint and op- pofite found one. We always find, how- ever, on meafurement, that it exceeds the other from half an inch to an inch in cir- cumference. In this, as in the rheumatic white fwel- ling, the leaft degree of motion always excites pain; the joint is therefore always kept in a bent pofition, by which the flexor mufcles and tendons become ftiff and contracted.

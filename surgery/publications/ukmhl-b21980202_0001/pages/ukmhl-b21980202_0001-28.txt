20 Of the Symptoms and Chap; Thefe the middle, or towards Its mofl: depending part, gets a clear ftiining appearance, and becomes lefs painful; the different fymp- toms of fever then abate, and a fluid, up- on prefliire, is found to fludluate under- neath. In this manner inflamruation is fald to terminate in what is termed Sup- puration. But if the pain, rednefs, and tenfion of the part increafe, while the fulnefs of pulfe and other febrile fymptoms are augmented, at the fame time that there is little change in the tumor in point of fize, there is then much reafon to fufpeft that Gangrene or Mortification will enfue. Mortification firfl appears by a change of colour in the part affeded, which, from being of a bright red, comes to acquire a leaden or livid caft, while fmall veficles, containing a thin acrid ferum, are dif- perfed over its furface—-the pain abates— the pulfe links, but continues frequent— the tumor at lafl: lofes its tenfenefs—turns black and flaccid—and thus terminates in a real mortified or dead fpot.

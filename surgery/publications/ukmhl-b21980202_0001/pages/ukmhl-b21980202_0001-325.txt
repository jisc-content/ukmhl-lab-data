On the bone being laid bare, we are next to determine on the beft method of removing that part of it which forms the tumor: And this will depend upon the lize of it. When only a fmall knob, it may be taken off with the head of a tre- pan : or when too large for this, it may be removed with a common faw; and af- ter taking away any fpicules which might create irritation, the fore may be treated like wounds produced in any other man- ner. The foft parts fliould be drawn over the bone, and the edges of the fkin being laid together and fecured with adhefive plafters, a cure may poflibly be obtained by the firfl: intention. In fome cafes, in- deed, this may be prevented by fmall ex- foliations taking place from the fite of the tumor. I know, however, from expe- rience.

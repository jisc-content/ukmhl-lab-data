Warm fomentations and cataplafins are the means commonly employed for the application of heat to an inflamed part; and when regularly and frequent- ly renewed, nothing, it is probable, can more effedually anfwer the purpofe. But, in the ordinary manner in which they are applied, being renewed only once, or at moft twice, in the day, they muft frequently do* more harm than good. For as foon as the degree of heat which they at firft poflefs, is diflipated, the moifture which they keep up, with the confequent evaporation that cnfues, muft always render the part much colder

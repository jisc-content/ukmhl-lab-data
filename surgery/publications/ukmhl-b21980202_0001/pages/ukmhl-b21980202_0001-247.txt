Sed. III. Indolent "^tumors* 239 to fit y only, in whatever pofture he may be, the limb fhoulcl be fecured in the firm- eft manner by afliftants, in that pofture which admits of the body to be taken out being felt in the moft diftindl man- ner. On this being done, the furgeon fiiould endeavour to fix it with his left hand towards the upper part of the joint, after an affiftant has been defired to draw the fkin as much as pofiible upwards from the part where the incifion is intended to be made. The furgeon, with a fcalpel in his right hand, is now to make an incifion through the teguments and capfular li- gament, diredly upon the fubftance itfelf, of fuch a fize as will admit of its being eafily taken out; which will be eafieft done by the end of a blunt probe being paired beneath it. If it is found to be connefted by fmall filaments, either to the capfular ligament or cartilages of the joint, they fliould be cautioufly divided, either with a probe-pointed biftoury or fciffars, after drawing the fubftance itfelf as far out as it can be got, with fmall for- ceps.

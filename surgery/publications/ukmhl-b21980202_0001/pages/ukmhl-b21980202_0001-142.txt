134 or Chap. IL gainft the ufe of fatiirnine applications in the form of gargles, from their being fup- pofed to be of a poifooous nature. But although I have often ufed them, I never knew ail Inftance of their doing harm; and they have frequently proved highly ferviceable. In fmail quantities I believe they might be fwailowed with fafety; but we all know that gargles may be employ- ed without any part of the liquor being allowed to go over. It will often happen, however, that thefe and all other remedies will fail, either from their being applied too late, or from the inflammation being very violent. When liippuration is evidently to take place, it fliould be promoted by the external appli- cation of warm poultices to the throat, and by the patient being made to inlpire the warm fleams of milk, or of any emol- lient deco<flion, by means of the machine delineated in Plate LVII. fig. 2. When matter is fully formed, it fliould be dif- charged by an opening made into the ab- fcefs with one of the inilmments mention- ed above for fcanfying the throat. ยง 4-

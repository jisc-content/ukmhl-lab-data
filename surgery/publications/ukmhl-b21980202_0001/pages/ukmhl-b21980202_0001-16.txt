PREFACE. X additional Plates, and a General Ind^x for the former editions. With a view to illuftrate this work, and to give me an opportunity of adverting more particularly than can be done in a general fyftem, to many of the more im- portant parts of Surgery, I have, for ma- ny years paft, been occaiionally employ- ed in arranging for the prefs, narrations of fuch accidents and difeafes, in the management of which I have been per- fonally concerned, as I conceive will an- fwer this purpofe ^ and they ^ill be judged to be the more valuable, as a great proportion of all that I fhall feledl will relate to circumftances, in which I have had .occafion to adt on conililtation with ocher practitioners. Two volumes of this kind, I have reafon to think, will be ready in the qourfe of the enluing year, and they will be publilhed under the title of Consultations and Obser- vations on many of the more important Parts of Surgery. i Edinburgh, \ Dec.

Sed. II. Inflammatory humors^ 163 This quantity to be ufed daily, by drink- ing a cupful from ime to time. But the mdft effedlual courfe I hav hi- therto tried, is the application of canftic round all the edges and hardened parts of the fores, at the fame time that opium in coofiderable quantities is given inwardly. For a confiderable time, 1 trufted entirely to drellings of the emollient kind, being afraid of irritating parts already highly fenfible. In fome cafes, a faturnine oint^ ment has proved fuccefsful; and in others, the common calamine cerate has anfwered^ but for the moft part, on thofe days in which cauftic is not applied, I have found more advantage from the ufe of red pre- cipitate, than from any other remedy. In fome cafes, it is neceflary to fprinkle it over the furface of the fore, in the form of a dry powder; but in others, it proves fufficient to add it to any of the common ointments. Inftead of creating pain, it commonly removes it ^ and it feldom fails to alter the difcharge from a thin fl^arp fanies to a thick well digefted pus. Mu- L 2 Gilage

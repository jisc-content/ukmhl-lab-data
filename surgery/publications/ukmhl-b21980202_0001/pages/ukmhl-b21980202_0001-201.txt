Seel. II. Inflammatory Tumors* I93 In the treatment of fprains and contu- lions, two circumftances chiefly require attention. In the firfl: place, we fhould endeavour to prevent the twelling, as far as this can be done, and afterwards thofe remedies fhould be employed which we know to prove mofl: powerful in prevent- ing or removing inflammation. It is alleged, indeed, by fome, that the fwelling which occurs from contufions ne- ver does harm, and therefore requires no particular attention. In contufions of the cellular fubftance, or even of the mufcles, I allow that this is often the cafe 3 for to whatever extent the tumefadion may pro- ceed, the effufed fluid is in thefe parts very commonly abforbed.

In large lacerated wounds, this will, for the moft part, be impradlicable ; but In common incifed wounds, it may often be very completely effeded. It ought never to be attempted, till we are certain that all extraneous bodies that have been carried in are extraded. This being accompliflied, we may very commonly cover the wound in the capfu- lar ligament entirely, by pulling the Ikin fo far over it, that the wound in the one may not correfpond with that in the o- ther; and as the Ikin about the joints is fufiiciently lax to admit of this, it may for the moft part be eafily done. We are now to fix the fkin in fuch a manner that it may not retrad, either with futures or adhefive plafters: But in general the latter will prove fufficient, if aflifted by the application of a proper bandage ^ and they are preferable to futures, which in this fituation are apt to excite inflam- ination. After the plafters are applied, the fkin and cellular fubftance fliould be

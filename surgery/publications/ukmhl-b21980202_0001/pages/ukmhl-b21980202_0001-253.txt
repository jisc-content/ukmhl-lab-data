The term Spina Bifida is applied to thofe foft fwellings which fometitnes appear in the courfe of the fpine in new-born children, moft frequently at the inferior part of it, between the two laft vertebrae of the loins. A fludua- tion is diftindly perceived in them : And the fluid which they contain can in foine meafure be prefied in at an opening which takes place between the fpinous procefles of the two vertebrae on which they are feated. In feme cafes this open- ing is found on diOedtion to proceed from a natural deficiency of bone ; in others, from the fpinous procefles of the vertebrae being merely feparated from each other : In all of them, the tumor is produced by ferum colleded within the natural cover- ings of the fpinal marrow.

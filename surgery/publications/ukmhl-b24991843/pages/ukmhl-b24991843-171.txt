163 OF THE TUNICA VAGINALIS. I. STRANGULATED HERNIA OF TUNICA VAGIN ALTS — OPERATION— STRICTURE IN NECK OF SAC OPPOSITE INTERNAL RING—FLUID IN SAC IN UNUSUAL QUANTITY—INFLAMMATION OF SAC AND CON- TENTS—RECOVERY. John Anderson, mate of a coasting vessel, thirty years of age, was admitted to the New York Hospital on the 23d of September, 1853, under my care, with symptoms of strangulated inguinal hernia. He had never been ruptured until about two weeks before, when a tumor suddenly appeared in the right groin while he was making severe exertion. A truss was applied to it; but, going to sea after a few days, the truss broke, and he was obliged to re- turn the hernia as well as he could when it came down. About five days before admission, after ex- posure to wet and cold, he began to feel some pain in the tumor, which extended over the abdomen, and was accompanied by occasional vomiting. The belly be- came tense and tender, and from this time he had no passage from the bowels. The scrotum also was no- ticed to be gradually swelling, and he was unable to put back the rupture as before. On examination, the hernial tumor was found to be small, and it could be pushed inside of the external ring, but no farther, giving the idea that the sac and its contents were merely pushed into the inguinal canal without being properly reduced. On handling the tumor, a peculiar creaking sensation was noticed, such as would be pro- duced by the friction together of two inflamed and dry serous surfaces. The scrotal tumor was evidently a collection of fluid in the sac—which was suspected to

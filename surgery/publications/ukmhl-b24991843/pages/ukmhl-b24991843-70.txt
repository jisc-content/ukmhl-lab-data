CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. 62 masses of fibrin, which was generally quite free from coloring matter, and presented the appearance of having been deposited some time before death. On examination of the morbid parts, some days after their removal, the ligature was found upon the artery about an inch and a quarter above the origin of its epigastric and circumflex iliac branches, which occupied their normal position. The cellular invest- ment of the artery, which was disturbed only at the point of ligature, was vascular, thickened by effused fibrin, and more adherent than natural to the vessels, for some little distance above and below. A coagu- lum filled the artery from the ligature to the bifurca- tion of the primitive iliac. On the outer side of the artery, in the vicinity of the ligature, were three lymphatic glands, inflamed and enlarged to three times their natural size. Below Poupart’s ligament, over the course of the pistol ball, the tissues were found to be considerably thickened and indurated. On carefully isolating the vein, artery, and anterior crural nerve, the following appearances presented themselves: an inch and a quarter below Poupart’s ligament, and half an inch above the origin of the profunda, on the external side of the common femoral artery, and lying upon the nerve, was a true pouched aneurism, the size of a Madeira nut, communicating with the artery by a jug-like neck as large as the orifice of the pro- funda. Immediately opposite to the orifice of the aneurismal sac, was a preternatural opening in the artery, leading directly into the femoral vein. This opening was somewhat larger than the caliber of the artery. Over the abnormal communication between the femoral vessels, and involving apparently the

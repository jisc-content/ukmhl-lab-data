43 CASES OF TRACHEOTOMY. moved a cherry-pit from the trachea of a child seven years of age, under t.he influence of chloroform, in which the result was equally gratifying. These cases, which prove that anaesthetic agents may be employed with safety in operations upon the air-passages, are the more satisfactory as they serve to dispel the objections urged against their use under these circumstances by a high European authority. Professor Miller, of Edinburgh, in the last edition of his “Principles of Surgery,” under the head of “Sur- gical Experience of Chloroform,” expresses the opinion that “in the case of tracheotomy on account of a foreign body in the windpipe, anaesthesia must plainly be abstained from,” on account of “ the transcendent risk of suffocation by uneiected and accumulated blood.” Experience has thus far shown, in America, that the risk of suffocation in tracheotomy is not so great as was anticipated, and it furnishes us with good reason to hope that a more extensive observation will demonstrate the safety of the employment of chloro- form in this as in other operations. II. SYPniLITIC ULCERATION OF LARYNX—THREATENED DEATH FROM SUFFOCATION—TRACHEOTOMY—RELIEF. Andrew Wheeler, a moderately robust and healthy- looking man, thirty-three years of age, with depression of the bones of the nose, apparently from syphilitic disease, was admitted into Bellevue Hospital, in Sep-

LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 195 lowed this operation, and the dangers to be avoided in its performance, and thus by demonstrating the actual value of the operation and the cases to which it is applicable, to contribute, if possible, to a still further diminution in its mortality. Of the 86 operations, 38 were performed for true aneurisms; of these, 25 were cured and 13 died. Twelve were operated upon for traumatic aneurism; of these, 9 recovered and 3 died. Fourteen operations were performed for wounded axillary artery; of these, 7 recovered and 7 died. Five were distal operations; of these, 2 recovered and 3 died. In 3 cases operated upon, the diseasevwas mistaken; of these, 2 died and 1 survived. In 14 cases the nature of the disease is not stated, or expressed in doubtful terms. (They were all, how- ever, aneurisms or wounded arteries.) In investigating the comparative mortality after ligature of the main arterial trunk of the upper and lower extremities, I find that the result is in favor of the lower extremity, comparing the outer third of the subclavian with the external iliac; thus in 149 cases which I have collected of ligature of the external iliac arteries, 49 of them were fatal; showing a mor- tality for this operation of 32-8 per cent., or not quite 1 in 3. The mortality of ligature of the external portion of the subclavian is 38â€™3 per cent., or 1 in 2'6. If the comparison were instituted between the opera- tions on the subclavian arteries without regard to its subdivisions, and the primitive internal and external iliacs, the difference would be still greater in favor of the lower extremity. The reasons for this difference

CASES OF STRANGULATED HERNIA 168 to which it was closely attached. It was about three inches long, and narrow like the finger of a glove, reaching down to within an inch of the testicle. This sac presented on its anterior face the incision made in the operation, which incision was just below the abdominal opening of the sac. Just below this incision, the caliber of the sac became contracted and then expanded, so as to form a pouch at its lowest portion. Separating this lowest pouch of the hernial sac from the testicle, was another elongated sac, an inch in length, which reached down to the testicle. This lowest sac contained a little reddish serum. It neither communicated with the empty hernial sac above, nor with the tunica vaginalis below, but was shut off from either by a thin membrane. It seemed clear that this elongated sac was the tunica vaginalis, which was obliterated only at two points, one just at the testis, and the other one inch above. The lower segment was a hydrocele of the cord, the upper seg- ment was the sac of a congenital hernia. IV. STRANGULATED HERNIA VAGINALIS—SIMULTANEOUS OCCURRENCE OF RUPTURE AND STRANGULATION, IN THE ADULT, WITH GREAT DISTENTION OF SCROTUM—OPERATION—RECOVERY. Wm. Dennom, a Pennsylvanian, twenty years of age, driver of an express wagon, ruptured himself about the commencement of the year 1855, before which time he had been entirely free from any trouble of the kind. In a day or two, however, the rupture

CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. 58 1844, a wound from a pistol ball, which entered about an inch and a half below the ant. sup. iliac spine on the right side, and, traversing the front of the thigh in a line directed obliquely downward and inward, lodged immediately beneath the skin on the inside of the limb, about two inches below the pubes. There was a great gush of blood at the time of the accident, which was, however, readily staunched by pressure, and did not again recur; the wound healed without difficulty under ordinary treatment, the ball being removed by incision. Shortly after his recovery, a pulsating tumor was discovered just below Poupart’s ligament, over the track of the femoral vessels. Early in December, 1846, he arrived in New York to place himself under the care of Dr. Mott. At this time there was a general enlargement of the upper fourth of the thigh, with considerable induration, and over a space some three and a half inches in diameter, in the position described above, a strong aneurismal pulsation was felt, accompanied by a very distinct and peculiar purring thrill. There'was no marked promi- nence at any point constituting a distinct tumor. Pressure upon the external iliac artery arrested the pulsation and thrill in the tumor. At the point where the femoral artery enters the tendon of the adductor magnus, its pulsation could be felt perhaps more dis- tinctly than usual, but without any perceptible thrill. On the upper part of the thigh there were a number of enlarged superficial veins, and at several points below were patches of permanently distended capil- lary vessels. There was also a small ulcer on the leg of two months’ standing. Some numbness and weak-

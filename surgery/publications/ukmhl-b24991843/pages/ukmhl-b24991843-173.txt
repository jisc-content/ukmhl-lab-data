STRANGULATED HERNIA OF TUNICA VAGINALIS, OF LARGE SIZE— UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF FLUID IN THE SAO, RECOGNIZED BE- FORE OPERATION—STRICTURE AT NECK OF SAC. On the 27th of March, 1855, an intemperate Ger- man, of forty-two years of age, was admitted to the New York Hospital, under Dr. Halsted, with strangu- lated scrotal hernia of the right side. His symptoms were vomiting, prostration, cold skin, feeble pulse, and hiccough. The scrotal tumor was very large, and excessively distended. It was learned from the patient that he had been ruptured for some years, and had worn a truss, which he had left off recently while on a drinking bout. Symptoms of strangula- tion had come on about ten hours before his admis- sion to the hospital, after a debauch. On examining the tumor by transmitted light, translucency could be distinctly recognized. After full etherization, the taxis was employed unsuccessfully, and the operation performed. On incision of the sac, about half a pint of fluid resembling that of hydrocele escaped, and about four or five feet of dark-colored intestine were found in the tunica vaginalis. The stricture was di- vided, and the gut returned. The patient died in about forty-eight hours, exhausted, with low muttering delirium. No post-mortem examination could be obtained.

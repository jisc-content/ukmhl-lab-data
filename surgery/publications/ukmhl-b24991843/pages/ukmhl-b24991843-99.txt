91 FIBROUS TUMOR OF THE LEFT OVARIUM. alba ten inches in length, and cut carefully clown to the peritoneum, tying or twisting all the vessels that gave blood, in order that as little as possible should escape into its cavity. This incision, after opening the peritoneum, and slitting it upward and down- ward with a probe-pointed bistoury to the full ex- tent of the external wound, I was obliged to pro- long fully two inches, before the tumor, with some effort, could be forced through it. At this moment we recognized with regret that the omentum was ad- herent to the superior surface of the tumor, over a space as large as the open hand. This was quickly detached, the scalpel being carried as closely as possi- ble to the periphery of the tumor; three vessels of the omentum required ligatures, of which both ends were cut off close to the knot, and the remaining portions returned to take their chance in the cavity of the peritoneum. The omentum detached, we turned to the pedicle of the tumor, and found to our gratifica- tion that it was slender, as was anticipated, consisting ^n fact of the left broad ligament of the uterus, sin- gularly elongated and attenuated. This I proceeded to detach from the tumor, still cutting close to its sur- face, and tying five arteries of considerable size as they were divided. The cut surface on the tumor left by the division of this solitary attachment to the uterus measured a half inch by two and a half inches. The tumor being thus removed, its pedicle, some six inches in length, with five ligatures attached near to its fimbriated extremity, and containing, palpably, the fallopian tube in its substance, was left protruding through the wound. This it was proposed to include, at its middle, in a solitary ligature, removing the dis-

DISEASES OF TIIE RECTUM. 110 sore to the mechanical violence of compression and bruising, by which it is at the same time prevented from healing and rendered so exquisitely painful. It must also be remembered, as shown by Todd and Bowman and Brown-Sequard, that the fibers of a muscle, when stimulated to action, either by the will directly, or indirectly by reflex irritation, do not con- tract simultaneously and then relax altogether; but that each separate fasciculus or bundle of ultimate fibers—the aggregate of which make up the muscle— contracts and relaxes by itself, each, to a certain de- gree, independently of its neighbor; and thus, like the keys of a piano under the fingers of a rapid per- former, all these separate fasciculi, as long as the stimulating cause continues, are playing in succession upon the painful ulcer. The pain thus produced varies both in degree and in duration. It may be slight and transient, or it may be almost insupportable in severity, and last eight or ten hours. The act of defecation itself is often accompanied by a slight degree only of sore- ness, and there is generally an interval of ease after defecation, before the peculiar pain of the disease sets in, and this interval is longer if the stool be solid in consistence. If this view be correct as to the cause of the pain in this disease, it follows that any means by which the contractile power of the sphincter is interrupted or temporarily abolished will relieve it at once. Its division by the knife illustrates the lact. !Now, it is well known that forcible stretching of muscular tis- sue will temporarily impair its contractility. The paralysis of the bladder, which so often follows its

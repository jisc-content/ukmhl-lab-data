92 FIBROUS TUMOR OF THE LEFT OVARIUM. tal portion, and dividing carefully the peritoneum on the uterine side of the ligature, in order to avoid strangulation,—thus substituting one ligature for five. This was accordingly done, and the fimbriated ex- tremity of the fallopian tube, together with the point of attachment of the tumor to the broad ligament, was cut away. In the portion remaining there was no trace of an ovary. We took the liberty of examin- ing into the condition of the right ovary, and the fundus of the uterus, both of which felt and looked as they should, nor was there any further trace of morbid growth to be discovered.

Strips of adhesive plaster were accurately applied in the intervals, and the solitary ligature from the peritoneal cavity was brought out at thef lower angle of the wound. A little scraped lint along the incision, a longitudinal compress, and a carefully applied bandage around the abdomen completed the dressing. After changing some portions of her dress, our patient was carried to her bedroom, and was left, with but one attendant near her, in perfect quiet, until consciousness should return. At this time her pulse was 75 in the minute, and natural in quality. During the operation, and while we were separating the omentum from the tumor, some mouthfuls of green- ish watery fluid were ejected by the stomach, and a slight effort at vomiting was noticed once or twice

The patient was accordingly etherized at once, and as we could make no impression upon the tumor, he was at once conveyed to the operating theater, about three oâ€™clock p.m. On opening the sac, the testis was found as was anticipated, and also about ten inches of small intestine, intensely con- gested, and embraced very tightly by the borders of the external ring. After this source of constriction had been relieved by incision, the gut was found still to be irreducible from stricture evidently situated higher up in the inguinal canal. By enlarging the incision already made in the tendon of the external oblique, in such a manner as to expose the interior of the canal, and by making gentle traction upon the sac and intestine, I succeeded in bringing into view the internal ring, encircling the neck of the sac and its contents as tightly as I have ever seen a femoral hernia strangulated. The neck of the sac and this tight ring surrounding it were then incised, in effect- ing which not a little care was required; and the bowel could then be drawn down and examined, and afterward readily returned into its proper cavity. The patient recovered without a bad symptom, and was fitted with a truss, and discharged cured in about three weeks.

The patient, already under the influence of chloro- form, being placed on his back upon a table, with the but- tocks projecting beyond its edge, the limb to be removed is committed to an assistant previously instructed as to its management,â€”the other limb to a second assistant, who carries it with the scrotum and penis as far as possible to the opposite side, and who also steadies the pelvis; the external iliac artery is then, at the word, forcibly compressed against the horizontal ramus of the pubes by the principal assistant; and the surgeon, standing on the outer side of the limb, transfixes it with a straight narrow knife, ten inches long, enter- ing its point about an inch above the great trochanter, grazing the head or neck of the femur, if possible, as it passes in front of it, and, pushing it through the integuments near the anus at a point diametrically opposite to its entrance, cuts out an anterior flap in the usual method, at least six inches in length. Mean- while the principal assistant, passing one hand into the wound behind the knife, grasps the flap, and with it the artery before it has been divided, and as soon as the division is completed, with both hands carries the flap upward as forcibly as possible.

192 LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. external portion of the trunk of the subclavian. For the cure of these forms of disease, in this situation, we must hope that some ingenious modification of the successfully revived treatment by compression may hereafter succeed better than the operation of John Hunter, which in other parts of the body has been the means of saving so many lives. In 1819, Baron Dupuytren, at the Hotel Dieu of Paris, in a case of very large aneurism following a wound of the axilla, where the external portion of the subclavian was inaccessible from the extent of the tumor, cut across the scalenus anticus muscle near its origin, with a probe-pointed bistoury, and applied his ligature to the artery behind this muscle, or, as it is called, in the middle part of its course, and he had the satisfaction of curing his patient. This same locality was selected by Auchinloss, in Scotland, for the application of the ligature in a similar case, in 1833; but his patient died comatose in sixty-eight hours. Our countryman, Dr. J. C. Warren, repeated the operation again with success in 1843. The danger of injury to the phrenic nerve is the greatest obstacle to the repetition of this opera- tion, and this is a possible source of danger, as will be seen from a case to be mentioned hereafter. Avoid- ing this danger, however, which seems within the bounds of possibility, this operation appears to de- serve more attention than it has received, consider- ing the success which has followed it so far. As far back as the year 1800, the English army surgeon Keate cured a case of spontaneous axillary aneurism in a young man of twenty-five, by tying what was then called the subclavian artery, below

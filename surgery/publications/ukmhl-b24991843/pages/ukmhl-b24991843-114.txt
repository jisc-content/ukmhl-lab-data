106 DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. scious has proved of immense assistance; but, in order to effect the object thoroughly, it is necessary, after the full influence of the anaesthetic has been produced, to place the patient in a particular posi- tion, as well as to secure the best possible light. The position which I have found most advantageous is that employed by our colleague, Dr. Marion Sims, in his very successful operations upon the vagina and neck of the uterus, the superiority of which he first recognized and pointed out, as detailed in his paper on “Silver Sutures.” The patient is placed with the upper part of the trunk in a prone position, the front of the thorax in contact with the bed or table, the head on its left side, the left arm brought out at the left side and carried behind the back, the pelvis on its left side, with the thighs flexed at a right angle, and the but- tocks exposed toward the light and elevated suffi- ciently to permit the abdominal viscera to gravitate toward the diaphragm. These details may seem un- necessarily minute, but those who have witnessed the operations of Dr. Sims will bear witness that they are easily carried out in practice, and that the position secures great advantages to the operator by permit- ting the air to enter and freely expand the vagina, thus relieved from the pressure of superincumbent organs. In exploration of the rectum, the same ad- vantages are obtained as soon as the sphincter ani is dilated by the introduction of the speculum. The speculum I employ is a modification of that used for the vagina by Dr. Sims; the modifications consisting in the notch at its angle intended to receive the sphincter muscle, and thus to resist the tendency of

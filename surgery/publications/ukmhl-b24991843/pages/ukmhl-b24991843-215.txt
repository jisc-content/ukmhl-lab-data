207 SALIVARY FISTULA. through the mucous membrane of the mouth into its cavity, the two points of perforation being about half an inch distant from each other; and, by careful traction, the disk of skin containing the fistulous orifice was brought as nearly as possible into contact with the outer surface of the mucous membrane of the mouth, at the bottom of the deep wound at the anterior edge of the masseter. The extremities of the double wire were then twisted tightly together until their loop, including the half inch of mucous mem- brane and the disk of skin from the cheek, was so small as to keep these parts as closely approximated as possible, without too much tension either of duct or mucous membrane. These twisted ends of the double wire were left about three inches long, and brought out at the corner of the mouth, where they caused but trifling inconvenience, and came away spontaneously in the fifth week after the operation. The edges of the elliptical wound of the cheek were then brought together by means of ten sutures of fine silver wire, applied by Dr. Emmet, to whose skill at this stage of the operation Dr. Van Buren mainly at- tributes its ultimate success. Collodion was applied over the sutures, and the patient fed upon beef-tea. Very considerable inflammation occurred during the ten days succeeding the operation, in which the paro- tid gland was involved, and several abscesses followed each other for more than six weeks, through which saliva escaped for a day or two at a time, but the sil- ver seton in the mouth kept a channel open in that direction, and the wound in the cheek finally healed firmly and soundly. Some of the anterior fibers of the masseter muscle were divided, in order to dimin-

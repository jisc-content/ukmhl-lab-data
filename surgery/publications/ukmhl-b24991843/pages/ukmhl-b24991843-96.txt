88 FIBROUS TUMOR OF THE LEFT OVARIUM. uterine apparatus was both long and slender. When the uterus was restored to its normal position, the lower edge of the tumor was distinctly felt from the vagina, and its probable connection with the left ovary recognized. This was confirmed by the origin of the tumor in the left iliac region, and by the result of a rectal examination in the upright position, by which means a knobbed projection from the tumor was dis- tinguished, which was supposed to be the left ovary. After this somewhat thorough examination, I in- formed my patient and her mother of the nature of the protrusion from the genitals; that it depended upon the weight and growth of the tumor of the ab- domen, and could not be remedied with any certainty while the tumor remained in the belly; that there were no medical means capable of removing the tumor, but that such tumors had been removed by a surgical operation, which, however, was attended with imminent danger to life. She immediately testi- fied her willingness to incur any risk which was ac- companied by a prospect of relief. I then explained to both parties, as clearly as I was able, the probable course of the disease, and the amount of risk to life involved in the operation, and requested them to con- sider the subject maturely, and to inform me at the end of a week of their conclusion; meantime, at my request, the patient was examined by my father-in- law, Professor Mott, and by my excellent friends, Prof. Parker, Drs. J. P. Batchelder, Metcalfe, Markoe, and V. Mott, Jr., who all concurred in the opinion that, owing to the extreme mobility of the tumor, and its apparently slender connection with the uterus or its appendages, the case was a peculiarly favorable

DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. 119 injection of tepid flaxseed tea with a Davidsonâ€™s tube, to secure soft stools. At the end of a week I was in- formed that my operation had relieved the severe pain, and that he was ready to have his tumors re- moved. I explored his rectum the next day under ether, and found, in addition to the haemorrhoids, not less than three ulcers, not very unhealthy in appear- ance, and situated between the tumors. I applied the ligature to four tumors, and finished by dilating the sphincter a second time.

He had a daily stool without pain, protrusion, or loss of blood, and was exceedingly grateful for the result. I might continue to relate cases in which forcible dilatation of the sphincter ani has been employed with results not differing from those already stated, but fear to tire your patience. The cases I have de- scribed embrace most of the prominent points in con- nection with the operation which my experience furnishes. I will only add that I have acquired great confidence in its efficiency as a substitute for the knife, and that its simplicity and the facility with which it is effected, together with its wide range of application as a prompt remedy in a common and very painful class of diseases, appear to me to justify its more general adoption as an established operation of sur- gery. This operation was originally proposed by Rccamier, of Paris, but I have been unable to find any record of its employment by his immediate successors. Some

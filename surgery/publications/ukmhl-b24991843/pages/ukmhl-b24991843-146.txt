In short, he insisted so strongly that at least the lithotrite should be tried, that a fortnight after the first sounding I introduced a crushing instrument of medium size. I had scarcely moved the instrument in search of the calculus, when the bladder contracted spasmodically upon its contents; the warm water that I had in- jected was forced out of the urethra, alongside of the instrument, and the pain which followed was so great that it was at once withdrawn. Some in- creased irritation followed this experiment. My patient not being yet satisfied, the lithotrite was again introduced some three weeks later, while he was under the influence of chloroform. There was much less difficulty experienced on this occasion, and 1 was able to get a very good idea of the shape and size of the calculus, which I seized between the jaws of the instrument; but fearing the increase of trouble that might follow from the presence of sharp and angular fragments, it was abandoned unbroken. So much irritation succeeded this application, that I positively declined any further attempts at lithot- rity in his case; and, after some delay, during which Dr. Mott saw him with me, and confirmed the neces- sity of a cutting operation, he finally consented to submit to it. lie was now suffering excessively, and his urine was constantly loaded with blood and mucusâ€”the mucus looking very much as if it was mingled with pus, although the microscope did not confirm the presence of the latter. He was placed upon the use of the decoction of the pareira brava, with alkalies, for several weeks longer; but as there

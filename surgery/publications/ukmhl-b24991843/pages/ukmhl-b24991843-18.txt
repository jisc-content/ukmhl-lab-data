10 AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT fully effected after the previous removal of a portion of the limb below, the present case will assist in de- monstrating the greater safety of the operation under these circumstances.* The unusual size and apparent tendency to repro- duction in the bony growth, which rendered the oper- ation necessary, are also features of interest in the case; while the method adopted in the disarticulation of the thigh, it is believed, has not been hitherto described. Elijah Vanderhoof, a native of New Jersey, of moderately good constitution, forty-three years of age, and the father of a family, came under my care in the month of May, 1848, with an immense tumor in- volving the lower half of the femur of the left side. About twenty years before, he had wrenched his left knee in wrestling, in consequence of which he was confined to the house for a few days; and some three months after this accident he first noticed an enlargement about the knee-joint, which had, since this period, continued slowly to increase in size, the tumor extending gradually up the thigh. At the time of my first examination the tumor in- volved the whole circumference of the limb, extend- ing from the knee-joint upward as far as the middle of the femur; it was immovably connected with the bone, and measured twenty-eight inches in circumfer- * There are three cases on record besides the present, in which amputatiou at the hip-joint has been done after a previous amputation in the same limb above the knee, viz.: that of Astlcy Cooper, in 1S24, (Lond. Lancet, vol. ii. p. 96, 1824;) Mayo, in 1841, {Gyc. Prac. Sur- gery, part ii. p. 182;) Sands Cox, in 1844, {Memoir, etc., Lond., 1845.) All have been successful.

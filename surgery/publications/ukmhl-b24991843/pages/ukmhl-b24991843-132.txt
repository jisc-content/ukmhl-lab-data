LITHOTOMY IN AN ADULT—HEMORRHAGE KEPT UP AFTER OPERA- TION, BY VOMITING FOLLOWING USE OF CHLOROFORM, AND RECUR- RING AT A LATER PERIOD FROM A DIFFERENT CAUSE. In the month of January, 1851,1 removed a calculus of moderate dimensions, and consisting mainly of the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate, from the bladder of Mr. J. A., of Patterson, N.

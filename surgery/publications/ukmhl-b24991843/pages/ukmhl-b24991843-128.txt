DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. 120 fifteen years ago I saw in the Gazette cles Hopitaux, of Paris, a proposition on the part of Maisonneuve to cure fissure of the anus by introducing the hand into the rectum, closing it firmly, and then withdrawing the closed fist by main force. This mode of operating met with no favor, although Maisonneuve states that he employed it successfully. Shortly after this I was told by my friend Professor Metcalfe, of this city, that he had stretched the sphincter ani in painful condi- tions of the anus with benefit. Sedillot, in his Operative Surgery, published in Paris in 1855, speaks of forced dilatation as a remedy for fissure of the anus, and describes an operative pro- cess, but gives no results. Nelaton, of Paris, also alludes to it in highly favorable terms as worthy of trial since the discovery of anaesthesia, but gives no experience. I have heard of its employment in this city by Dr. Gurdon Buck, Dr. John Burke, of East Broadway, Dr. Isaac Cummings, and others. On the other hand, I can find no allusion to it in any of the English works on Diseases of the Rectum.

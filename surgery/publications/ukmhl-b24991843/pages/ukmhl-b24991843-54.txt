CASES OF TRACHEOTOMY. 46 side of the wound. The patient was doing admirably; since the operation his pulse had not exceeded 90, the amount and character of the expectoration re- maining about the same. On the twelfth day, the tube having been changed meanwhile, as occasion re- quired, I removed it for the purpose of exploring the interior of the larynx through the wound. On the posterior surface of the windpipe, just above the wound, I discovered with the probe a portion of bone, which had become almost detached from its connec- tions, and was on the point of falling into the trachea, when I caught and removed it with the forceps. It was about the size and shape of one of the ossa nasi, and evidently a portion of the posterior part of the ossified and necrosed cricoid cartilage. This then was evidence of the nature of the disease of the laryngeal cartilages, and accounted for the odor of diseased bone and the discoloration of the silver tube. Other ossified points were also detected by the probe, which was passed up through the glottis into the throat. On stopping the external orifice of the tube with the finger, after it was replaced, he could, for the first time since the operation, force air through the glottis, and made an audible noise in so doing. For some time after this date, Wheelerâ€™s condition continued to be very comfortable; constitutional treat- ment was employed for the syphilitic disease of the larynx, from which he seemed to derive benefit; his appetite was good, and his general health improved. His respiration remained free, but he was much annoyed by the viscid expectoration by which the tube was frequently obstructed. This was changed and cleaned daily, being immediately replaced on removal by a duplicate tube of the same size.

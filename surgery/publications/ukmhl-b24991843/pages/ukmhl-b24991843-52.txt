CASES OF TRACHEOTOMY. 44 tember, 1848, complaining of sore-throat, with great difficulty of breathing, and complete aphonia. On first entering the ward in which the patient had been placed, I was struck by the peculiarity of his breathing, and on examining into his symptoms I was soon convinced that he was in imminent danger of death from suffocation. As far as could be learned, under circumstances so unfavorable for an accurate diagnosis, his sore-tliroat was of some monthsâ€™ dura- tion, but the serious obstruction to the breathing had existed only about three weeks, and had been gradu- ally increasing, with occasional paroxysmal exacerba- tions, and for the last two nights he had been able to get no sleep whatever. Expiration as well as inspira- tion was accompanied by a whistling sound, as of air passing through a very narrow opening, and it was effected with much exertion, as in a paroxysm of asthma. His expectoration was copious in quantity, and accompanied with very considerable choking and strangling; it consisted of tough, thick, yellowish masses, occasionally streaked with blood, and partly sinking in water. His breath exhaled a gangrenous odor, in which that of dead bone was very evident. Pressure of the thyroid cartilage caused pain. On passing the finger back into the fauces, ulceration and partial destruction of the epiglottis was readily recognized. On auscultation, the respiratory murmur could be heard throughout the chest, but more obscurely than natural. The resonance of the chest was normal. After a partial consultation, it was decided to try the effect of an emetic, and in case it failed to afford relief, to have immediate recourse to the operation ot tracheotomy.

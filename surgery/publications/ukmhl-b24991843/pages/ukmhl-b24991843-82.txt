CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. 74 the third by compression, after repeated hemorrhages. In the upper extremity gangrene occurred twice, and in a third instance (10) the condition of the limb approached so nearly to gangrene that amputation was performed. In the instance in which the com- mon carotid was tied, the disease was ultimately cured by the operation of Kiesler. In the 12 cases of the disease seated in the lower extremity, the external iliac artery was tied, pri- marily, five times, and gangrene followed in all. The common femoral was tied twice; gangrene followed in both. The femoral artery was tied five times; gangrene followed in two of these cases, and hemor- rhage in all. In one instance (14) the external iliac was tied for hemorrhage following the ligature of the femoral, without preventing a fatal result. In fact, the only cases in which death did not follow the operation in the lower extremity are those of Bayn- liarn, whose patient survived after a very serious secondary hemorrhage, and Lawrence, who had re- course to amputation during the progress of the gan- grene. The hemorrhage in these cases is due, beyond a doubt, to the altered condition of the arteries conse- quent upon the disease, and this is a circumstance which has not received the degree of attention which its importance demands. It furnishes an additional argument against the Hunterian operation in this dis- ease, and is calculated to interfere materially with the success of any operative process undertaken for its cure. It occurred in 7 out of the 22 cases in- cluded in the table; and in 5 it was more or less directly the cause of death.

196 LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. will be seen hereafter in connection with the causes ol mortality, but the fact is evident that the operation of tying one of the subclavian arteries on the outside of the scaleni muscles is more dangerous to life than a similar operation upon the external iliac. Period of separation of the ligature.—The earliest date at which the ligature came away was in Manec’s case, on the 9th day, and the latest in Dr. J. M. War- ren’s, where it remained until the 96th day. The fact of the separation of the ligature is noted in 49 cases out of 86; in the greatest number it occurred on the 16th day: of the remainder it took place on the 10th day in 1; on the 11th in 3; on the 12th in 5; on the 13th in 3; on the 14th in 2; on the 15th in 3; on the 17th in 5; on the 18th, 19th, and 20th, each 2; 21st, 4; 23d, 1; 27th, 1; 31st, 2; 47th, 1; and 85th, 1. Causes of death.—In the 33 fatal cases, death oc- curred in 12 from secondary hemorrhage, in 6 from gangrene; 4 from inflammation within the cavity of the chest; 3 from exhaustion from suppuration of the aneurismal sac; 1 from constitutional irritation from sloughing of sac; 1 from hospital gangrene; 1 from dyspnoea, its cause not stated; 1 from irritation caused by inflammation of phrenic nerve; 1 from ex- haustion from repeated hemorrhages from original wound, and from repeated operations; 1 from ence- phaloid tumor of axilla; 2 from causes which were doubtful, or not stated. From this abstract it appears that the danger most to be dreaded after ligature of the external portion of the subclavian is hemorrhage, and this has arisen, in the fatal cases above recorded, from several sources.

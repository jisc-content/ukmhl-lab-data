64 CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. ural. The vessels were otherwise normal. The an- terior crural nerve was thickened, enlarged, and closely adherent to the larger aneurismal tumor. It is proper to mention that, before the operation, Dr. Mott ex- pressed the opinion that a communication probably existed between the artery and vein. The occurrence of arterio-venous aneurism in the upper part of the thigh is rather rare. Hennen men- tions a case following the wound of a musket ball, and Hodgson an instance in which it was produced by a thrust from a red-hot poker; the remaining eight or ten cases on record were caused by punc- tured wounds by a cutting instrument. It is a question of pathological interest as to the manner in which the disease was produced by the wound of the pistol ball. I cannot think that the artery was opened by the ball at the time of the wound, although the vein apparently was. From the evidence of the patient it could not be ascer- tained that the blood lost at the time of the acci- dent was arterial in its character; from the readiness with which it was arrested by simple pressure, it would seem to have been entirely venous. A por- tion of the wall of the artery, as well as of the vein, was, most probably, deprived of life by the ball in its passage; and, on the separation of the slough, the arterial current forced a passage into the vein. There was no hemorrhage, either exter- nally or into the cellular tissue of the limb at this time; and the external wound shortly healed. The arterial coats had, however, undergone so much alteration that in a little time they yielded, and the formation of the true aneurism was the

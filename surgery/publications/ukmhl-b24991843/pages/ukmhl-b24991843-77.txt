69 CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. aneurism, the alternate exchange of contents carried on between the artery and vein through the unnatural opening, by means of which a portion of the venous blood is carried again to the limb by the artery, and an equal amount of arterial blood is returned unused to the heart, by the vein. The limb, thus habitually deprived of a portion of its arterial supply, loses pro- portionally its size, strength, temperature, and sensi- bility; and moreover, according to our author, its arteries below the seat of the disease invariably un- dergo alteration—becoming larger in their caliber, thinner in their walls, and much more tortuous in their course, thus resembling veins. Premising these facts, which are considered as demonstrated, if in this condition of the limb its main artery is tied between the disease and the heart, the arteries below the dis- ease, from their changed condition, being unable to contract upon the diminished quantity of blood con- veyed into them through the collateral channels, the circulation is not carried on, and the vitality of the limb, already lessened, is entirely annihilated. Thus it appears that Breschet attributes the gan- grene solely to the altered condition of the arteries of the limb below the seat of the disease. Now, this change in the arteries, although it un- doubtedly exists, as in the cases reported by Breschet, is not admitted by some authors to be of uniform oc- currence,—in fact in the present case it was by no means well marked. It seems to me that, in addition to this explanation, there is another circumstance to be taken into account, which is not altogether without its importance. According to Breschet’s evidence, when a communication exists between an artery and

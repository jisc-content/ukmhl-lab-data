CASES OF DISLOCATION OF THE FEMUR. 157 III. FRACTURE OF BOTH BONES OF LEG AND OF TARSAL BONES OF LEFT LIMB—DISLOCATION OF RIGHT FEMUR VERY FAR BACK IN THE ISCHIATIC NOTCH, WITH UNUSUAL FEATURES—REID’S METHOD TRIED WITHOUT SUCCESS—REDUCTION EFFECTED BY THE COM- POUND PULLEYS. Patrick Dooley, a robust Irish laborer, twenty-one years of age, received the above injuries by the run- ning off the track of a train of railroad cars on the 23d August, 1855. He was brought to the New York Hospital about two hours after the accident, and re- action being already well established, the fractured limb was put up temporarily in carved splints, and the patient placed under the influence of sulphuric ether, in order that the dislocation might be thor- oughly examined and its reduction attempted. The attitude of the dislocated limb was the same after as before etherization. It was shortened about an inch; the foot and leg were slightly everted. This eversion, it was afterward ascertained, could be readily increased by manipulation; but there was an evident obstacle at the hip to inversion of the foot. The knee was slightly flexed, so that the width of the hand could be readily passed between its popliteal aspect and the surface of the bed. The obliquity of the fe- mur toward its fellow was very slightly increased. Upon the front of the thigh at its upper third, a very manifest concavity or sinking in was noticeable, the usual anterior convexity of the limb being lost. The trochanter was about an inch and a half behind and above its usual position, and, during etherization, it was quite movable on attempting rotation of the limb.

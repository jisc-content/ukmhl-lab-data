CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. 61 On the 21st, at one o’clock p.m., patient comatose. Heart’s action very weak and intermitting; no pulse at wrist. Hands and feet cold. The limb was in a state of complete sphacelus up to the wound, which was dry, black, and gaping. He died on the 22d, at four o’clock A.M., the sixth day from the operation. Autopsy at ten o’clock A.m. The whole surface of the body presented a very marked yellow tint. The wound of the belly formed the limit of the sphacela- tion above. I prolonged it four or five inches either way, and, carefully breaking down the fibrinous ad- hesions, which had already acquired some firmness, raised the abdominal parietes from the peritoneum, and exposed this membrane. For a space of three inches around the wound it presented marks of in- flammation, viz., increased vascularity, and an irregu- lar coating of fibrin on its surface; on opening its cavity, it was found elsewhere to be perfectly healthy. Through the wound thus made, I divided the aorta and vena cava just above their bifurcation, and de- taching them from the psoas muscle and the internal iliac, I cut through the crural arch, and, tracing the vessels into the sphacelated mass below, removed a portion sufficiently large to include all the disease, which was placed immediately in spirits to harden for further examination. The other viscera examined, as well as the great vessels, were healthy, with the exception of the heart. It was somewhat enlarged; the walls of the left ventricle were one-third thicker than natural, and the columns carnese presented a yellowish appearance at their termination in the chordae tendinese. The mitral valve was slightly con- tracted. All the four cavities of the heart contained

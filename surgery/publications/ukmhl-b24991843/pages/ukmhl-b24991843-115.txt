DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. 107 the instrument to slip out when the muscle is put upon the stretch, and the alteration of the handle, which is so shaped as to clear the buttock when it is swept around, so as to bring all sides of the cavity of the gut into view. To facilitate still further this lat- ter manoeuvre, and to protect the stretched mucous membrane from abrasion, the edges of the blade are carefully rounded and turned inward. The speculum being introduced and the sphincter put upon the stretch with one hand, the other hand is used to draw away the parts on the opposite side of the orifice; and, the handle of the instrument being then gradually swept around, the light falls successively upon all sides of the exposed and ex- panded cavity. By the use of this manipulation applied to a patient in the position just described, I have frequently obtained a satisfactory view of the whole extent of the cavity of the rectum as high as its upper curve. The next point to which I would ask your atten- tion is the treatment of fissure, or, as the disease is more properly named, irritable ulcer of the rectum. Fissure of the anus, or laceration of the mucous membrane of the rectum just within the anal orifice, is, I suspect, an accident of frequent occurrence, and it is almost invariably produced at stool by the effort of straining to extrude a mass of hardened feces. Most simple fissures thus produced probably heal at once, and give rise to no subsequent trouble; but when the subject of the accident is in a disordered condition of system, or when the costiveness persists, and the passage of hardened stools is of constant re- currence, the fissure is prevented from healing, and

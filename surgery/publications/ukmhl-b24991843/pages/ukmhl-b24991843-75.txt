CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. 67 Mott prefers the Hunterian operation, except in recent cases, and in the least serious form of aneuris- mal varix. (Velpeaus Oper. Surg., Am. ed., vol. ii. pp. 292-3.) Dupuytren decides that, “although reason would induce us to employ the operation of Anel in this disease, experience has demonstrated its inefficiency.” (Legons Or ales, t. 3e, p. 145, 2e ed.) Breschet (sur les Anevrysmes, Mem. de VAcad., t. 3e) reports two cases in which he employed the simple ligature of the artery without success; and also two cases with a similar result operated upon by Dupuy- tren, one of which terminated in gangrene. He ex- presses the following opinion: “La ligature du tronc arteriel, d’apres la methode de J.

Facts and Obs., vol. iv. p. Ill, give a decidedly unfavorable opinion with regard to the Hunterian operation. S. Cooper, Surg. Diet., loc. citat., and Velpeau, Med. Oper., Paris, 1839, t. 2e, p. 186, express themselves with much hesitation as to its pro- priety. A more recent writer, Rodrigues, Obs., etc. sur Xanev. variqueux, Gaz. des Hop., Jan. 1841, thinks that if accompanied by compression, applied to the

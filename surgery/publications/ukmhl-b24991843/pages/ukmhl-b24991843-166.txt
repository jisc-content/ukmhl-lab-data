158 CASES OF DISLOCATION OF THE FEMUR. Finally, the head of the femur could be felt obscurely but pretty certainly rotating in the ischiatic notch, low down, and in contact with its posterior margin. The anterior convexity of the spine at the loins was also very much increased, so that under ether more than the width of the hand could be passed between it and the surface of the bed. Thus the case presented all the classical features of luxation into the ischiatic notch, and more than usu- ally well marked, with the exception of adduction of the lower end of the femur and inversion of the foot. Reduction by Reidâ€™s method was now attempted by my colleague, Dr. Ilalsted, and myself, but without success; the manoeuvre was repeated systematically, carefully, and perseveringly, at least seven or eight times. The head of the bone would always appar- ently approximate the brim of the acetabulum during abduction; but when the limb was carried downward into the extended position, it could be sensibly felt slipping back again into its false bed. These move- ments of the head of the femur were always associated with a sensation of albuminous crepitus; there was a great deal of this, and it very closely resembled the crepitus of broken bone. We next proceeded to apply the pulleys, and made extension, as usual, in the direction assumed by the luxated bone. When the head of the bone had been drawn downward and forward, considerably beyond the acetabulum, as was evident from the position of the great trochanter, and after the limb had been ro- tated as freely as possible while thus forcibly ex- tended, the hands were applied behind the head and trochanter to oppose their return to the notch, and

57 CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. A case is recorded in the Lond. Med. Gaz., 1845, in which Mr. Luke succeeded by the same means in curing his patient; and a similar instance of success was obtained by Mr. McCoy, of Dublin. (Dub. Med. Press, vol. ix.) These cases, which are of course exceptional, de- serve, nevertheless, to be borne in mind, in connection with those treated by compression during the last cen- tury by Guattini. They serve to exemplify the value of a resource which, although rendered comparatively unnecessary by the brilliant operation of Abernethy, might prove, under certain circumstances, of immense utility to the surgeon. The following case, which, by the kindness of Dr. Mott, I am permitted to record, presents points of more decided interest in the unusual nature of the disease and its melancholy termination, and especially in connection with the important question of surgical practice which it involves. II. ARTERIO-VENOUS ANEURISM NEAR THE GROIN—LIGATURE OF EX- TERNAL ILIAC ARTERY—DEATH FROM GANGRENE. Mr. II. C. 0., of Barbour County, Alabama, twenty- one years of age, of slight build, and previous good health, received in an affray in the month of July, vessels, Lond., 1847, p. 249) to be the first on record, in which the ex- ternal iliac has been tied for aneurism of this vessel. The case of out countryman Dr. Jameson, of Baltimore, (vide Philad. Med. Recorder, 1822, vol. v. p. 118,) has the precedence by twenty years. 5

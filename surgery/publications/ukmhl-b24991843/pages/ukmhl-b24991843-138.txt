The description which the patient gave of his symptoms, although rather vague and unsatisfactory, was not inconsistent with this idea; and I was consequently surprised, on introduc- ing a full-sized steel instrument, which passed readily into his bladder, to find it in contact at once with a calculous mass, evidently of considerable size.* When Mr. , with the information which I afforded him, had arrived at a full comprehension of his situation in the new aspect which his disease had assumed, he expressed so strong a desire to be sub- jected to the crushing operation rather than to li- thotomy, that I concluded, after due consideration, to accede to his wish. His bladder was healthy, bearing the presence of an instrument in its cavity without any evidences of unnatural sensibility; his urine, on examination, was found to be normal, containing no appreciable amount of mucus; his urethra, although at first irritable, was found to be capacious and man- ageable; in fact, the only objection to lithotrity con- sisted in the large size of the calculus. The lithotrite was accordingly employed at an early day; and the first time the stone was caught, its large size was demonstrated, as the scale near the handle of the instrument indicated (in centimetres) a diameter of twro inches, less one line. The operation wras managed in the usual manner; no anaesthetic was employed, and he was instructed * The usual symptoms of stone in the bladder were singularly absent in this case; in fact, the presence of the calculus did not seem to have produced the ordinary amount of irritation in the bladder; nor did he seem ever to have suffered the tormenting symptoms so characteristic of this disease.

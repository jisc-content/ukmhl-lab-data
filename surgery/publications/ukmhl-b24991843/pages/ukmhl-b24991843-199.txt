LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 191 cent case on record, that of Mr. Partridge, whose patient died on the fourth day, with “general febrile and inflammatory symptoms.” The subclavian artery has been tied but once within the scaleni muscles on the left side, and this operation was designed and executed in this city, in the year 1846, by the late Dr. John Kearny Rodgers. Pre- vious to this case, operators had been deterred from attempting its ligature on account of the greater depth of the artery on the left side, and its more important relations, especially by the vicinity of the thoracic duct. Dr. Rodgers’s patient died also, from hemorrhage, on the fifteenth day. For anatomical reasons, which it would be foreign to our purpose to discuss at present, it is to be feared that the ligature of the subclavian artery in this part of its course, which has in every instance, thus far, proved fatal, will never be followed by a different re- sult. I have, nevertheless, heard Dr. Rodgers express the opinion that he would feel justified in attempting his operation again, with the addition of passing a ligature at the same time around the vertebral artery near its origin, with the view of obviating distal hem- orrhage. The value of this suggestion remains to be proved. It is to be remembered that Liston, in one of his operations on the right shoulder, adopted the suggestion of Mr. Quain with the same object, and tied the carotid near its origin, as well as the subcla- vian; but on the eleventh day hemorrhage came on as usual, and on the thirteenth day the patient died. This operation has been been done in six instances for true aneurism, and in the two others for aneurism following a wound involving to a variable extent the

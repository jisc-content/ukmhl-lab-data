160 CASES OF DISLOCATION OF THE FEMUR. flanimation, and the joint capable of its natural mo- tions, with but a trifling amount of stiffness. The patient recovered well from the fracture of his left leg, and was discharged cured on the 23d October, with perfect use of both limbs. I should be disposed to attribute the absence of the usual amount of adduction of the limb and inversion of the foot, in this case of dislocation, to the probable laceration, to a greater or less degree, of the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and obturator externus mus- cles, or their tendons. The great trochanter not be- ing drawn forward and kept in contact with the dor- sum ilii, as it usually is in the backward dislocations of the femur by the tension of these muscles, was carried outward and backward by the weight of the limb into a moderate degree of external rotation. This laceration of muscles is rendered more proba- ble by the distance—greater than usual, and the di- rection almost horizontally backward—of the head of the bone from the acetabulum. The rapid and entire recovery from these injuries is no doubt mainly owing to their subcutaneous char- acter. It is also worthy of remark in this case, that the patient was under the influence of ether more than three hours without any observable ill effects.

CASES OF TRACHEOTOMY. 49 robust, had been attacked on the Sunday morning previous with symptoms of croup, for which he had been appropriately treated, and it was not until Mon- day evening that his breathing became permanently affected, and his condition was considered alarming.

I found him weaker, but with no additional symptoms,

27 BY A MODIFIED PROCESS. delay as possible,* and the patient removed to his bed, where, if his condition allow, he should be left entirely undisturbed to recover from the influence of the chloroform. I employed the operation thus described in the case of my patienf, and I may truly say that there was not a circumstance occurred in its progress that I could wish to have happened differently. Indeed, with such assistance as I enjoyed, it could not have been otherwise. I will add a few words with regard to what I be- lieve to be the advantages of this mode of operating. It is nothing more than a modification of Liston’s operation with antero-posterior flaps, in which the posterior flap is made by cutting from without inward toward the bone, instead of in the opposite direction, the disarticulation of the thigh being left to the last. The disarticulation of the head of the bone, and the detachment of the great trochanter from its nu- merous connections, is confessedly the most difficult part of the operation ordinarily, and that most liable to cause delay. In the operation by lateral flaps, cutting around the great trochanter, whether effected in making the first flap as by Lisfranc’s method, or in the last, as by that of Larrey, is a clumsy process in the most skillful hands. The descriptions of these opera- tions read smoothly enough in the books, but they are far more difficult in execution. * “ I considei’ the success of the operation to depend very much upon the quickness with which it is performed, (not only on account of hemorrhage, but) to avoid the shock the constitution receives from the continued exposure and iri’itation of so large a surface in the immediate vicinity of the trunk of the body.” [Guthrie.)

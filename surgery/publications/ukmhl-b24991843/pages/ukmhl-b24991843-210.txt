202 LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. with a case of ligature of the subclavian which had just been reported, that he had once performed this operation upon a thin male, and that immediately on tightening the ligature, the patient was seized with a constant and continued short cough, which went on until he died. On examination, the phrenic nerve was found to be uninjured, but highly inflamed, as well as its neurilemma. In one of Mr. Symes’s cases, in which the subclavian was tied for a rupture of the axillary artery, hemor- rhage still persisting from an incision made in the axilla, for the purpose of exploration, amputation was performed at the shoulder-joint, and the patient ulti- mately got well. In Mr. Mackenzie’s fatal case, reported in a recent number of the Edinburgh Monthly Journal, on ex- amination no aneurismal sac was found, but the artery opened directly into the cavity of a large abscess be- low the clavicle, thus forming a peculiar variety of aneurism, as he thinks, which was first described by Liston, in connection with the primitive carotid. In an operation by Manec, already referred to, (re- ported in the Gazette des Hopitaux, 1849,) air entered the external jugular vein, which was necessarily di- vided, producing convulsions and syncope, but the patient recovered. In the fatal case of the French surgeon Gal tie, re- ported by Delpech, the head of the humerus being shattered by a gunshot wound, was exsected; hospital gangrene attacked the wound, and the limb was re- moved at the shoulder-joint; the gangrene returned in the stump, and having involved the artery, hemor- rhage took place, for which the subclavian was tied.

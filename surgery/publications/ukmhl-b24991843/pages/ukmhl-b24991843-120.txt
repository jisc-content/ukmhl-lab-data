112 DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. assumes a healthy appearance and rapidly heals, the pain ceasing entirely from the time of the operation. Case.—A gentleman of forty-five was under my care for chronic phthisis in 1861, and, through change of diet and habits and removal to the country, im- proved very much in health. Early in the present year he came to the city for relief, having relapsed for several months in consequence of suffering severe “ agonizing” pain after going to stool, which had led him to neglect the calls of nature. His appetite was gone, and he was losing flesh. The present trouble had its origin in costiveness. He had no great pain at the time of defecation, but about half an hour after- ward an indescribable smarting, stinging, and boring pain would come on, and last for three or four hours. I suspected the cause of his trouble, and the next day, with the assistance of Dr. Foster Swift, had him etherized, and explored his rectum. On its coccygeal aspect, just within the verge of the anus, we saw an unhealthy-looking ulcer, about the size of the finger- nail, with elevated edges and a dirty, yellowish sur- face. I stretched the anus with the thumbs, in the manner above described, and ordered a dessert-spoon- ful of castor oil at bedtime. The operation was fol- lowed by no pain, and the next morning he had a stool without pain—“just the slightest possible feel- ing of soreness”—as he described it, and much to his gratification there was none of the “agony" afterward. It has never returned; and with proper care he has regained a very fair condition of health. He was confined to the house one single day.

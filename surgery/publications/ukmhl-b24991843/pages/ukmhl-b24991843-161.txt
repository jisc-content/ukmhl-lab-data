CASES OF DISLOCATION OF THE FEMUR. 153 I. DISLOCATION OP FEMUR INTO FORAMEN OVALEâ€”REDUCTION, DURING PROFOUND ETHERIZATION, BY DIRECT MANIPULATION. Martin West, a healthy German sailor, thirty-four years of age, was working in the hold of a ship, on the 23d of July, when he was struck by a bale of cot- ton weighing four hundred pounds, which fell through the hatchway upon him, a distance of some ten feet. The cotton bale struck him first upon the right shoulder and then upon the outer side of the upper part of the thigh, knocking him down and falling upon him. He was brought immediately to the New York Hospital. On examination, about an hour and a half after admission, the following appearances pre- sented themselves: While lying upon his back in bed, the right thigh is slightly flexed and very strongly abducted; it cannot be approximated to the median line or brought in contact with its fellow of the opposite side. On measurement from the antero- superior spinous process of the ilium to the lower margin of the patella, an elongation of three-quarters of an inch is recognized. Viewed from behind, the right buttock is considerably elongated and narrowed, and the transverse depression between buttock and thigh obliterated. The prominence of the great tro- chanter has disappeared, but it can be felt on a line parallel with the tuberosity of the ischium, and very far back.

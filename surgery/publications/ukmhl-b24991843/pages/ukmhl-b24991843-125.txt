DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. 117 This remedial measure has a wider application than to the treatment of irritable ulcer of the rectum. In inflamed hmmorrhoidal tumors, or any painful inflam- matory affections of the anus, where the spasmodic contractions of the sphincter constitute the principal source of the pain and obstruction to the circulation, the stretching of the sphincter, with or without the intervention of an anaesthetic, will afford prompt and certain relief. It is equally applicable to the affection described by some authors as “spasm,” and by others as “painful contraction” of the sphincter,* * and also in the “neuralgia of the anus” of nervous subjects and hysterical women. I have been in the habit for several years past of employing this manoeuvre after the operation for the cure of hhemorrhoidal tumors, whether by ligature or the use of the ecraseur. The result has been always favorable. The patient is saved entirely from the severe pain, generally lasting several days, which is caused by the pinching of the tender and inflamed parts by the spasmodic contractions of the irritable sphincter. By throwing it out of play, the suffering amined the part with a Sims speculum. In front of the coccyx there was a vertical, oblong sore about three-quarters of an inch in length and half an inch in breadth, covered with healthy granulations. I did not see him again for several weeks, at the end of which time examination showed that the sore had entirely healed and the mucous membrane was in a state of perfect integrity. I have seen him a number of times during this year, (1863,) and he has had no sign of relapse. * Boyer, Trait6 des Maladies Chirurgicales, etc., 4th edition, tome x. pp. 139-150.

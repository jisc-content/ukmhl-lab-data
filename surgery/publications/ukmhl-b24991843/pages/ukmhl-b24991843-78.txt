70 CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. a vein, a portion of the arterial current passes into the vein at each systole of the heart, and during its diastole a counter-current of venous blood overflows into the artery. Now, when the arterial current is arrested by a ligature, the systolic impulse conveyed through the devious collateral channels is barely perceptible, if it exist at all, by the time that the blood has reached the main trunk below the ligature, and there- fore, the current through the vein not being inter- rupted, we may readily infer that it would overflow into the artery through the abnormal opening more freely than before, as it meets with no opposing cur- rent from the artery. Thus the arterial blood received by the limb through its anastomosing arteries, already perhaps deficient in quantity, and degenerated in character,* is still further depraved by constant and free admixture with the effete venous blood of the limb. Hence I would infer that, in the present case, the circumstance of the abnormal communication was probably the principal cause of the gangrene. Prof. Horner suggests (Am. Journ. Med. Sci., Jan. 1841) that the arterial blood brought into the limb under these circumstances finds its way back to the heart so much more readily through the unnatural opening, than by its ordinary route through the capillaries, that it is thus deprived of a sufficient arterial supply. Thus far for the manner in which gangrene is * The dark color and continuous flow of the blood in hemorrhage from the distal extremity of a wounded artery demonstrate that it has already lost some of the qualities of arterial blood, and that it is certainly not as well able to support the vitality of a limb as that received directly from the heart.

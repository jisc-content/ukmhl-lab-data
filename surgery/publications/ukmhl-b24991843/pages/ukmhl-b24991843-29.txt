BY A MODIFIED PROCESS. 21 excited thereby in the surrounding tissues, and never to the tissue of the tumor itself. This conclusion ac- cords entirely with the anatomical fact that nervous filaments have never yet been detected in the sub- stance of these heterologous growths. Hence I would offer the conclusion that the pain experienced by my patient, which seemed solely to account for the de- terioration of his health, in no way invalidates the diagnosis as to its natureâ€”although the disease did return after its removal. And I presume that this conclusion will be confirmed on examination of the reproduced disease on the upper half of the femur last removed. (See wood-cut, fig. 2.) The specimen pre- vious to dissection was successfully injected by my friend Dr. Isaacs, to whose kindness I am indebted for its preparation. It will be perceived that the ap- pearance of the disease corresponds with the descrip- tion already given of the tumor first removed. It is of a uniform bony hardness, and very irregular out- line, involving the lower end of the bone, and extend- ing upward toward the trochanter. One spicular pro- longation projecting toward the joint, on its anterior surface, was grazed by the knife in cutting out the anterior flap; had this flap been half an inch longer, the knife would have been caught behind this bony projection, and the operation unavoidably delayed. This danger was partially recognized beforehand. As this specimen has been preserved in the wet state, the layer of the fibro-cartilage on the surface of the bone can be recognized. In removing the layer of muscles covering the dis- ease, it was noticed that the sartorius and rectus, and most of the adductor group, were closely attached

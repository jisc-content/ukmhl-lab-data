BY A MODIFIED PROCESS. 13 The patient bore the operation well, under the in- fluence of chloroform. It was necessary to administer morphine freely during the first few days following, on account of his restlessness and irritability. Toward the end of the first week erysipelas made its appearance in the stump, and extended thence upon the abdomen, where it ceased. Previous to the appearance of the erysipelas, which at this time was usually prevalent in the city, coincident with the epidemic of typhus fever of 1847-8, the patientâ€™s skin became intensely yellow. About the tenth day, after the erj^sipelas had mostly subsided, the stump sud- denly swelled up and became exceedingly tense, so much so that I apprehended arterial hemorrhage within. There was no pulsation, however, and it proved to be venous. A large coagulum formed, which was eventually dissolved and discharged with the pus from the external openings which were kept freely enlarged. The purulent discharge was con- sequently copious, and highly colored by the blood until the twenty-second day, when the stump had assumed a perfectly healthy appearance. The patient - was early put upon generous diet and tonics, and at the end of the fifth week, the ligatures having all previously come away, the stump was entirely healed. By the end of the sixth week he was again engaged in his occupation, that of a shoemaker, and not ma- terially altered in appearance by his sickness, which I attributed mainly to his early use of supporting treatment. The tumor on examination presented a magnificent specimen of true osteo-cartilaginous exostosis. Its

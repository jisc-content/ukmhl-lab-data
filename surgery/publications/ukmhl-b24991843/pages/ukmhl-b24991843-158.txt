POPLITEAL ANEURISM. 150 Dr. John Moore, the house surgeon of the hospital, to whose persevering attention his cure was mainly owing. He was then perfectly well, engaged in his usual laborious employment, and highly pleased with the result of his treatment. During the application of the compression in this case there was no observable increase in the oedema of the foot and leg, which is to be attributed to the opportu- nities afforded to the veins of the limb to empty them- selves during the alternations of the pressure from the thigh to the groin. There was, however, a harder swell- ing of the tissues on the dorsum of the foot, accompa- nied by redness of the skin and considerable pain, espe- cially on pressure; this followed the use of the com- pressor on both occasions, and subsided from two to three days after its removal. The exact cause of this condition of the parts I was unable to explain.

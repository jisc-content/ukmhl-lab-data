LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 197 In 9 out of the 12 instances in which it caused death, it took place from the wound made in tying the artery, i.e. from the artery itself under the action of the ligature; here the source of danger is a diseased condition of the arterial coats which interferes with the adhesive process, and it is to be avoided by not venturing too near the seat of disease, (when there is a true or spontaneous aneurism depending upon an altered state of the arterial tunics,) and by examin- ing into the condition of the artery, as far as prac- ticable, before passing the ligature around it at the time of operating. This latter precaution has pre- vented the ligature of the arteria innominata in two instances, after the vessel had been laid bare, viz.: in the cases of Dr. Porter, of Dublin, whose patient, strange to say, ultimately recovered spontaneously, and in that of Dr. Hoffman, of this city. It has also caused other operators to hesitate under similar circumstances. In confirmation of this view, we find that eight out of the nine cases in which secondary hemorrhage from the point of ligature proved fatal, were spontaneous or true aneurisms, resulting from alteration of the ar- terial coats and in the remaining one the blood found its way from the axilla upward through the wound above the clavicle. In the remaining three of the twelve cases in which hemorrhage after the operation caused death, two were â€¢ traumatic aneurisms in which the wounded artery fur- nished the hemorrhage after the giving way of the sac, and in the remaining one, the disease for which the artery was tied proved to be an encephaloid tu- mor. In addition to these twelve deaths from hemor- rhage, it occurred in six others of the thirty-three

200 LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. lias been rendered necessary by it, and it is a result which can neither be foreseen nor certainly prevented. The frequency of its occurrence, which is greater, I presume, than is generally supposed by surgeons, shows the necessity of adopting all the precautions usually employed in the case of the lower extremity under similar circumstances. With regard to the period after the operation at which death took place, I find that in one it occurred on the third day, in one on the fourth, in two on the sixth, in one on the eighth, and in another it is simply stated that it took place “in a few days.” Of the six cases, the disease was spontaneous aneu- rism in one-half and traumatic in the other. I am unable, on perusal of the cases, to gain any informa- tion as to particular causes worthy of remark to which the occurrence of gangrene could be attributed. Besides the six cases where it was the cause of death, gangrene of two fingers occurred in an other- wise successful case of Mr. O’Reilly, of Dublin, men- tioned in one of his articles in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, and also in the case of Prof. Parker, of this city. In the successful case recorded by Prof. Alf. C. Post, he was obliged to amputate near the shoulder-joint in consequence of a wound of the axillary artery; this, however, involved the vein and large nervous trunks of the limb. There are, then, in the whole, 8 cases out of the 86, in which gangrene followed the ligature of the sub- clavian artery in its external portion, or nearly 19*4 per cent., and 6 of these were fatal. In looking over the abstract of 149 cases of ligature of the external iliac artery, to which I have already re-

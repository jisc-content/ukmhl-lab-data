(161) CASES STRANGULATED HERNIA OF THE TUNICA VAGINALIS (CONGENITAL HERNIA) OCCURRING IN THE ADULT. WITH REMARKS * I AM induced to record the following cases, both on account of the individual interest which they possess, and also because they illustrate certain features of an interesting and important variety of hernia, which do not seem to have received from practical surgeons as much attention as they deserve. It is the general belief among surgeons that a case of strangulated inguinal hernia requires the same treatment at their hands when the rupture has formed a peritoneal sac for itself in its descent, in the usual mode, as well as in those rarer cases where the pro- trusion occurs through an unobliterated communica- tion between the peritoneum and tunica vaginalis testis, and occupies the latter cavity. In operating for strangulated hernia upon the adult, it is also as- sumed, almost as a matter of course, that the sac of the hernia has been formed by itself in its descent, and that it has no connection with the tunica vaginalis. *From the New York Medical Times, vol. v., May, 1856.

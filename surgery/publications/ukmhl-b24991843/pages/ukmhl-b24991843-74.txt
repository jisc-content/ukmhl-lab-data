66 CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. which have followed the application of the Hunterian operation to its cure, I find a singular discrepancy existing between the opinions of authors and the recorded results of practice. Hodgson (.Diseases of Arteries, etc., Lond., 1815, p. 507) thinks it “probable that tying the artery above the tumor would effect the cure of this disease in the same manner as it does that of circumscribed aneurism—especially where the tumor is increasing;” and adds that he is not aware that the operation has been tried. About this time, Mr. Atkinson, of York, (England,) tied the brachial artery for a large and increasing aneurismal varix, and mortification of the limb en- sued. (S. Cooper, Surg. Diet., Lond., 1839, art. Aneu- rism.) Scarpa (On Aneurism, Wishart’s translation, Edin., 1808, p. 397) expresses the opinion that the surgeon should “not hesitate to perform the operation (of Anel) if the aneurism is still small and circum- scribed.” Physick, shortly afterward, tied the femoral artery for an arterio-venous aneurism below the knee; the limb mortified, and the patient died from hemor- rhage. (.Dorseys Surgery, Philad., 1813, vol. ii. p. 210.) Liston, in recent cases, advocates the Hunterian operation, and, at the same time, acknowledges that he has found it unsuccessful in more than one in- stance. (Prac. Surg., Lond., 1847, 4th ed.) Miller says, “if the disease have existed long, and be of large size, etc., it may be treated on the Hun- terian principle.” (Princ. Surg., 1st Am. ed., p. 342.)

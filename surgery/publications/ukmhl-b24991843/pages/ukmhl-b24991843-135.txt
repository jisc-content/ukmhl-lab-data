I performed the lateral operation on the first of February following, and found the calculus, which consisted entirely of uric acid, to weigh but nine grains. The child recovered rapidly and entirely. Some incontinence of urine continued for six months following the operation. Mr. Martineau, of Norwich, England, is said by Crosse, in his prize essay on Urinary Calculus, to have extracted a calculus weighing only ten grains from a boy thirteen years old; and this is spoken of as being the smallest probably ever removed by opera- tion. This case is the first in which I ever employed chloroform in lithotomy; and I was surprised to find how much larger a staff could be introduced into the bladder under its influence, and also at the immense advantage it afforded in exploring this organ, as well as in the execution of the operation. I have since used the chloroform in nine cases, of which I have preserved a record, and in no instance with the slightest ill effect, with the exception above recorded in the case of Mr. J. A., where its administration was followed by vomiting. From the experience which I have had of the utility of anaesthetics in lithotrity also, it seems to me that their use has been unwisely proscribed in this operation. In support of this view, however, I hope to offer some cases in evidence hereafter. The earliest age at which I have had occasion to cut for stone in the bladder is two years and one month.

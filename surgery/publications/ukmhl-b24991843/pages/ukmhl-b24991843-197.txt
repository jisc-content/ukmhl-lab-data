LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 189 ination was anticipated. On account of his prostra- tion, no very active treatment was employed. A large blister was applied to the nape, he was carefully nour- ished with beef-tea, and had an injection of salt and water daily. Under this management the delirium subsided in a few days, and he very unexpectedly recovered from the acute attack. He has since done very well; he is now walking about, convalescent. The wound above the clavicle was entirely healed some time since, and the cavity in the arm and axilla has contracted down to a linear wound, which is slowly cicatrizing. As yet, I have not been able to detect any pulsation in the radial artery at the wrist. The question may be asked, Why was not this case treated as one of wounded artery, by cutting down and applying a ligature to each end of the wounded vessel ? My reasons for adopting a different treat- ment are these: At the time the patient came under my care the position of the wound in the artery could not be ascertained with sufficient certainty to warrant a search for it; three weeks had elapsed since its oc- currence, and there was the best evidence of the ex- istence of a fluctuating, pulsating cavity of large size communicating with the wound of the artery; in other words, of a large and rapidly increasing trau- matic aneurism, for which the immediate ligature of the main arterial trunk of the limb was the appro- priate remedy, as has been proved by the result. Up to the present date, including the case which I have just narrated, I have collected ninety-seven re- corded instances in which a ligature has been applied

CASES OF STRANGULATED HERNIA 178 cited, could hardly fail to justify the diagnosis of a hernia of the tunica vaginalis. The existence of fluid contained in a cavity in the scrotum, in conjunction with symptoms of strangula- tion, (as in Cases I. and II.,) is too obviously charac- teristic of the form of hernia under consideration to require further remark. In confirmation of the principal practical point which I conceive to be deducible from the cases here recorded, viz., the necessity for laying open the sac in strangulated hernia of the tunica vaginalis, when it can be recognized, I will add, in conclusion, an inter- esting case operated on by the late Mr. Luke, at the London Hospital, and recorded in the London Medical Gazette, vol. ix. p. 102. The patient, twenty-four years of age, was brought to the hospital on the 7th of July, 1831, with a large scrotal rupture, which had appeared for the first time two hours before, from an exertion in raising a large plank. The tumor was large, tense, and extremely painful; the countenance anxious; there was pain in the abdomen, with rejec- tion of everything taken into the stomach. The taxis and warm bath having been tried without success, the operation was performed without loss of time. Mr. Luke made an incision of about four inches, in the direction of the inguinal canal, and extending to the upper part of the tumor; and then carefully cut down to the neck of the sac, which the tendon of the exter- nal oblique was distinctly observed tightly girting, so that it was impossible to introduce a director between them; the stricture was therefore divided from with- out, by means of the point of a scalpel, and then, without opening the sac, the intestines were returned

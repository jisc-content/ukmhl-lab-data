182 LIGATURE OF TIIE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. life is in danger of being sacrificed; and the multi- plication of recorded instances tending to establish its true value, and to illustrate the nature of the cases of disease or injury to whose cure it is applicable, is calculated I conceive to add to the resources of the physician, and thus to benefit humanity. Instances of disease or injury requiring the ligature of the subclavian, or any other large arterial trunk, occur but rarely even to those of the profession who enjoy the most extended scope of observation, and an individual has not therefore an opportunity of acquir- ing sufficient personal experience to enable him to speak positively as to the amount of risk and the prospect of benefit, etc. which belong to the opera- tion,â€”questions which patients and their friends have a right to ask and to which it is desirable that answers should be furnished when the facts are at hand to sup- ply them. These facts are only to be gathered from a careful study of the recorded experience of others; and with this object I have collected together the heads of a large number of cases on which ligature of the subclavian artery has been performed, and a slight abstract of these, bearing upon certain points of in- terest connected with the operation, I propose to add to the account of the case which I am about to re- port, hoping that such data may not prove uninterest- ing, at least for reference, to those of the Society par- ticularly interested in surgery, and that their general results may be acceptable to all. I am aware that tabulated abstracts of the opera- tions upon most of the large arteries, with a view to statistical results, are already before the profession, and the excellent tables prepared by Dr. Norris, of

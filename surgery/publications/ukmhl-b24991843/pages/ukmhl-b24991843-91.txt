83 MALIGNANT POLYPUS OF THE NOSE. the ligature was imbedded; the nervous trunks (the descendens noni and par vagum) were free from any morbid appearance. A clot occupied the artery, from the bifurcation of the innominata to the point of liga- ture, which was evidently adherent to its lining mem- brane ; above the ligature another clot, plainly of more recent formation, extended to the bifurcation of the artery, and two or three lines into the internal carotid. The above case presents an interesting example of a disease of rather unfrequent occurrence. Cancer of the nasal cavities, generally known as “malignant polypus,” is liable to assume all the varieties which characterize the cancerous deposit in other parts of the body, although the encephaloid form of the dis- ease occurs by far the most frequently in this situa- tion. The encephaloid deposit varies greatly, both in its degree of vascularity and in the rapidity of its growth. In the present instance the progress of the malady was unusually slow, while the vascularity of the tumor was excessive—profuse hemorrhages pre- ceding apparently the development of the disease, and accompanying its growth, unprovoked by any inter- ference. This latter circumstance seemed to warrant the hope that diminishing its supply of blood would impede the growth of the tumor. The characteristic appearance of the fungus which protruded through the integuments of the face a few days before the operation, together with the microscopic structure of • the tumor, and the coexistence of incipient cancer of the uterus, render the nature of the disease unques- tionable; while the presence of obsolete tubercles in the lungs furnish further evidence against the antago-

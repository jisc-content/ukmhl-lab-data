CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. 56 tolerant of pain. In any case, the attempt could not exert other than a favorable influence upon the suc- cess of the subsequent operation by throwing the stress of the circulation temporarily upon the anastomosing branches, and thus contributing to their enlargement, an object which can never be regarded as entirely unne- cessary, inasmuch as gangrene follows this operation suf- ficiently often, even under the most favorable circum- stances, to keep the surgeon ever alive to its danger.* There are several cases on record, of inguinal aneu- rism, in which pressure applied directly to the tumor has succeeded in curing the disease. Dr. Albers (.Med.-Chir. Trans., vol. ix.) relates a case in which, the patient having refused to submit to an operation, pressure was applied to the tumor by means of a pad and screw; at first it could not be borne on account of the pain, but it was afterward continued more moderately for a period of seven months, at the expiration of which time the disease was found to have been cured. The same surgeon relates a second instance in which pressure was continued for six years without success; some benefit must, however, have followed the remedy in this case, as the disease would not probably have continued so long a time without a fatal result if it had not been employed. Dr. Oâ€™Bryan Bellingham (Dublin Quart. Jour., vol. xxii.) employed pressure by means of straps and bandages with a good result for an aneurism of the external iliac artery for which he had previously ap- plied a ligature to the same vessel,'f the disease hav- ing reappeared a year later. * See note, p. 29. f This case is incorrectly stated by Mr. Crisp (Dis., etc. of Blood-

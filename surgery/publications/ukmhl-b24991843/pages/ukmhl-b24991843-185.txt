177 OF THE TUNICA VAGINALIS. of dividing the neck of the sac at the internal ring before relieving the stricture. In connection with this fact, is to be noticed the central constriction of the sac in two cases, (V. and VII.) I suspect, from frequent examination of the parts in the dead body, that the process of peritoneum connecting its cavity with the tunica vaginalis testis remains unobliterated more frequently than is generally supposed; and that the effort at obliteration is more marked at the inter- nal ring, and just above the testis, (Case III.;) and that this circumstance explains the frequency of stricture at the internal ring, as well as the constriction ob- served at or below the middle of the sac. The hour-glass shape, often observed in cases of hydrocele, is similarly explained; and the general resemblance in shape between hydrocele and hernia of the tunica vaginalis is a point of interest in con- nection with the diagnosis of the latter. In the same connection, the mode of formation of encysted hydro- cele of the cord is illustrated by the condition of the parts observed in the dissection of Case III. The sudden occurrence of a rupture, descending at once into the scrotum, (as in Cases IV. and VI.,) has already been recognized as a characteristic feature of hernia of the tunica vaginalis; and to this might be added liability to excessive distention of the scrotum and inguinal canal, with simultaneous strangulation at the neck of the sac, (which generally corresponds with the internal abdominal ring,) accompanied by symptoms of sudden shock to the system, severe local pain, and inability to assume the upright position. In fact, the combination of these symptoms, when occurring in a young adult, as in the cases above

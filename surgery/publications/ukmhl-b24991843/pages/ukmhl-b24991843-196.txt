188 LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. cellular tissue of the limb, and its temperature was better, but still below the natural standard. Yeast was applied locally, and the supporting treatment con- tinued. On the seventh day the slough had separated suffi- ciently to allow the escape of about a pound of coag- ulated blood from the aneurismal cavity. On the fourteenth day the dead tissues had all en- tirely separated, and the loss of substance, which at first seemed very considerable, is rendered less by the diminution in the size of the limb. Its cavity is granulating, and the strength of the patient is fair; he is taking quinine and generous diet. On the fifteenth day the ligature separated from the artery. About this time he had an attack of ery- sipelas, which, on subsiding, left a collection of pus on the outside of the arm just above the elbow. This was evacuated by means of an incision, and on the succeeding day a slight hemorrhage occurred, in which the blood escaped both from the recent incision and through the cavity on the front of the arm. The quantity of blood lost was inconsiderable, and fortu- nate^ the hemorrhage did not recur. The original wound is healing. During the month following there were several re- turns of the erysipelas, and the patientâ€™s condition became somewhat critical. He was removed from the ward into a private room. Shortly after this, coincident with a sudden change of temperature, he became delirious, with an exceedingly rapid pulse, which at one time exceeded 150 in the minute, and the next day had several convulsions. The ex- istence of arachnitis was suspected, and a fatal term-

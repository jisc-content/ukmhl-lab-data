Several other cases have since come to my knowl- edge, in which secondary hemorrhage, after lithotomy in adult males, has occurred about the same period, seemingly assignable to a similar cause. I do not re- member to have seen any record of instances of hemorrhage arising under these circumstances; but I should be disposed to adopt appropriate precautions in view of its possible occurrence. The patient subsequently made a good recovery. III. LITHOTOMY IN A CHILD—CONGENITAL URIC ACID CALCULUS OF VERY SMALL SIZE—CHLOROFORM. Thomas Cudbirtii, three years of age, was brought to me by his father, in January, 1848, with evident symp- toms of stone in the bladder, which, on examination, proved to be the case. He had never passed his water since his birth without more or less evidence of pain, as I was subsequently assured by both of his parents, and had been in the habit of pulling at his prepuce from a very early period.

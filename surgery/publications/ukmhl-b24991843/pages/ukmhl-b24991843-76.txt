68 CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. tumor, “the operation of Anel may hereafter become more successful.”* It is worthy of remark that neither Astley Cooper, Surg. Led., Phil., 1826, vol. ii. p. 37, nor Colles, Surg. Led., Phil., 1845, p. 197, had encountered a case of this disease which seemed to require operative interference. Most of the authorities who oppose the application of the Hunterian principle to the cure of arterio-venous aneurism, base their objections to the operation upon its inefficiency; inasmuch as experience, has shown that the disease almost invariably returns after its performance. The danger of gangrene is only alluded to incidentally. Breschet recognizes it, and attempts an explanation of the mode in which it occurs. S. Cooper {ut supra) adopts Breschet’s rationale, and bases his unfavorable opinion of the operation upon it, and a case of Sir Charles Bell, which was followed by gangrene. The author of the article on aneurism, in the Cyclopaedia of Surgery, asks the question why gangrene of the limb occurs more frequently after ligature of its main arterial trunk for this disease, than for the other varieties of aneurism; but he leaves it unanswered, and the question of the propriety of the operation, unsettled. Breschet accounts for the occurrence of the gan- grene in the following manner: He asserts (loco citato, pp. 209, 252) that he has seen in the living body, during an operation upon a case of arterio-venous * A case is recorded (London Lancet, Oct. 1834, p. 144) of varicose aneurism at the bend of the arm, in which the communication with the vein was obliterated by pressure, and, the disease being thus reduced to a simple circumscribed false aneurism, the brachial artery was tied suc- cessfully by Mr. Lloyd.

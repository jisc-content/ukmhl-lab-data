198 LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. fatal cases, and contributed more or less to their un- successful result without directly causing it. Hemor- rhage is also mentioned as having occurred in eight of the cases which subsequently terminated favorably; it took place, therefore, to a greater or less extent, in twenty-six cases out of the eighty-six which I have recorded, or in nearly one-third, and was fatal in twelve cases out of the twenty-six. I find that after hemorrhage from the artery at the seat of ligature, resulting from a deficiency in the reparative process, caused by a morbid condition of the arterial coats, the next most frequent source of bleeding, in the cases on record, is from the seat of the disease in the artery, generally the axilla, whether this disease has been a spontaneous aneurism, a trau- matic aneurism, or a simple wound of the artery. And hemorrhage from this source has occurred at an earlier period, and most frequently where the sub- clavian has been tied for a wound of the axillary ar- tery, no aneurismal tumor having formed; thus con- firming the propriety of the rule in surgery, that the best treatment for a wounded artery, where feasible, is to cut down and tie it above and below the wound, and never to have recourse to the ligature of the main arterial trunk of the limb until this course has been proved to be impracticable. Thus, on reference to the facts already stated, we find that in fourteen in- stances where the subclavian was tied for a wounded axillary artery, one-half the cases perished. It will be readily understood, then, that hemorrhage from the seat of disease has occurred in more cases of trau- matic than of spontaneous aneurisms; and that in both it has followed sloughing, suppuration, or open-

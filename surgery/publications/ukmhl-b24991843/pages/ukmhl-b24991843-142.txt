134 CASES OF YESICAL CALCULUS. ceecled finally, however, in introducing, without force, a simple steel sound of medium size, and possessing a very short curve; and upon this instrument I de- termined to cut into the bladder. Its convexity was bared by means of the usual incision for the lateral operation through the perineum; and through the opening into the urethra thus made, I inserted the extremity of a full-sized silver director, purposing to carry this instrument into the bladder alongside of the sound, and upon it as a guide to incise the pros- tate gland. Its point, however, was arrested by some obstacle before it entered the bladder, and I could not succeed in feeling the stones with it. I pro- longed my incision, nevertheless, upon the director, laying open the urethra onward toward the neck of the bladderâ€”some pus mixed with urine escaped; and on withdrawing the director and introducing the finger, I recognized distinctly that I had cut into an old abscess, about the size of an English walnut, situated between the prostate gland and the rectum. In feeling around the walls of this abscess, I detected, with the point of the finger, an orifice which seemed to open into the prostatic portion of the urethra; and through this orifice I again introduced the di- rector, which now evidently entered the bladder and came in contact with a fragment of the stone. I now withdrew the steel sound from the bladder, and, cutting with the beaked knife upon the groove of the director as upon a straight staff, made an incision of moderate extent into the neck of the bladder and prostate gland. The finger introduced through the wound detected the position of the fragments, which were caught and withdrawn by the forceps without

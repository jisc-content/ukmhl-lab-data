LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 193 the clavicle. Where Keate applied his ligature, is now known as the axillary artery, surgical anatomy having since defined the boundaries and limits of parts more accurately. This operation was repeated in 1815 by Chamberlaine, 1813 by Blasius,- and in 1835 by Catanoso, in Sicily, in each instance for a wound of the axillary artery or traumatic aneurism of recent formation, and with but one fatal result out of the four cases. This, a case of wounded axillary ar- tery was improperly treated, according to Prof. Blasius, at first, as in his opinion the wounded artery should have been sought for and tied in the wound; this had not been done, however, and after repeated hem- orrhages he was called to tie the main trunk on the twentieth day, as the only chance remaining for the patient. He tied it as near as possible to the seat of the injury; but the patient sank exhausted from the previous loss of blood, and died on the following day. But the most successful, and consequently the most useful of the operations upon the subclavian arteries is its ligature in the third part of its course or external portion, beyond the scaleni muscles. Here the anatomical relations of the arteries are similar on either side of the body. This operation was first performed at St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital, in London, by Mr. Ramsden, in 1809, but like many other of the operations on the great vessels, which afterward be- came generally adopted, its first essays were unsuc- cessful. The first human life saved by it was in the hands of Prof. Wright Post, in this city, in the year 1817; it was afterward successfully performed for the first time in Great Britain, by Liston, in 1820. Of the 101 cases which I have collected, the opera-

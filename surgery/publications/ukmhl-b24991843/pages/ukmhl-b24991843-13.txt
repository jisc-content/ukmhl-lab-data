(v) PREFACE. The following Surgical Papers have been selected from the professional periodicals in which they were originally published, and thrown together in the pres- ent form, in the hope that they may prove useful to those interested in the pursuit of practical surgery. Their only merit consists in the fidelity of the record they present of the results of actual practice; and the Author regrets that the unremitting claims of daily professional duty must he proffered in explanation of their obvious imperfections.

MALIGNANT POLYPUS OF THE NOSE. 79 made its appearance over the os nasi of the right side —evidently a growth from the tumor within, the bone being absorbed by its pressure. November 21st. Tumor has increased in size more rapidly of late, causing much pain over the right eye, uneasiness in the right side of the head, and ringing in the right ear. Patient’s general health moderately good, although declining from the constant distress and consequent sleeplessness. She has not been in the habit of using opiates. 22d. Consultation on the propriety of ligature of right carotid artery. Agreed that it should be done as soon as possible, as the only means of palliating the progress of the disease. There is to-day consider- able erythema around the external tumor at the base of the nose, with oedema of eyelids on both sides, ex- citement of the circulation, and increased pain of the head. No sleep last night. Patient is anxious to have anything done that promises even temporary relief. 1^. ol. ric. Si—to be followed after its opera- tion by a full opiate. Cold lotion of lead and opium, and mustard pediluvium. 23d. More comfortable in every respect. An eschar, the size of a sixpence, has formed on the summit of the external tumor. Had some sleep. Ordered Seid- litz powder and light animal food. The tumor can be felt projecting backward, through the posterior nares, by the finger in the fauces, and can be seen anteriorly filling the cavity of the nose, and project- ing slightly from the right nostril. Pressure upon the right primitive carotid causes visible diminution in the bulk of the tumor, and stops the painful throb- bing which the patient always feels in it.

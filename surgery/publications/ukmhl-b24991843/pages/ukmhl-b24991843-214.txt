206 SALIVARY FISTULA. How of saliva was profuse, and of constant recurrence when the gland was excited, rendering the patientâ€™s condition extremely unpleasant. An operation for his relief had already been attempted without suc- cess. The amount of cicatricial tissue in the cheek, and the shortness of the remaining portion of the duct of Steno, were recognized as the principal ob- stacles to the success of an operation. Dr. Van Buren planned and executed the following operation in May last, which, after some delay, has resulted in an entire cure. The orifice of the fistula was circumscribed by two curved incisions, in the direction of the fibers of the buccinator muscle, isolating a portion of the skin of the cheek of an elliptical shape, and leaving a wound an inch and a quarter in length. The iso- lated portion of integument, with the fistulous orifice in its center, was dissected up from its connections, except with the duct, and this was traced up and iso- lated as far as the substance of the gland. The knife was then carried through the cicatricial tissue, fat, and fibers of the buccinator, just in front of the anterior border of the masseter muscle, until the mucous membrane of the mouth alone intervened be- tween the bottom of the wound and the buccal cavity. The elliptical portion of skin was now trimmed down to a circular disk about one-third of an inch in di- ameter, with the fistulous orifice in its center, and through this disk of skin two silver wires were carried by needles, parallel with its surface, one on either side of the orifice of the fistula. The two ends of this double wire were then, by means of large-eyed needles, carried from the bottom of the wound,

CASES OF VESICAL CALCULUS. 122 night and day, his urine containing much adhesive mucus, and possessing the usual offensive odor. To enable him to pass the instrument with more facility, he was in the habit of bending and slightly breaking the extremity of each of his catheters opposite to its last eye—a manoeuvre not unfrequently employed by old stricture patients.

It grew rapidly, and in two weeks reached its present size, compelling him to abandon his occu- pation.

The limb at this point measures over nineteen inches in circumference. The pulsations of the tumor are synchronous with those of the heart, and are equally perceptible on all parts of it; they are controlled by pressure applied to the femoral artery at the groin. There is much oedema of the leg, and the superficial veins about the knee are greatly distended. On the 4th of March treatment by 'pressure was commenced by means of Dupuytren’s instrument ap- plied over the femoral artery, above the middle of the thigh, alternated, as often as the pain rendered a change necessary, by the pressure of the fingers of an assistant at the groin. The pressure of the instru- ment when first applied was very painful; but the patient in a short time became accustomed to it, and bore it throughout the treatment on an average for half an hour at a time.

During the day he complained little, and was able to occupy himself in reading; at night, how- ever, it was necessary to administer morphine, under the influence of which he slept for half an hour at a time. The pressure was steadily maintained at a de-

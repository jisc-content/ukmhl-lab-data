208 SALIVARY FISTULA. ish the tension of the duct, which was barely an inch in length. The inflammation of the parotid gland Dr. Y. B. attributed to an experiment he instituted, on the authority of Prof. Claude Bernard, of the Col- lege ol France, who asserts, as the result of his phys- iological experiments, that the injection of any fatty substance (corps grcdsseux) into the duct of the paro- tid will arrest its secretion and produce atrophy of the gland. He injected the fistula with melted lard by means of an Anelâ€™s syringe, carefully and thor- oughly, as the first step of the operation related above, but the result was negative. The gland is still secreting freely as ever, at the end of nine months, as was demonstrated by examination of the patient to-day, when the orifice of the new duct was distinctly seen discharging saliva into the mouth, the external cicatrix having softened down, and being entirely concealed by the whisker.* * The object sought by this operation was to remove the open end of the parotid duct, from the external surface of the cheek to its normal relation to the mucous wall of the mouth, as perfectly as its diminished length would permit, and to keep it there by means of a ligature, which should at the same time perform the office of a setou and establish a permanent opening into the mouth; and also to have a clean wound in the cheek, which could be successfully closed by silver sutures. It is a mode of operation which Arclpeau claims to have proposed in 1823, but "which he states (Oper. Surg., vol. iii. p. 32, Am. ed.) has not yet been put to the test. The employment of silver wire seems to have conduced to the success of the operation.

At the end of a week we again used the speculum, and found the irritable-looking ulcer transformed into an innocent, healthy sore, with thin white edges and a granulating center, presenting half its previous size. The lacerations produced by the operation had entirely healed, leaving no trace. She used daily enemata for another week, and then a dinner pill at night, as re- quired, and when she left the city, at the end of a month, was perfectly well.

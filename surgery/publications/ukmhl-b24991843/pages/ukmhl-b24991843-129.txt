9 (121) CASES OF VESICAL CALCULUS! TREATED BY LITHOTOMY AND LITHOTRITY * I. STONE IN THE BLADDER FORMED UPON A FRAGMENT OF CATHETER, IN A PATIENT WITH STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA, SUCCESSFULLY TREATED BY LITHOTRITY. Mr. J. L., forty-three years of age, had been under my care from time to time for several years, with an old permanent stricture of the urethra, complicated with catarrh of the bladder. I had succeeded in di- lating his stricture at three several periods, so as to receive a No. 8 or 9 with ease, and had very much improved the condition of his bladder by the use of injections of nitrate of silver; but on each occasion he abandoned the treatment, satisfied with this partial improvement, and as often allowed his stricture to contract again. In March, 1851, his condition was such that he was in the habit of introducing a No. 5 flexible cathe- ter eight or ten times in the course of the twenty-four hours, and of urinating as often as every half hour, * From the New York Medical Times, vols. ii. and iii.

AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT 20 attach more importance than to any of the others, as distinguishing an exostosis from a malignant tumor of bone. And yet in many cases of the osteo-carti- laginous variety of exostosis, like the present, where the irregular outline of the bone is covered with a variable layer of cartilage, this characteristic is by no means well marked. The slowness of growth of the tumor would seem to be no evidence of absence of malignity, nor yet its ori- gin in mechanical violence. Uniform hardness of sur- face is also met with in soft cancer of bone, where the disease commences in its medullary cavity, in the earlier stages of its growth;* it is also met with in en- chondroma under the same circumstances, and in other non-malignant growths when they take their origin within the cavities of the bones. As to the matter of pain, about which so much is said in connection with the diagnosis of malignant disease, I do not hesitate to say that its presence or absence affords no useful indication whatever as to the nature of the disease in tumors connected with bone. I shall not trespass upon the attention of the Academy at present, by at- tempting to demonstrate the truth of this assertion, but will merely remark that in the careful analysis of more than one hundred and fifty cases of malignant disease with regard to this point, I was driven to the conclusion that there is no variety of pain strictly characteristic of any form of cancer, or of the disease in general. In a large proportion of the cases of soft cancer, there was total absence of the symptom; but occasionally, when a nervous trunk was subjected to tension, the pain was excessiveâ€”it was always, how- ever, attributable to the tension or to inflammation

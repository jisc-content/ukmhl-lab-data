LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 183 Philadelphia, on this particular subject are among the best of the kind. It is not my intention, therefore, to reproduce a tabular statement, but since its publica- tion in 1845 quite a number of additional cases have been placed on record by which our knowledge on some points may be rendered more positive, and I shall simply make use of them, in connection with the cases already collected, with the view of elucida- ting the actual value, as a means of saving life, of the operation in question.

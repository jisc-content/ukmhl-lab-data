190 LIGATURE OF TIIE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. to the subclavian arteries, and I have learned the particulars of four other cases verbally from the oper- ators, making in all one hundred and one; these in- clude, of course, operations upon each of the three divisions of the artery and on both sides of the body. I do not know that I have succeeded in finding all the cases which have been placed upon record; but the number is large enough to serve as a fair foundation for statistical data. There is one circumstance which has forced itself upon my attention in looking over the records of the operation, viz., that those followed by recovery are more fully reported in general than those of an oppo- site termination; indeed, in regard to the latter, the data are sometimes painfully scanty; and from this I infer that in the cases which have never reached the light, the average mortality is probably much greater than the result of my investigation will show it to be. This is one of the unavoidable sources of fallacy in researches of this nature; and, after having stated it fairly, each must make his own allowances for such sources of error in his estimate of the result. In the 101 cases, the ligature was applied upon the artery within the scaleni muscles in 8 instancesâ€” 7 times on the right side, and once on the left. Colies, of Dublin, was the first who placed a liga- ture on the internal portion of the subclavian on the right side, and his patient died on the eighth day with a wound of the pleura. In every succeed- ing instance in which this operation has been at- tempted, death has followed from secondary hemor- rhage, at periods varying from the twelfth to the thirty-sixth day, with the exception of the most re-

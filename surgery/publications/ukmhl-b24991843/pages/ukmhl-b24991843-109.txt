FIBROUS TUMOR OF THE LEFT OVARIUM. 101 and this mode of treatment was carried out under the conviction, which I have long possessed, that in almost all forms of abdominal inflammation, opium is our most reliable remedy. This point in therapeutics, which I believe was first insisted upon by Gooch, I have fre- quently tested to its fullest extent, with the most satis- factory results. It was in fact the confidence I felt in the power of opium to prevent inflammation of the peritoneum, and in the influence of chloroform to avert the danger of shock to the system, that induced me to undertake the performance of an operation of which I hold no very high opinion, and which, even in so inviting a case, I should have hesitated to do without the sanction of my surgical friends. There is, I conceive, a very close analogy between the influence exerted by opium and chloroform in averting the injurious effects of violence inflicted upon the organism,â€”as for example, by a severe surgical operation. I have witnessed the abdominal viscera of a delicate female exposed to the air, by an incision sixteen inches in length, for more than half an hour, handled, sponged, and bathed in the contents of rup- tured ovarian cysts, while the pulse beneath my finger (as in the case which I have just recorded) did not vary from 75 beats in the minute, and characterized by all the rhythm, regularity, and volume of health; and this not succeeded by any collapse on the return of consciousness. It would be hard to believe that a state of things similar to this could exist, unless there were some protective agency extended to the nervous centers, rendering them unconscious, as it were, of the amount of injury being sustained by the system. Unless I deceive myself, I have witnessed this same

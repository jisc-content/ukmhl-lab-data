12 AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT This view of the nature of his disease I communi- cated to Mr. V., informing him also of the probable continuance of its injurious influence upon his gen- eral health, and eventually upon his life, and advised him accordingly, as the tumor could not be removed, to lose the limb. He consented to this course, and on the 20th May, 1848, I removed the limb by the double flap opera- tion, using chloroform, which acted well. In view of the benign character of the disease, I was anxious to save as much of the thigh as possible by sawing through the femur close to the tumor, and to effect this it was necessary to encroach upon the soft parts covering the diseased mass, in order to obtain flaps of the necessary size. The shape of the tumor enabled me to make the lower flap of full dimensions by carrying the knife close up to the portion of the bony mass which projected posteriorly. As the upper flap, however, could not be made in the same manner bv transfixion, because the tumor extended so much farther upward on the front of the thigh, I made a semicircular sweep of the knife through the tissues covering the tumor, and dissected up the flap thus circumscribed, from its surface, so that when the flaps were drawn well back by the retractor, I was able to saw through the femur just above its middle, and exactly on a line with the uppermost edge of the tumor on the front of the thigh. (See wood-cut, fig. 2.) The femur at the point where it was sawn through was to all appearance perfectly sound. The flaps were ample and well proportioned, and looked pre- cisely as if they had been made from a healthy thigh.

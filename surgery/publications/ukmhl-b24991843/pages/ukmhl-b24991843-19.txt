On its anterior aspect it was generally spherical in shape, with slight irregularities on its surface; pos- teriorly it was very irregular and craggy, presenting several hard, projecting, knobby eminences. It had everywhere the feel of bone covered with a thin layer of tissues. It was not tender to the touch, although there was a point where the skin had recently as- sumed a dusky-red appearance, which caused some complaint, apparently the result of simple tension of the integuments. There were no large veins observable on its sur- face. The tumor was more prominent on the posterior aspect of the limb than elsewhere, and seemed to terminate abruptly about six and a half inches above the condyles of the femur; anteriorly it shelved off more gradually, and extended apparently some four inches farther upward. The knee-joint was but slightly movable, and its motions were not accom- panied by pain. During the past year he had suffered almost con- stantly from a dull aching pain in the tumor, which was invariably more severe at night, and in damp weather. This pain seemed to be gradually increas- ing in intensity, and had of late deprived him of sleep and diminished his appetite. He was also losing flesh, and had a pulse more frequent than natural. I arrived at the conclusion that the tumor was benign in its character, and that it was most proba- bly an exostosis of the femur; and also that the pain was caused by the tension of the soft parts, more par- ticularly of the nervous trunks, resulting from the growth of the bone, which seemed to have been of late more rapid than formerly.

CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. 75 In the sound and judicious remarks appended by Dr. Norris to the notice of Lallemand’s case (14) in the Am. Journ. Med. Sci., October, 1841, he asserts that “all reason and experience on the subject go to show that no good result can be expected from the application of a ligature above the tumor in this dis- ease.” Are we not fully justified by the facts thus set forth, with regard to the ligature of the artery on the Hunterian principle in arterio-venous aneurism, in arriving at the conclusion that the operation not only promises no good result, but that its perform- ance is absolutely unjustifiable? In confirmation of this conclusion, I am happy to have it in my power to state that Prof. Mott, in view of the results shown above, admits its entire correct- ness, and has recently given an opinion adverse to that expressed by him in the American edition of Velpeau’s Operative Surgery, already quoted.

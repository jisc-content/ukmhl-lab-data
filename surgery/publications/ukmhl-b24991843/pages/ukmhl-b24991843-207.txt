LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 199 ing of the sac, and has been furnished through the collateral channels by which the circulation at the seat of the disease has been restored. To sum up, then, with regard to hemorrhage, the most dangerous symptom which can follow the oper- ation under consideration, it is most to be feared from the seat of the ligature, and about the period of its usual separation, (say from the tenth to the fifteenth day,) and in cases of spontaneous or true aneurism. (It has already been seen that this is the form of dis- ease for which in much the larger proportion of cases the operation has been required.) In cases of traumatic aneurism, or wounded artery, it is most to be feared from the seat of the disease, and is liable to occur at any period after the establishment of the collateral circulation in the limb, and until all wounds are healed. Before leaving the subject of hemorrhage, I will refer to two cases on record, in which the sac of the aneurism involving the external portion of the artery, and extending above the clavi- cle, was accidentally perforated during the operation, giving rise to fearful loss of blood. The operators were Travers and Mott, and the hemorrhage in each instance was permanently controlled by pressure, al- though Mr. Traversâ€™s patient subsequently died from inflammation in the cavity of the chest. The next most frequent cause of death after liga- ture of the subclavian in its external portion has been shown to be gangrene, to which the unsuccessful result of six cases out of thirty-three is attributed. This is the immediate consequence of interruption of the circulation in the limb, either by the disease itself, or by the ligature of its main arterial trunk, which

Plaving obtained the assistance of a sufficient num- ber of my friends, whose devotion to their object cer- tainly deserved better success, we commenced press- ure with the fingers upon the artery about an inch above the crural arch, on the 1st of August, at twelve oâ€™clock M., having previously evacuated the bowels and placed the patient upon a hard mattress, under the influence of digitalis, by which the pulsations of the heart were reduced to 45 per minute. It was thought better that cold should not be applied to tlie tumor. During the first eight or ten hours, the pressure was accurately kept up, and borne without complaint; some pain and restlessness then occurred, which was measurably relieved by morphia. At the end of twenty-four hours, although the pain was en- durable, we found that much more decided pressure was required to restrain the pulsation in the tumor; this difficulty continued to increase as well as the pain, which became very severe, especially at the time of changing hands; and finally, at midnight on the 2d, after having been faithfully maintained during thirty-six hours, it was found necessary to discontinue the pressure. The condition of the tumor was apparently unal- tered.

CASES OF VESICAL CALCULUS. 135 further dela}^; they were four in number, their sur- faces worn smooth by attrition, and their united weight about Siijss. The hemorrhage was slight; the bladder, as well as the cavity of the abscess, was well washed out with warm water slightly acidu- lated, at the suggestion of Prof. Post, by a few drops of nitric acid. I satisfied myself that the abscess was fairly laid open throughout its whole extent, and the patient was then put to bed in a passably comfort- able state. He rallied well from the operation, and, without any addition to the usual treatment of a stone patient after lithotomy, he slowly and gradually made a full and perfect recovery. In a little more than two months after the oper- ation he was perfectly well, and resumed his business occupations. A month later he called at my office, and, after stating that he was perfectly free from all trouble about the urinary organs, mentioned, casually, that he had noticed occasionally a little moisture about the cicatrix of the wound in the perineum, not accompanied, however, by any uneasy sensations whatever. I placed him in a good light, and detected, at the upper extremity of the cicatrix, a minute ori- fice, out of which I succeeded in squeezing a drop of serous fluid. Into this orifice I introduced a probe of the smallest size, and carried it in, with some management, to the depth of an inch, when it came in contact with a small mass of calculous matter. This I concluded was either a concretion since the operation, or a fragment left at the time of its per- formance, which had lodged in the cavity of the ab- scess, out of the current of the urine, and had thus been retained. I proposed to dilate the sinus, and

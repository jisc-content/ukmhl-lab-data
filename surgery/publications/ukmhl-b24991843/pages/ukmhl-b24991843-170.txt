162 CASES OF STRANGULATED HERNIA Influenced by these impressions, I own that I have been surprised to see the testicle so often brought in view when the sac of an inguinal hernia has been laid open, and perhaps the more so, as the congenital character of the rupture has not been generally antici- pated. In reviewing the following cases, I think that certain features will be recognized as peculiar to hernia of the tunica vaginalis, and dependent upon the me- chanism of its formation, by which it may be distin- guished from the more common variety of inguinal rupture. And if, owing to the peculiar mechanism of this species of hernia, the stricture by which it is strangulated is always seated at the neck of its sac, as in all the cases which follow, it then becomes a matter of practical importance that it should be re- cognized before operating; because any operation for its relief which does not include the opening of the sac and division of its neck will be obviously im- proper. Mr. Luke’s case, quoted at the close of this paper, would seem to confirm this assertion. It is hardly necessary to remark that the term “congenital,” originally applied to hernia of the tunica vaginalis by Haller, is not only incorrect, but singu- larly unfortunate, as its very general employment serves to perpetuate erroneous ideas in relation to the disease. In every one of the cases which I am about to re- late, the rupture made its first appearance at a period more or less removed from birth.

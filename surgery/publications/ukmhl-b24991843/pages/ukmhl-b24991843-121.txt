DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. 113 Case.—An English lady of thirty-five was sent to me by my friend Dr. Sabine, in 1861. She had been suffering excessive pain after defecation for more than a year, to relieve which she had resorted to the use of opium in considerable quantities. She was a woman of strong character and excellent morale, and, morti- fied by the habit she had acquired, she had determined to break it, and bear the “ bitter pain,” as she termed it, by embarking on a voyage to China to join her husband, without any opium in her possession, and with this resolution had come to New York. I ex- amined the rectum, and finding an ulcer in the same part of the gut as in the last case, dilated the sphincter on the spot. A thrombus about the size of an English walnut formed around one side of the anus within a few minutes after the operation, but she complained of no after-pains. The next morning, being accus- tomed to their use, she took an enema of tepid flax- seed tea, had a free evacuation, with very slight inconvenience, and no return of the “ bitter pain.” She went out every day, complained of little or no local soreness, and started on her voyage without any opium, and without any necessity for its use. The thrombus in this case resulted from the rupture of a superficial vein. 1 have also, in several instances, lacerated the mucous membrane in dilating the anus, but have never seen the slightest trouble follow either of these accidents. The paralyzed and quiescent con- dition of the sphincter after dilatation secures rest and protection from violence to the parts within its grasp, and the process of repair takes place at once, and is rapidly completed.

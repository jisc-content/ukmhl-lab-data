After arresting the trifling hemorrhage, an opening was then made into the trachea about its sixth or seventh ring, which was enlarged upward, with a probe-pointed bistoury, as far as its first ring.

The opinion was expressed by Dr. Mott that the seed evidently came from above, i.e. from the larynx. From the moment of the expulsion of the seed it was noticed that the child’s breathing became per- fectly free and natural, the whistling and the peculiar cough recurring no more. Within a few minutes the edges of the external wound were brought together without inconvenience, and retained by sutures and plaster.

The child was kept insensible until the dressings were completed, a period in all of fifty-five minutes, and he was then carefully covered, and allowed to sleep without the slightest disturbance.

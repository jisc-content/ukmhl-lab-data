109 DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. safety, and thorough efficiency as a substitute for the knife is not as generally appreciated by the profes- sion as it should be. According to my belief, it is the proper remedy for the disease under considera- tion, and a glance at the pathology of irritable ulcer and the physiological condition of the sphincter mus- cle will, I think, establish the position. The immediate cause of the peculiar and insupport- able pain of an irritable ulcer of the rectum is the constant and involuntary spasmodic contraction of the sphincter ani muscle, by which the sensitive sore is continually squeezed and pinched. This explana- tion is in accordance with the latest physiological researches. In the Transactions of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, of the 8th of June last, the re- sult of certain experiments made in his laboratory by MM. Gianuzzi and Newrocki wras presented by Prof. Bernard, of the College of France, as to the “influ- ence of the nerves upon the sphincters of the urinary bladder and anus.” This is their conclusion:— “The preceding experiments appear to us to de- monstrate that the sphincter muscles of the bladder and anus are, during life, in a constant state of tonic or involuntary muscular contraction, which state is due to the influence of their nerves.” Now, it is fair to infer that the presence of a pain- ful ulcer, seated on that portion of the mucous mem- brane of the rectum which is grasped by its sphincter muscle, must, through the medium of reflex action, greatly intensify the nervous influence which stimu- lates this contraction. And the fibers of the muscle, thus stimulated to constant^ increased spasmodic effort, are continually subjecting the already tender

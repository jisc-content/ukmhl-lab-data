WITH OBSERVATIONS.* The following cases, in which the operation of tracheotomy was required, occurred through the contingencies of practice, in rapid succession, within the space of a few weeks. As the true value of any surgical operation can only be arrived at by comparing and digesting the result of a large number of instances in which it has been per- formed, it would seem to be the duty of individuals to place upon record plain and truthful accounts of such cases as fall within their observation, in order that each may contribute his mite to the mass of experi- ence fron^ which only correct final results can be de- duced. The present cases furnish also, as far as I am able to judge, examples of the most ordinary termina- tion of the operation under the several circumstances . detailed; and for these reasons, therefore, I have ven- tured to bring them before the notice of the Academy. * From the Transactions of the New York Academy of Medicine,

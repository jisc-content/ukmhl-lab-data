She was a young woman of fine appearance, and a recent opportunity which had offered, of chang- ing her mode of life, contributed also to induce her to seek for aid. Her general health had always been excellent, and her family rather remarkable for vigor of constitution, to which she was apparently no exception.

The hands could be readily passed under the tumor, on every side, when the pa- tient was lying on her back, and it could thus be lifted, as it were, from its bed.

This singular circumstance, which I subsequently verified on several occasions, I

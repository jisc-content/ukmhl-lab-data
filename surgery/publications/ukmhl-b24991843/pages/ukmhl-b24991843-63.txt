CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. compression, applied to the external iliac artery by manual pressure, which, as far as I am informed, was not warranted by any precedent. There is a case on record, to which I am not at present able to refer, in which instrumental pressure was successfully applied to this artery for the purpose of restraining hemor- rhage; it was sustained for some time, and although its object was attained, an extensive eschar followed. In 1816, Dupuytren tried systematic pressure, applied half an inch above the crural arch, in a case of in- guinal aneurism, by means of an instrument similar to those at present in vogue, the sacrum being taken as the point of counter-pressure. A second instru- ment, on the principle of the ordinary spring truss, was also employed in the same case. Both attempts were unsuccessful, from the inability of the patient to bear the pain of the pressure, and the disease was subsequently cured by ligature of the artery. (Legons Orales, Paris, 1834, t. iii. p. 540.) The failure in the present instance is attributable to the amount of pain produced by the pressure—to the consequent swelling of the parts situated over the artery—and principally to the spasmodic action of the lower portion of the internal oblique and transver- salis muscles, which rendered it extremely difficult to prevent the artery from rolling beneath the fingers, and thus escaping from even an increased amount of pressure. The first obstacle is not an insuperable ob- jection; my patient bore the pain well, and could have borne it for a longer time; the two latter seem to be inherent in the method employed. With these diffi- culties in view, however, I should not entirely despair of success by this method in a thin subject moderately

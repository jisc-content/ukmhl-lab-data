LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 201 ferred, I find that gangrene occurred in 23 of them, or in 15*4 per cent., and of these three recovered after amputation, the remainder being followed by death. Thus, the danger of gangrene after ligature of the external iliac is nearly twice as great as after the same operation on. the external subclavian- in fact, after ligature of the external iliac, gangrene is to be dreaded as the most frequent cause of death; whereas, in the upper extremity, hemorrhage holds the first place in point of danger. In the four cases in which intra-thoracic inflammation was the cause of death, pleuritis with effusion, pleuro-pneumonia, and peri- carditis. In one of these (Dr. Gross’s case) the sac of the aneurism burst into the cavity of the pleura a month after the operation. This same accident oc- curred in Mr. Bullen’s case, and bloody pus was coughed up in large quantities by the patient, who ultimately recovered. One of the cases fatal by pleurisy was that of Mr. Travers, where the sac was perforated during the operation. I shall not consume the valuable time of the Society any further at present, by a reference to the remain- ing causes of death in detail, but iperely ask atten- tion, before closing, to one or two incidents of more than usual interest. The following unique case, in addition to its novelty, will also serve to show the scanty information to be acquired in relation to some of the fatal cases which I have collected, no other ac- count of it being attainable, save the following par- ticulars: In the minutes of one of the meetings of the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Society, reported in one of the numbers of the London Lancet for 1849, Mr. Bransby Cooper is said to have stated, in connection 14

Ill DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. overdistention in retention of urine, is an example of this. And thus it is explained why forcible dilata- tion or stretching of the anal orifice arrests at once the pain of an irritable ulcer of the rectum, and is followed by its speedy cure. That this result is safe, sure, and reliable, can only be demonstrated by clin- ical facts, and these I will endeavor to furnish. Richard Quain, in his excellent treatise on diseases of the rectum, after stating that the interval that elapses between the evacuation of the bowels and the occurrence of pain varies from ten minutes to two hours, adds: “I cannot explain at all satisfactorily why an interval of time elapses between the applica- tion of the exciting cause and its effect; nor can I account for the variations in its length.” To me it seems plain, that the dilatation to which the orifice of the anus is subjected, by the extrusion of the feces during the act of defecation, is sufficient to prevent the fibers of the sphincter muscle from resuming their full tonic contractility for a short interval; and that the length of the interval depends entirely upon the size and hardness of the mass extruded, and the amount of stretching to which the orifice has been subjected. Now, the operation of forcible dilatation, as I have been in the habit of performing it, by introducing the two thumbs into the anus, flexing them so as to in- clude the breadth of the sphincter muscle, and then, taking a purchase with the outstretched hands from either buttock, drawing them forcibly asunder until arrested by the ischial tuberosities, effects such a stretching of its fibers as to paralyze the sphincter for at least a week, during which time the ulcer

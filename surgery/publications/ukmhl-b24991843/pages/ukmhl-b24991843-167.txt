159 CASES OF DISLOCATION OF THE FEMUR. the extending cord was suddenly cut, but the head of the bone was not reduced. Drs. Cheesman and Buck, who had meanwhile ar- rived at the hospital in attendance upon another case, now joined the consultation, and recognized the feat- ures of the case as I have stated them. At their suggestion the patient was placed upon his side—the side opposite to the dislocation—and the pulleys again applied to the thigh in a flexed position; extension was thus made in a direction at right angles to the pelvis, and counter-extension effected by means of a sheet applied around the pelvis and pulled in the op- posite direction. It was thought that this manoeuvre might be more successful, as the head of the bone lay so far back in the ischiatic notch it would now be dragged more directly forward into the acetabulum. Appropriate manipulation was made use of during extension; and when the cord was cut, the limb being suddenly abducted and extended, we had the gratifi- cation of recognizing, by the restoration of its natural shape and length, that the dislocation was reduced. In consequence of the mobility of the head of the bone and the probable amount of laceration of soft parts around the joint, it was thought advisable to apply the long outside straight splint of a fracture apparatus, and to bandage the limb and pelvis to it, a large pad being at the same time placed behind the trochanter. At the next day’s visit the patient was found free from pain, with a quiet pulse, and both limbs doing well. On September 3d (the twelfth day) the long splint was removed, the hip found free from pain and in-

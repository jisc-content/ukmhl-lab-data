BY A MODIFIED PROCESS. 23 muscles preserved their volume fairly, although they had evidently undergone some degree of fatty atrophy. The femoral artery was pervious, and apparently of full size up to a point about two inches from the ex- tremity of the bone, where it became transformed into a fibrous cord, (B.) The sciatic nerve was con- siderably enlarged, particularly at its extremity, where it is closely adherent to the surface of the bone, oc- cupying, as it were, a valley between two projecting crags of bone, by the growth of which it was constantly subjected to increasing pressure, (A.) This was the spot upon the stump to which most of the pain was attributed before its removal. A few remarks upon the mode of operation, and I will close. Amputation at the hip-joint is one of the few opera- tions in surgery in which rapidity of execution would seem to be absolutely essential to success. Its great dangers arise from shock to the system and loss of blood. The former, it has been seen, was to be ob- viated by the use of chloroform. It was therefore left for me to choose the method of operating by which the limb could be removed with the greatest rapidity, and therefore with the least loss of blood. It is almost unnecessary to remark that the numer- ous modes which have been recommended for the dis- articulation of the hip-joint are merely variations of one of the three principal methods of performing am- putations in general: i.e. of the circular, oval, or flap operations. The former, the operation recommended by Abernethy, for obvious reasons has fallen into dis- use. The oval method, that proposed by Cornuau and Malgaigne, a safe but necessarily a slow operation, has

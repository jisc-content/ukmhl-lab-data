47 CASES OF TRACHEOTOMY. During the sixth week an accident occurred which was near proving serious in its results. On removing the tube one morning, as usual, the clean one happen- ing to be mislaid, a delay occurred in its reintroduc- tion of certainly not more than half an hour, when the house surgeon was much disconcerted to find that, from the contraction of the tracheal opening, he was unable to get it back into its place, even on making use of some force. I was summoned in haste an hour afterward, and found the patient on the eve of suffo- cation; the opening had rapidly contracted to a very small size, and his symptoms were even more urgent than when the trachea was opened at first; his dis- tress in breathing was agonizing, and the by-standers were expecting every inspiration to be his last. With- out a momentâ€™s delay I introduced a curved probe- pointed bistoury, and freely enlarged the opening downward, making sufficient room for the ready in- troduction of the tube, and he was again entirely relieved. This incident in the case is instructive, as showing the singularly rapid contraction liable to occur in wounds of this character when disposed to heal, and prevented from doing so by artificial means. Soon after this circumstance Wheeler passed from under my care, and I was unable to see him except on one or two occasions. I learned that his expecto- ration became more and more difficult, and that he was constantly worried by a harassing cough; hectic fever supervened, with diarrhoea, and he died, worn out and exhausted, about four months after the oper- ation, wearing the tube and breathing with freedom to the last.

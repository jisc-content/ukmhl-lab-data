139 CASES OF YESICAL CALCULUS. was no decided amelioration of the vesical irritation, and little prospect of any while the stone remained in his bladder, it was concluded to remove it at once. This was accordingly done, by the lateral operation, on the 8th December, with the assistance of Drs. Mott, Metcalfe, Isaacs, and J. Thompson, of Hoboken. Chloroform was employed, and with entire success. The calculus, which was about one and three-quarter inches in length, in its longest diameter, was acci- dentally crushed in withdrawal, and this circum- stance rendered it necessary to employ more care in securing all the fragments. There was some hemor- rhage; and as the patient was at a distance from my residence, it was thought safer to leave a sponge and canula in the wound. This was withdrawn in forty- eight hours; and the patient made a rapid and per- fect recovery, uninterrupted by a single unpleasant symptom. In this case, the insuperable objection to lithotrity was the irritable condition of the bladder, which was materially aggravated by the three explorationsâ€”of which the two latter could have been omitted with advantage to the patient. The rapid restoration of the bladder to a healthy condition after the removal of the stone is worthy of remark, especially after the additional manipulation rendered necessary by its breaking into fragments under the pressure of the forceps. The nucleus of the calculus was found to be a mass of uric acid about the size of a large pea; upon this the phosphate of lime and the triple phos- phate of ammonia and magnesia were deposited in strata.

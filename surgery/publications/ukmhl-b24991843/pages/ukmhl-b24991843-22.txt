AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT 14 periphery was everywhere covered by a layer of fibro- cartilaginous material varying in thickness from a line to more than half an inch, filling up its anfractu- osities and giving it a much more uniform appearance of surface than it has at present after maceration. It is now exceedingly irregular in outline, covered by rounded knobs and craggy stalactitiform projections. (See wood-cut.) The condyles, it will be seen, par- ticipate in the alteration. The weight of the tumor when recent was thirteen pounds. The soft parts covering the bony mass were to all appearance per- fectly healthy, with the exception of the alteration consequent upon the pressure of the tumor, and their change of position. The nervous trunks, particularly the popliteal and peroneal prolongations of the sciatic, were observed to be thicker than natural, and had evidently, by their elongation, been subjected to very considerable stretching. From the early part of July, 1848, the period at which he resumed his ordinary occupations, until the same month in the following year, I saw my patient but two or three times. He was enjoying very good health, and complaining of nothing except a very trifling occasional uneasiness in the stump or in the toes of the amputated limb. As this was not an un- usual occurrence, I attached but little importance to his complaints. In the latter part of July, 1849, he called upon me, complaining of increased pain, which was now located entirely in the stump; and, on careful examination, I found to my regret that there was an evident enlarge- ment of the remaining extremity of the femur, appar- ently of the same nature as the original disease.

The flap operation has been justly preferred by the majority of operators and writers, in one of its varieties, viz., by lateral or by antero-posterior flaps, either single or double. Twelve years ago I was taught in Paris that the operation by antero-posterior flaps was the preferable mode; at present both of our teachers of surgery in this city recommend the method by lateral flaps, and it has also been employed in the three instances in which this amputation has been performed here* In favor of the former mode we have the names of Bec- lard, Baudens, Sedillot, Liston, and Fergusson; while Larrey, Guthrie, Lisfranc, and Mott have preferred the lateral flaps. A large proportion also of the favorable results on record have followed the use of the lateral flaps, among which is the last successful case of which I have any knowledge, that of Mayo, of London; this circumstance is explained, however, by the fact that this method has been the one most generally resorted to, as the same proportion holds good in its unsuccess- ful employment. In this division of opinion, on a matter which I believed to be of so much importance to my patient, I betook myself to the dead body, and divesting myself as much as possible of all preconceived preju- dices, determined to ascertain, by repeated trials, by which method I could most safely and quickly disar- ticulate the thigh. I tried the circular, oval, and flap operations in all their varieties, some of them re- peatedly; and finally adopted a method which I have * By Drs. Mott, Hoffman, and Buck.

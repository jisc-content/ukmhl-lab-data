140 CASES OF VESICAL CALCULUS. VII. STONE IN THE BLADDER, OF LARGE SIZE, FORMED UPON A FOREIGN BODY INTRODUCED INTO THE ORGAN—LITHOTOMY—RECOVERY FROM THE OPERATION—DEATH SUBSEQUENTLY FROM THORACIC DISEASE.* J. Brinkerhoff, twenty years of age, bom in New Jersey, was admitted, July 31st, 1853, into Second Surgical Division, (Dr. Van Buren in attendance.) He is a thin, cadaverous-looking young man, of shy man- ners, and apparently of a very low grade of intelli- gence. The history of his case is derived mainly from a letter addressed by his attending physician, Dr. Clias. Hasbrouck, of Schraalenberg, N. J., to Dr. Van Buren, when the patient was committed to his care. The boy had been complaining in an obscure and unsatisfactory way, for several years past; he was evi- dently suffering very constantly, and had grown thin; was solitary in his habits, and exceedingly uncom- municative, so that his parents could get no clew to the cause of his complaints, which he attributed in a vague manner to his urinary organs. Ilis sufferings increased, and he had an attack of hsemoptysis; and finally, under the alarm which the latter symptom gave rise to, he confessed that nearly five years be- fore, a lad with whom he was in the habit of playing, pushed a piece of a slate-pencil, about an inch and a half long, into the orifice of his urethra, that it slipped beyond his reach, and he never saw it * This case is taken, with a few alterations and additions, from the records of the New York Hospital.

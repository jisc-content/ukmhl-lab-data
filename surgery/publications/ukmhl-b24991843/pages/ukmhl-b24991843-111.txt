FIBROUS TUMOR OF TIIE LEFT OVARIUM. 103 respected friend who saw the patient at twelve o’clock m., an hour before, did not hesitate to inform me that things began to look seriously, and that the lancet might be required. There was restlessness, hot skin, pulse of 120, and lancinating pains in the abdomen. At no other visit were there so many unpleasant symptoms present in the case. A grain of morphia was administered at one o’clock, and at the evening visit, when the patient’s condition I felt would decide her fate, I approached her bedside with no little anxiety. She had no pain; a soft, moist skin; a pulse of 106; small pupils, and her respiration was sighing, and 16 in the minute. I recognized in these symptoms that the danger was past, and that she was under the full influence of opium. From this time she did well, and in a few days the opium was discontinued. It seems to me, then, difficult to resist the conclusion that the opium, as well as the chloro- form, had a large share in bringing about the favorable termination of the case. With regard to the statistics of the operation of ovariotomy in our own country, I have knowledge of thirty-six operations performed up to the present time, of which the issue of fourteen has been fatal. Of these, five have been done in this city; three of them, which have never been recorded, terminated fatally from peritonitis; the remainder were perfectly successful, viz., that of Dr. D. L. Rogers, and the case now recorded. ■

CASES OF YESICAL CALCULUS. 123 of the urethra was carried on as rapidly as the state of the bladder would allow, and the latter organ was injected at short intervals with warm water and a so- lution of nitrate of silver. When I had carried the dilatation so far as to al- low the introduction of a No. 12 steel sound, his con- dition was so far improved that I felt warranted in leaving a silver catheter of this size in the bladder for some hours together. This exciting no additional ir- ritation, it was allowed to remain until the urethra suppurated freely; the size of the catheter was, in a few days more, gradually increased to No. 16, the urethral orifice having been incised to a slight extent with the bistoury in order to admit it; and an instru- ment of this size was kept in the passage until it passed with the most perfect freedom. By causing the patient to retain his urine as long as possible, and by distending the bladder to its ut- most capacity with injections, I now endeavored to solicit the escape of the calculus through the urethra thus dilated to its fullest extent,â€”but without suc- cess. I then determined to introduce the lithotrite; and, as the nervous excitability of the patient was still sufficient to interfere seriously with the success- ful employment of this instrument, I decided to ad- minister chloroform during its introduction. In this manoeuvre I was more successful; the bladder was injected, the scoop instrument employed, and with very little delay the calculus was felt, caught, and crushed. On withdrawing the lithotrite, I was pleased to find the fragment of catheter between its jaws; not so much so, however, as the patient was, when he awakened from his sleep to find himself rid of a source of so much apprehension to him.

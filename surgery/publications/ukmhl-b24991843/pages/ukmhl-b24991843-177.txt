169 OF THE TUNICA VAGINALIS. disappeared spontaneously, without any care or treat- ment, and lie remained free from disease until the 5th of July following, when, on jumping from his wagon, the rupture suddenly came down to a very considerable extent, distending the scrotum on the left side, apparently to its utmost capacity. He en- tered the New York Hospital (under the care of Dr. Halsted) about three hours after the accident, suffering excessive pain, unable to stand upright, with a cold, clammy skin, and a feeble pulse. The tumor of the scrotum was globular or somewhat pyriform in shape, excessively tense and painful to the touch, and it re- ceived no impulse on coughing. The patient was constantly nauseated, his teeth were chattering, and he was urgent for relief; his whole condition was that of a person suffering prostration from sudden injury. Warm bath, taxis, and subsequently the application of cold to the tumor were employed without any re- sult; when, at eight oâ€™clock p.m., after consultation, the patient was fully etherized, and, the taxis having been again tried unsuccessfully, the operation was per- formed by Dr. Halsted. On opening the sac, it was found to contain, as was computed at the time, about sixteen or seventeen inches of small intestine, of a very dark color, and the testicle in its usual position behind the gut. The stricture was seated at the neck of the sac, and after its division the gut was success- fully returned. The wound was closed as usual, and a compress and bandage applied. The patient made a good recovery, and, after having been fitted with a suitable truss, was discharged cured, on the 10th of August following. 12

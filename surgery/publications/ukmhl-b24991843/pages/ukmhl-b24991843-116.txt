108 DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. is transformed into an unhealthy and irritable ulcer, which soon becomes the seat of severe and stinging pain of a peculiar character, and singularly dispro- portioned in amount to the trifling extent of the lesion. This disease is well described by Curling, Quain, Ashton, and other writers on diseases of the rectum. The ulcer is generally, although not inva- riably, situated on the posterior wall of the gut, and it takes an oblong shape from that of the fissure in which it has its origin. In many cases its lower ex- tremity can be brought into view by gently forcing apart the borders of the anal orifice. The treatment advised by the authorities above cited for this most painful affection comprises two plans. The first includes laxatives, enemata, and escha- rotics or healing ointments applied directly to the ulcer. If these means do not succeed,—and their suc- cess is a rather rare exception to the rule,—division of the sphincter ani by the knife, as first proposed by the French surgeon, Boyer, many years ago, is the alternative. This remedy is generally prompt and certain; but it is a cutting operation, requiring some little time for recovery, and patients, through exag- gerated fear of the knife of the surgeon, will often continue to suffer rather than submit to it.

I refer to forcible dilatation of the sphincter ani muscle. This process has been employed, I am aware, by several of my surgical friends; but I think that its simplicity,

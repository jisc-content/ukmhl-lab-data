40 CASES OF TRACHEOTOMY. a paroxysm of the suffocating cough. No clicking sound could be heard in the trachea. My conclusion was that the child had a foreign body, probably a plum-pit, in the air-passages, either in the trachea, or impacted in one of the ventricles of the larynx; that the bronchi were free.

Dr. Mott, who was present with Drs. Batchelder and Metcalfe, and a number of students, also examined the patient before the operation, and recognized the presence of a foreign body. I determined to employ chloroform, which was kindly administered by Dr. Metcalfe; the child having been deprived of food for some hours before the opera- tion, with the view of lessening the chance of vomit- ing under the influence of the ansesthesia. The patient having been placed in a proper posi- tion, an incision two inches in length was made, ex- tending from the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage to within three-quarters of an inch of the sternum, involving the skin, fatty layer, and cervical fascia. Immediately beneath this latter, and involved in its meshes, were a number of large veins, which were only avoided by careful dissection, and by pushing them on either side; this exposed the isthmus of the thyroid gland, which was divided, with the deep

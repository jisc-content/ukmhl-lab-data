CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. 54 quarter above Poupart’s ligament, adopting the oper- ative method recommended by Mott. The patient was placed fully under the influence of a mixture of chloroform and ether, (equal parts by weight,) which was kindly administered by my friend, Dr. Metcalfe, who was present, with Professors Mott, Parker, Dr. J.

Adhesion took place in the wound, without any evidence of local inflamma- tion. The limb retained its natural sensibility, but be- came about 5° colder than its fellow, which difference in temperature has persisted, with very little diminu- tion, to the present time.

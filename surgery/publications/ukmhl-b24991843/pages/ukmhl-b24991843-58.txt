With the consent of all parties, and at the urgent desire of the father, I proceeded to open the trachea, which was done in the usual manner, four of its rings being divided immediately below the isthmus of the thyroid gland. After the momentary annoyance of the operation had passed off, the breathing became much more free, and the face and lips resumed their natural com- plexion; the child asked, as well as he could, for drink, which he swallowed with avidity, and also for food, which was given in small quantities. A tube was introduced, and the patient was placed in bed with a good pulse. He continued to breathe freely, with occasional uneasiness, and slept mostly for two hours, when, without any warning, while his father was listening to the sound of his breathing, and congratulating himself upon its perfect freedom, it suddenly ceased, and before he could get to the bedside, the child was dead. No obstruction whatever had occurred in the tube; this had been carefully watched by two of my stu- dents who had remained with the patient for the purpose. No post-mortem examination could be obtained.

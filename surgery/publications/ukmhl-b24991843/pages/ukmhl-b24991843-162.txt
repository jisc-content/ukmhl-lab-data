154 CASES OF DISLOCATION OF THE FEMUR. side, and slightly in advance of it, with the foot everted. At the upper and outer part of the thigh there is a marked concavity; the limb cannot he moved without great pain to the patient, and its rota- tion is very limited. At the upper and inner part of the thigh there is decided unnatural convexity. About two hours and a half after admission, the patient was conveyed to the operating theater and thoroughly etherized, when, on attempting rotation of the thigh, the head of the bone could be recog- nized as occupying the foramen ovale. While an as- sistant was rotating the thigh in a slightly flexed po- sition, with the leg flexed upon it, strong pressure was made over the head of the bone directly outward by the hands placed upon the convexity at its upper and inner portion; and the patient being profoundly under the influence of ether, the head of the bone was felt to move outward, and the movements of rotation and the direct pressure outward being forcibly continued, the head of the bone was felt to glide into its socket with a palpable and audible snap. The deformity at the same moment disappeared, the thigh could be readily approximated to its fellow, and all the natural movements of the joint were restored. The patientâ€™s thighs were bound together by a bandage, and he was reconveyed to his bed. On the next day the patient complained of slight pain about the hip, but the parts presented a per- fectly natural appearance; on the 31st of July he was discharged perfectly well.

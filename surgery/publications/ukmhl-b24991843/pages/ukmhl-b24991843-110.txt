When the remedy, on the contrary, is administered freely but always intelligently,—the state of the pupils, the respiration, and, above all, its influence in keeping- down pain, being closely watched,—I believe that it possesses the power of preventing the development of inflammation, as fully as chloroform will prevent the shock of an operation. In accordance, then, with these views, I attempted the treatment of this case.

The influence of the full dose given on Sunday, (4th December,) the fourth day, at one o’clock p.m., was particularly striking. This was evidently, as will be seen by referring to the record, the critical period of the case; and a highly

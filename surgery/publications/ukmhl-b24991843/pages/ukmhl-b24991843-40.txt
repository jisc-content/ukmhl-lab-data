AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT 32 II. COMPOUND COMMINUTED FRACTURE OF THE FEMUR NEAR THE GREAT TROCHANTER, WITH EXTENSIVE LACERATION OF THE SOFT PARTS—AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT—DEATH.* Eliza Reid, get. 9, was admitted into the New York Hospital on the 5th July, 1853, two hours after being run over by a railroad car, which produced a compound comminuted fracture of the femur, and extensive laceration of the anterior portion of the thigh, the wound extending from two inches below Poupart’s ligament to the knee-joint. No pulsation could be felt in the anterior tibial artery. There was considerable vomiting before admission. Reac- tion having taken place, a consultation was called and amputation at the hip-joint advised, Drs. Cheesman, Buck, and Markoe being present. At ten o’clock p.m., the patient being placed under the influence of sulphuric ether, the operation was performed by antero-posterior flaps, and the wound brought together as rapidly as the safety of the patient would admit. Very little blood was lost during the operation. The patient vomited during the administration of the ether, ejecting some half- digested food which had been taken before the acci- dent. The shock of the operation was excessive; but in two hours the patient had completely rallied under the careful use of stimulants, and, all circum- stances being considered, passed a comfortable night. * From the New York Journal of Medicine, vol. xii., (new series,) p. 151. 0

194 LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. tion on the external portion of the artery comprises 86; and of this number 53 were successful, and 33 died, making a mortality for this operation of 3’83 per cent., or one in 2*6. Thus, to sum up the comparative mortality of the operations on the different portions of the subclavian artery, we have the following result:— Of 8 operations within the scaleni muscles, 7 on the right and 1 on the left side, all were fatal. Of 3 operations upon the artery between the muscles, 2 succeeded and one died. Of 4 ligatures applied below the clavicle, 3 suc- ceeded and 1 died. Of 86 operations upon the external portion of the artery, 53 were successful and 33 died. Making an aggregate of 101 operations and 43 deaths, or 42-5 per cent. Dr. Norris’s table, published in 1845, shows a total of 69 cases and 33 deaths, or a per centage mortality of 47*8. Thus the lapse of seven years has improved the aggregate mortality of the operation more than 5 per cent. This arises from the fact that the fatal re- sults of the operations upon the inner portion of the artery have led to their less frequent performance, and the additional cases are made up of operations upon the external division of the artery, a large pro- portion of which are successful. The ligature of the external portion of the sub- clavian is then the most useful and the most hopeful of good results, and therefore the most interesting of the operations upon the subclavian arteries. I pro- pose to add some data calculated to elucidate the causes of death in the fatal results which have fol-

152 CASES OF DISLOCATION OF THE FEMUR. the surgeon to examine the injured limb with more freedom and satisfaction than where every touch or movement of the part is liable to be followed by out- cry and resistance; and here again we enjoy an ad- vantage in the diagnosis as well as in the treat- ment of a dislocation. My experience in the use of anaesthetics in this class of injuries has convinced me that, in order to secure the full amount of assistance they are capable of rendering, it is necessary to administer the chloro- form or ether to such an extent as to insure profound insensibility and entire muscular relaxation; when not carried to this point, irregular muscular contrac- tions still continue, and may interfere with the suc- cess of the necessary manipulations. When muscu- lar action is thus entirely abolished, the anatomical knowledge of the surgeon will enable him very often, by direct manipulation, to restore the dislocated bone to its natural position, and with a trifling amount of force. An attempt to reduce a recent dislocation by direct manipulation should be, therefore, as a general rule, the first manoeuvre employed by the surgeon after inducing profound anaesthesia; and it is only after the failure of this simple and natural effort that more complicated means become necessary. In the two following cases of dislocation at the hip, the readiness with which reduction was effected is evidently attributable in a great measure to the influ- ence of the ether. The third case presents complica- tions and peculiarities which induce me to place it on record.

186 LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. perspiration. The compression of the subclavian artery which arrested the pulsation in the swollen arm, also diminished the pain sensibly while it was kept up. I was satisfied, as the result of the examination, of .the existence of a diffused false aneurism communi- cating with a wound of one of the arteries of the arm, and, with no guide as to the seat of the wound in the artery, I was satisfied as to the utter impracti- cability of seeking for it in the existing condition of things; and also, as the axillary artery could not be approached without cutting into the aneurismal cavity, I judged that the best course to adopt for the patientâ€™s safety, was to apply a ligature to the main trunk of the limb above the clavicle, and that the sooner this were done the better. My colleague, Dr. Power, and also Dr. Duggan, who were present, agreed with me as to the propriety of this course, and Dr. Mott, who saw the patient with me in the evening, confirmed the result of our judg- ment. The patient in the mean time had morphine in proper quantities, with brandy, beef-tea, and ice. On the next day, Sunday, a ligature was accord- ingly placed around the subclavian artery, just on the outside of the scalenus anticus muscle, in presence of the gentlemen mentioned above and several other medical friends. I was assisted by Dr. Metcalfe and G. T. Elliot, Jr., the former of whom kindly adminis- tered chloroform with the best effect. I encountered no delay in the performance of the operation; and when the influence of the chloroform, which it was necessary to keep up for about ten minutes, had sub-

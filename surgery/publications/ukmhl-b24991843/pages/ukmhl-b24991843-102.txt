FIBROUS TUMOR OF THE LEFT OVARIUM. 94 tion, was the greatly increased thickness of the peri- toneum lining the abdominal walls; this, together with the omental adhesions, and the serum in its cavity—all products of inflammation—would seem to be attributable to the irritation caused by the size of the tumor, and to the somewhat rude attempts of the patient to diminish it by pressure. On turning our attention to the tumor, which the comfortable condition of our patient allowed us to do as soon as she was removed from the room, it was found to weigh, as nearly as possible, seven pounds avoirdupois, and to measure twenty-three inches in circumference. On its surface were two irregularly- shaped commencing cysts, each about the capacity of f*ij, containing ordinary serum. At the point where the pedicle was attached was the knobbed projection, the size of half a billiard ball, which had been felt from the rectum. On laying the tumor fairly open, its structure was, to all appearance, purely fibrous, and that of the knobbed projection was similar in all respects to the rest of the tumor. Its substance was uniformly very dense, permeated by some large venous sinuses, and apparently well supplied with blood-ves- sels, some of which, retaining their contents, made vascular patches on the cut surface; otherwise its color in the interior was of a dead white. Here and there on the cut surface a minute sac, or vesicle, the size of a very small pea, was to be seen laid open by the knife. I may state here that the structure of the tumor has been since examined microscopically by my kind friend, Professor A. Clark, of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, of this city, to whose pathological skill,

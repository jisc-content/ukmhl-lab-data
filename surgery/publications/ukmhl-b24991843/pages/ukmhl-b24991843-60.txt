52 CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. limped for a fortnight afterward, at the end of which time he, one night in bed, accidentally discovered a pulsating swelling in the groin about the size of a hazel-nut. From this period until he came under my notice the tumor had steadily increased, and during the three weeks previous it had almost doubled its size. It was situated immediately below Poupartâ€™s ligament, and presented a lobulated appearance; its contents were entirely fluid. Pressure upon the external iliac artery arrested the pulsations of the tumor and caused it to collapse. The aneurismal thrill was trifling. The patient was otherwise in perfect health. On being informed of the nature of his disease and its only certain remedy, Mr. H. expressed his entire willingness to submit to the necessary operation. During my examination of the tumor, I was struck by the ease with which its pulsation was controlled by accurate pressure of the trunk of the external iliac artery against the pubes; the force of one finger seemed almost sufficient to command it. This cir- cumstance, with the recollection of the success re- cently attained by Prof. Knight, of New Haven, in the treatment of a case of popliteal aneurism by con- tinual manual pressure applied by relays of assistants to the trunk of the femoral artery, induced me to think seriously of the feasibility of employing similar means in the present instance. Pressure by means of an instrument I was satisfied could not be borne; but the apparent practicability of this novel mode of applying it, with the remotest possibility of its success, led me to conclude that I should not be doing justice to my patient were I to neglect the chance, and I ac-

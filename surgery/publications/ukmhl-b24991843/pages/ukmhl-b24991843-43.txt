On consultation at noon, immediate amputation was determined upon; but the place at which it was to be done was left to be de- cided by the result of an examination made while the patient was under the influence of the anaesthetic. The injuries were found to be so extensive, that there seemed to be no alternative save amputation at the hip-joint. The operation differed from the usual method in that the posterior flap was made by cutting from without inward. Owing to sinking of the pulse while the patient was yet on the operating table, the use of the ether was suspended and stimu- lants given. After the operation, the patient became so restless as to be quite unmanageable, complaining of great thirst, etc. Brandy and ice-water were given, with brandy and water per rectum, every half hour. Patient died six hours after the operation. No autopsy could be obtained. In this case the operative process was satisfactory in regard to ease and rapidity of execution and con- trol of hemorrhage; but, like all primary amputa- tions at the hip-joint, almost of necessity fatal.

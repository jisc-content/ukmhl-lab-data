16 AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT friends and students, I removed the disease by ampu- tation at the hip-joint. Of the mode of operation I will speak more fully hereafter; suffice it to say at present that it was satis- factory in all respects. The artery was admirably commanded by Dr. Wood, by compression at first against the pubes, and afterward in the anterior flap; while the hemorrhage from the posterior flap was temporarily arrested by Dr. Isaacs, who also managed the limb, until the bleeding points were secured by ligature. By careful examination it was ascertained that not more than Sx of blood were lost. About twenty ligatures were required. The influence of the chloroform, which was ad- ministered entirely by Dr. Metcalfe, was perfect in every respect. The flaps, which fitted well, were brought together with but little delay, and retained in contact by six points of suture and intervening straps of adhesive plaster; light but sufficiently firm compression was uniformly effected by a single roller. At the time the patient was placed in bed, which was about forty-five minutes after he commenced in- haling the chloroform, his pulse was 68; he was then partially conscious. Half an hour afterward, when his consciousness had entirely returned, it was 75, and perfectly natural in quality. He exhibited no evidences whatever of shock from the operation. Drs. Moore, of Indiana, and Doneghy, of Kentucky, my former pupils, remained attentively with the pa- tient during the ensuing twenty-four hours. By the third day his pulse had increased to 112; but on the

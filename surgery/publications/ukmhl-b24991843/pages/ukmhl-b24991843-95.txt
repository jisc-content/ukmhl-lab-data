87 FIBROUS TUMOR OF THE LEFT OVARIUM. attribute either to elongation of the cervix and body of the uterus, resulting from its having been forced through the narrow osteurn vaginae of a virgin by the superincumbent weight of the tumor, or inasmuch as the patient has never menstruated, the uterus may be congenitally malformed.* * The tumor, moreover, presented neither the ordi- nary shape nor feel of a uterus in a state of proci- dentia; it communicated to the fingers the idea of a long fibrous cylinder, about an inch in diameter. The os was perfectly healthy and natural in appearance, and contained some of the transparent and glutinous secretion of the follicles of the cavity of the cervix.*)* On grasping the uterus, as it lay between the thighs, firmly with one hand, while with the other the abdominal tumor was pushed as far as possi- ble upward toward the diaphragm, no impulse could be recognized as communicated by one hand to the other; and at the time when the greatest amount of force was applied, the two hands were fully eight inches distant from each other, thus affording fair demonstration that the attachments of the tumor to the uterus were susceptible of considerable elongation, which circumstance, taken in connection with the ex- treme mobility of the tumor, rendered it almost cer- tain that the pedicle by which it was attached to the * * Such a malformation, i.e. an uunaturally elongated uterus, is occa- sionally met with; in fact, I have seen an instance within the year, in a young woman who died at Bellevue Hospital, of organic disease of the kidneys, under the care of my friend, Dr. B.

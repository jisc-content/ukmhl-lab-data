OF THE TUNICA VAGINALIS. 175 ceived no impulse when the patient coughed. The patientâ€™s pulse was 60, his surface cooler than natu- ral, his pain constant and severe at the groin, and extending to the small of the back, and the nausea and vomiting urgent. His bowels had not acted for several days; he had taken no medicine; and, owing to the excessive tenseness and tenderness of the tumor, but very moderate taxis had been employed. With his entire consent, he was placed fully under the influence of sulphuric ether, and one fair effort at reduction having failed to make any impression upon the tumor, the operation was performed at once. The sac was opened throughout the greater part of its length, the constricted portion requiring careful divi- sion by the curved bistoury upon a director. A large cylindrical mass of omentum presented itself, deeply indented by the constriction of the sac; and, entirely enveloped by the omentum, a knuckle of small intes- tine was unfolded, presenting a dark port-wine color. The sac contained no fluid. On withdrawing the omentum from the lower of the two cavities into which the sac was divided by its central constriction, the testicle was brought in view, lying at its posterior part. The omentum was adherent to the sac at its constricted portion, whence it was separated by the handle of the scalpel; and also around the proper neck of the sac, from which it was also detached, with very slight bleeding. After dividing the strict- ure at the external ring, a second very tight stricture was found to exist at the internal ring, which re- quired incision before reduction could be effected. Both of these strictures seemed to me to be in the sac itself. The intestine was drawn down, and found

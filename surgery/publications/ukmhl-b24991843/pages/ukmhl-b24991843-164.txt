156 CASES OF DISLOCATION OF THE FEMUR. the dislocated limb was flexed upon the thigh, and the thigh itself slowly and forcibly adducted and flexed upon the trunk, until its anterior surface was brought in contact with the abdomen, the knee being in contact with the margin of the ribs in the right hypochondrium. Meanwhile, by means of the lever- age afforded by the leg, the thigh-bone was being con- stantly rotated upon its axis. While the thigh was thus in a position of forced flexion and adduction, it was slowly and gradually abducted, the knee sweep- ing across the front of the abdomen until it was brought beyond the left side of the trunk into a po- sition of forced flexion and abduction, the rotatory or rocking motion of the femur being still continued. From this position of forced flexion, combined with abduction, the thigh was gradually extended, forcible abduction being still kept up, when, the knee being about on a line with the symphysis pubis, an audible shock was both felt and heard, which marked the return of the femur to the acetabulum. The limb was then fully extended, and all symp- toms of dislocation were found to have disappeared. The two limbs were bandaged together and the pa- tient conveyed to his bed. He recovered without any untoward symptoms, and on the 20th of August was discharged cured.

MALIGNANT POLYPUS OF THE NOSE. 82 were found on right side. The lungs showed decided hypostatic congestion, and contained a number of ob- solete (cretaceous) tubercles; otherwise healthy. Heart slightly hypertrophied. Liver healthy. Gall-bladder distended, and containing a number of biliary concre- tions. Uterus presented several hard, shot-like tumors, containing fluid, situated around the inner edge of the os. These appear to be enlarged glanclulse Nabothij and present the appearance described by Montgomery, as indicating the first stage of uterine cancer. The tumor, which was removed entire, appears to have originated beneath the mucous membrane cover- ing the right inferior turbinated bone, the substance of which had entirely disappeared. From this point it extended into the antrum of the same side, upward into the ethmoid cells, pushing the septum narium in contact with the turbinated bones of the opposite side, where the healthy mucous membrane had con- tracted firm adhesions, protruding into the pharynx posteriorly, and through the' ossa nasi and integu- ments of the face anteriorly, everywhere causing ab- sorption of the bones which opposed its progress. The substance of the tumor, examined beneath the microscope, appeared to consist almost entirely of elongated, spindle-shaped, or caudate corpuscles, containing one or more nuclei. The parts in the vicinity of the point at which the ligature was applied to the artery were carefully dis- sected. Everything here presented a healthy and favorable appearance; the wound was in a great measure consolidated by the effused fibrin in which

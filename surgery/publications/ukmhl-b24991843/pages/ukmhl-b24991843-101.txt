93 FIBROUS TUMOR OF THE LEFT OVARIUM. afterward at intervals. With this trifling exception, the patient was perfectly quiet throughout, and the influence of the chloroform was everything that could be desired. The peristaltic action of the intestines, usually so troublesome to the assistants in operations of this sort, was in our patient not observable; the bowels during the time of their exposure were as quiet and passive as those of a cadaver. The action of the abdominal muscles was hardly noticeable, even during the effort at vomiting. When the peritoneum was first opened, there was a slight gush of serous fluid, of which there seemed to be about oxx in its cavity. The amount of blood that escaped into the cavity of the peritoneum did not probably exceed gij, and this was principally from the veins of the tumor, while being separated from its connections. The quantity was so slight that I did not think it worth while to use the sponge for its re- moval. After the attachments of the omentum to the tumor had been divided, it was noticed by Dr. Wood that there was a double twist in its pedicle, and it was necessary to turn it over, completely, twice, before the broad ligament was recognized in its proper as- pect. This twisting of the pedicle was no doubt owing to the fact that the tumor had been made to revolve on its axis more than once, at some former period, before the omentum had contracted adhesions to it; and these omental adhesions were probably the only obstacle that prevented me from turning the tumor completely over on my first examination of the patient. Another circumstance remarked during the opera-

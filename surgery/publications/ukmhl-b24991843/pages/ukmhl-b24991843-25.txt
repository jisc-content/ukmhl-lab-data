BY A MODIFIED PROCESS. 17 following day it was again below 100, which it has never since exceeded. It was found necessary to con- tinue the opium, as before the operation, but not in any large quantities. After the third day he was allowed to use soup, and gradually to resume a nutri- tious diet. The dressings were not removed until the seventh day, and at this time the edges of the wound were entirely united, except at the angles, which had been purposely kept open. Subsequently one or two other points discharged slightly. The oozing had been, up to this time, unusually free. Quinine was administered after the tenth day, in order to provide against the suppuration which, from so large a wound, I anticipated would be very copi- ous ; but, although about this time his pulse began to be a little more frequent, the discharge in twenty- four hours I do not think at any time reached oii. So moderate was it in fact that, taking into consider- ation the very slight amount of constitutional excite- ment after the operation, and the absence of all evi- dences of inflammation in the stump, I have but little doubt that at least nine-tenths of the wound healed directly by the first intention. On the twenty-first day, before which time the liga- tures had been all removed, our patient sat up in a chair, with but little assistance, while his bed was being made. He suffered occasionally from colicky pains in the bowels, occasioned probably by his opium, and re- quired two or three times a moderate dose of castor oil with laudanum; otherwise he has not experienced an unfavorable symptom since the operation to the present time, a period of not quite six weeks; and I

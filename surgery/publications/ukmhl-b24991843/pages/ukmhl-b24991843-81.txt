CASES OF INGUINAL ANEURISM. 73 In addition to the cases included in the table, there are two others recorded, in which the result was unsuccessful: one by Portal, (Chirurg., t. i. p. 203,) and another by Brown, [Velpeau, Mecl. Oper., t. ii. p. 186.) Thus we have 24 cases of arterio-venous aneurism treated by ligature of the artery between the disease and the heart, in which 23 were unsuccessful, and one only is said to have been cured. And this soli- tary case of cure is the only one included in the table whose authenticity is at all equivocal. It was that of a man exhibited to Roux as a surgical curiosity, at Milan, in Italy, during his visit to that country in 1836, and reported by him, on his return, to the Academie Roy. de Med. of Paris. Velpeau [ut supra) expresses a doubt as to whether the disease was in reality arterio-venous aneurism. In the 22 cases, death followed, as a consequence of the operation, in 12; the result of one case is doubtful, and 9 survived. Of the survivors, one is the case of cure; three underwent amputation; and four were subsequently cured by other means. In the 12 fatal cases, 6 died from gangrene; 2 from hemorrhage; in 3, both gangrene and hemorrhage contributed to the fatal result; and one perished from constitutional irritation. In 9 of the 22 cases, the brachial artery was tied for the disease occurring in the upper extremity. Of these, one is the case of cure; two certainly died, and a third was probably fatal, (Mr. Atkinsonâ€™s.) Of the remaining 5, two underwent amputation, and 3 were subsequently cured by other means, viz., two by liga- ture of the artery above and below the disease, and 6

LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 203 Of tlie 101 cases I have collected, 21 belonged to American surgeons, and 6 out of the 21 were fatal. Here the mortality is below the general average. Of the 21 American cases, 13 belong to New York, and these include the first successful operation on the external subclavian, by Wright Post, in 1817; the second operation ever performed on the internal sub- clavian, by Mott, in 1831; and the first operation ever performed on the left internal subclavian, by Rodgers, in 1846. Eleven of the 13 operations were performed on the outside of the scaleni muscles, and 10 of these were successful.

AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT 28 Dr. Mott performed a modification of Larrey’s opera- tion by lateral flaps, previously tying the artery in the groin, a measure now generally considered un- necessary. I have in years past repeatedly assisted him in performing this operation upon the subject, but with all his tact in such matters, the superiority of the method was not so striking as to induce me to follow it without further investigation, and I was ex- ceedingly gratified to hear him express the opinion that if he ever had occasion to repeat the operation, he should adopt the process which I have described. One principal cause of the difficulty in disarticula- tion and in the detachment of the trochanter is, that it is generally attempted with the long hip-joint knife, an instrument admirably calculated for making the large flaps by transfixion, but the most awkward pos- sible for cutting out the head of the bone, or around the trochanter. To relinquish the long knife, disjoint the bone, and detach the trochanter with a scalpel, and then resume it to complete the remaining flap, would be a more sensible, but necessarily a tedious plan. It would certainly be better to make the flaps with the long knife, and then to complete the opera- tion with an appropriate instrument. Both of these advantages are secured by the method described; and moreover, in it there is no necessity, as in the ordinary operation by antero-posterior flaps, of transfixing the thigh so very near to Poupart’s ligament, for as the bone can be disarticulated with an appropriate instrument, and always wTith certainty and celerity, it is no longer required to expose the joint so extensively in the first incision, which is the only object gained by entering the point of the knife

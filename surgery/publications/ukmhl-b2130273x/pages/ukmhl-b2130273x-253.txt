DISLOCATION OF THE HIP. 243 walls _ (6) While eversion is due to the rotation of the fractured bone on a hinge formed in the anterior cervical wall, shortening is generally due to the obliquities of this hinge. (7) In a well-formed bone the posterior and thin surface of the neck of the bone is prolonged into the cancellous texture beneath the anterior introchanteric ridge, and is the true neck. (8) The posterior inter-trochanteric ridge is a buttress times split off ^ bj wbicb’ wLen imPaeted>this ridge is some- Mr. W.

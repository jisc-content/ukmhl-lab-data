79 VARICELLA—VACCINIA. distinct diseases, both infectious, both causing a characteristic skin affection. He shows from a table that in Leipzig the contagion of varicella is endemic, while that of variola finds only periodically the conditions favourable to its spread. Martineau (“ Petite epidemie de Varicelle,” ‘ L Union Med., 1869, vii, 835) describes several cases of varicella, the incubation period of which was thirteen days. He maintains strongly the well-marked difference separating this affection from variola and varioloid. Wolff (“ Variola, Yariolois, Varicella,” £Deut. Klin.,’ 1869, 61) holds it is in many cases difficult to distinguish, with any certainty, varicella from varioloid. He cites a series of observations, according to which it may be taken for granted that both affections may be started by one and the same infection, and in accordance with this he assumes the affinity of these two forms of exanthem, a view directly in opposition to that of most recent authors. Bolze (‘Arch. f. Derm.,’ i, 318) gives the following case:—A boy, set. 9, was attacked with varicella and nursed by his sister, who was far advanced in pregnancy. Eight days later she gave birth to a child covered with papules of smallpox. The disease was fully developed, and the child died, the mother remaining free throughout. In a note to this case Pick quotes a case of congenital variola in triplets (three boys), the mother, at the time of their birth, being in the decrustation stage of smallpox. One child came into the world dead and somewhat macerated; the two others presented an eruption corresponding to that of smallpox about the sixth or seventh day; one died after a few hours, the other lived two days.

Vaccinia. Numerous papers will be found on this subject in the ‘ Graz, des Hop.’ and the other Erench journals, more especially with regard to the discussions on vaccine in the Imperial Academy of Medicine. Melsem (‘Arch. Gen. de Med.,’ 1870, ii, 242) shows from his experi- ments that cold, about 8o° C. below zero, does not destroy the vitality or the specific action of the vaccine virus.

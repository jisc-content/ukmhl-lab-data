Trans.,’ 1869, p. .389) of a case of hydronephrosis, the history of which he had already published (ib., 1S65, 73), in a boy who died at the age of seven years. The obstruction was found to be due to a congenital stricture ot the right ureter. Edlefsen, “Beitriige zur Kenntniss (ler Eiweisstoffe des Haros, Deut.

Arch.,’ iv, 614) of echinococcus multilocularis of the right supra-renal body, in a man, set. 62, to which he calls further attention (ib., vi, 139). He knows only of one other case, quoted from Perrin by Davaine (‘Traite des Entozoares,’ p. 312), and a doubtful* one re- corded by Risdon Bennett, and quoted by Virchow (‘ Geschwiilste,’ B. iii, s. 92). G. Diseases of the Skin. Colson (‘ Gaz. des Hop.,’ 1869, 89) employs vulcanized india-rubber in “ dartrous” diseases, as a simple compress applied to the affected parts, and covered with a roller bandage, or used as a cap to the head a glove to the hand, &c.

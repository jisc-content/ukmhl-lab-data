REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. 106 evident hallucinations of vision ; saw an enemy before him, hit out at him frantically, raised himself in bed, in spite of a paralysis of both legs, and raged till he fell back exhausted, when he again sang till he gradually became quiet and returned to consciousness. Under the daily employment of warm baths (28° R), supplemented later with cold affusion, and bromide of potassium, the convulsive movements ceased eight weeks after his admission into hospital. During this time he had 252 attacks, the last occurring Nov. 22, 1868. The paraplegia disappeared in December of the same year. Leube (‘Deut. Arch.,’ vi, 273) publishes a case of severe chorea of some years’ standing in a girl of eighteen, which was followed by hysteria, and spasm of the pterygoid muscles of the right side, which lasted for three days. Under treatment with the induced current and arsenic she recovered completely. Bristowe (‘Practitioner,’ 1869, 193) records seven cases of chorea treated by 01. Terebinth., Zinci tSulph., Perr. Carb. Sacck., Arsenic, &c. All appeared to get well by the natural progress of the disease. Murchison (‘Brit. Med. Journ.,’ 1869, ii, 211) gives the case of a girl, set. 15, who was affected with chorea, confined at first to the left side, then becoming general and severe. Bromide of Potassium, Bella- donna, Cannabis Indica, and Sulphate of Zinc were tried in vain, and great improvement followed the use of Liq. Strychuise 11^24, increased to n\6o in the twenty-four hours. Poliowing out the treatment of Lubeski and Zimberlin, Perroud (‘ Lyon Med.,’ 1869, ii, 156) cured a case of chorea in a girl set. 13 (and a case of hysteria with convulsive attacks, in a girl set. 19) with sether- spray applied down the spine: other cases of the same kind are given by Mazade, of a boy, set. 18, under Meynet (ib. 327; and cf. discussion on Perroud’s paper, ib. 333), and by Bose of a girl set. 13 (‘ Lancet,’ 1870, ii, 813). Rodolfi (‘ G-az. Med. ital. lomb.,’ 1S69, 17) cured eight patients suffering from chorea, in from eight to fourteen days, with chloride of lime, given in doses of to 1 gramme daily. The only relapse was arrested by a single application of leeches to the temples.

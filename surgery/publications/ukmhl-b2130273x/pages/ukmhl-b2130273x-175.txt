Affections of the Mouth, Pharynx, and Salivary Glands. Pagan (‘ Brit. Med. Journ.,’ 1869, ii, 489) gives the case of a healthy boy, of two years old, who was affected with pseudo-membranous stomatitis, caused, probably, by his taking milk from a cow with abscess of the udder. Thorne Thorne (‘ Rep. of Med. Off. Priv. Counc.,’ 1869, 294)> from his observations in various towns in England, draws the following con- clusions :—(1) A disease appears sometimes to have been produced in the human subject when the milk of cows suffering from the foot-and- mouth disease has been freely used without being boiled. There is no evidence to show whether this affection is of a specific nature or not; but it seems to consist in a derangement of the alimentary canal, accom- panied by febrile disturbance, the presence of vesicles on the mucous membrane of the mouth and tongue, which, having been ruptured, leave superficial ulcerations, and, at times, an herpetic eruption about the exterior of the lips. (2) In a very large number of cases the milk of cows undoubtedly affected has been used without producing any notice- able morbid effects. This absence of result may, though only to an in- considerable extent, have been due to the smallness of consumption and the boiling of the milk. Thorne does not find that any disease in the human subject has been attributed to the use of the flesh of animals suffering from the same disease.

LITHOTOMY. 253 sary, as would be required for the formation of an altogether abnormal substance like oxalic acid. These considerations may also explain the much greater prevalence of stone amongst the children of the poor than of the rich. Children, if properly clothed, fed and kept clean, have the natural constituents of their urine so duly proportioned, that no materials are available for the formation of urinary concretions, and the digestive functions will be little likely to be so far impaired as to give rise to any substance of a calculous nature. The children of the poor, on the other hand, are exposed to the very conditions most likely to give rise to stone. An insufficient and almost arrested cutaneous excretion, from imperfect clothing and uncleanliness, tending to disturb the due proportions of the normal constituents of the urine leading to an abnormal excess of one or more; while the digestive functions are constantly deranged, and tend to give rise to abnormal constituents of a calculous nature. The author had not heard of a case of stone in childhood among the upper classes. In later life stone is at least as common among the rich as among the poor. This may perhaps be accounted for by the prevalence of the various forms of dyspepsia consequent on luxurious diet. In remarking on lithotomy, the plan of lifting the staff well against the roof of the urethra, as the finger is passed in, is recommended. Notes of twenty cases of lateral lithotomy in boys, all of which were successful, are given. (‘Brit. Med. Journ.,"’ May 15, 1869.) Lithotomy.—Mr. Holmes relates a case in which, after cutting into the bladder, he could find no stone, and considers that it had fallen to the ground with the first gush of urine. He alludes to other cases. (‘ Clin. Soc. Trans.,’ ii, p. 67.) Statistics of lithotomy.—In the ‘Brit. Med. Journal,’ March 20, 1869, will be found some interesting statistics of cases of lithotomy by Dr. Keith, giving his experience for thirty years. We extract the first table. Ages and Results. Cases.

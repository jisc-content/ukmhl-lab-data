AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN. 179 (e) Carcinoma.—Mettenheimer (‘Deut. Arch.,’v, 439) publishes a case of carcinoma in a girl, aet. 20. The chief mass was found < in Glisson’s capsule, and in the ligaments between the liver on one side aud the stomach and small intestines on the other. In addition there was carcinoma of the stomach, gall-bladder, &c. Willigk (‘ Yirch. Arch.,’ xlviii, 524) found, in a man, set. 64, a growth of connective tissue surrounding the bile-ducts, with recent medullary cancer. From the history he thinks it was originally set up by the pressure of a gall-stone, and records the case as an occurrence of can- cerous new growth in consequence of local irritation.

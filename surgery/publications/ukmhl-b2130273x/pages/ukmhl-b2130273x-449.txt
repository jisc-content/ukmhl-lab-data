439 THE CHILD : VACCINATION. on in Paris, Brussels, Rotterdam and Amsterdam, in 1869. With, reference to the transmissibility of cow-pox unimpaired from calf to calf the evidence is conflicting. M. Lanoix said that since he first brought his calf from Naples in 1864 he had never failed to continue the disease by inoculation. It appears, however, that a certain amount of skill is necessary, for M. Warlomont states that now he succeeds perfectly, whereas at first his unsuccesses were so numerous that, had he been determined by his first year’s work, he could not but have abandoned the practice. Moreover, at Rotterdam Dr. Bezeth reports that after two or three months the eruption on the calf became much less pronounced, and the results on the human subject were frequently imperfect and abortive; fresh lymph was obtained, which in every case seemed to undergo a similar deterioration, resulting in these constantly and almost periodically renewed features, for which there must be some cause other than the peculiarities of the animals used. The character and cow'se of the poclcs produced on children by animal vaccine lymph were carefully studied in Paris and Rotterdam. The pocks had the same character, ran the same course, and manifested the same varieties as Dr. Seaton was in the habit of seeing produced at the public vaccination stations in England. In order to enable us to arrive at a conclusion as to the comparative success of vaccination with animal and with humanised vaccine lymph, the author gives the following results of the two modes of practice on children in the Paris hospitals, from the 1st of October, 1867, to the 30th of October, 1869, inclusive, and in Rotterdam for the year 1869 : Paris— From heifer to arm From arm to arm Rotterdam— From heifer to arm From arm to arm Proportion per cent.

If practised and most scrupu- lously careful vaccinators, anxiously endeavouring to make their expe- riment successful, and neglecting no known precaution for the purpose ind after two years experience that in vaccinating direct from the to the ari? they are obliged, in one eighth of their cases, to vacci- nate a second time before they can produce any effect, and that in the end very nearly one fourth of the children who are infected in this way

419 LABOUR : THE PELVIS. bercle rose to the height of one line for a length of i\"' to an edge as sharp as a knife; a little further outwards a spine springing from a small base and nearly 2"' long pointed towards the sacral region. (It does not appear that these sharp ridges or spines were the cause of lace- ration of the soft parts. The case is interesting as showing the imper- fection of Scanzoni’s cephalotribe. A good model, such as we now possess in England, would not slip. There are three modes by which delivery may be effected with a pelvis of even lesser dimensions than this one, with safety and with comparative ease, viz. by crushing and extracting with a good cephalotribe, by picking off the bones of the cranial vault, and seizing by the craniotomy forceps the edge of the base of the face, and by reducing the head by sections by the wire- eeraseur.—E. B.) Dr. 0. von Eranque describes (£ Scanzoni’s Beitriige,’ 1869) the form of the pelvis in different races. He points out that the materials are very scanty. His memoir is based on the examination of—1. The pelvis of a flat-headed Indian of Vancouver’s Island. 2. The pelvis of a Malay woman. 3. The pelvis of a Chinese woman. 4. The pelvis of a Negress. 3. The pelvis of a Papuan Negress of the Philippine Islands. 6. The pelvis of a Negress (?) from America; and with these he compares the pelvis of a female Gorilla. The first four and the Gorilla belong to the Wurzburg museum. He first reviews the history or literature of the subject, citing the observations of Soemmering, 1785, Camper; Dr. Eollin who accompanied La Verouse, 1797; v. Siebold, 1821; Vrolik, [820; M. J. Weber, 1839; J- Muller, 1834; Kilian, 1833; Lusch, 1838; Hyrtl, 1833; Struthers, 1833, who de- scribes the Esquimaux pelvis ; E. Zaaijer, 1862, describes twenty Malay pelves; Joulin, 1864, describes the pelvis of a Negress, comparing it with that of the anthropomorphous apes; C. Martin, 1866, examined the pelvis of many varieties of race in the living; Goertz, 1868, de- cribes the pelvis of a Bushwoman. He uses the descriptions of other authors as well as his own. The form of the brim of the pelvis is somewhat asymmetrical and longish oval. Starting with the European pelvis as a standard :— European pelvis Flat-headed Indian Esquimaux Malayan .

This is seen in the above table. The two diameters are nearly alike in the Papuan, but still the transverse is the longer. The excess of. the autero-posterior diameter in the Gorilla is very marked. The Gorilla pelvis is striking by its elongated oval form. If compared with human pelves the differences of the Gorilla, as well as other an-

The reciprocal of any number is the result of dividing unity by that number. The numbers are contained in the columns marked n, the reciprocals in the columns marked i/«. By means of this table all the calculations required for the employ- ment of lenses are much facilitated, as will be shown by the following examples. We often wish to know to what single lens two others are together equivalent. Two cases present themselves : . 1, —Lenses of the same Jcind.—To what lens would the combination of No. io with No. 6 be equivalent P The reciprocal of io is oaoo,000,000 „ 6 „ 0-166,666,667 Added together 0-266,666,667 On turning to the column i/n, we find this sum to be the reciprocal of 3I. This would be the number of the lens equivalent to the union of 6 with 10. 2. —Lenses of different Icinds, one concave, the other convex.—What is the equivalent of 7 convex with 21 concave? The reciprocal of 7 is 0-142,857,143 „ 21 „ 0-047,619,048 Subtracting the lesser from the greater, we have 0-095,238,095; which, sought in the column 1 jn, is found as the reciprocal of io|. As the reciprocal of the convex lens is the larger, the resulting lens is also convex; and if the 7 had been the concave, the resulting 10^- would have been concave. When the sum or remainder is not exactly to be found in the column 1 In, we take the nearest number, unless there is an indication for select- ing a weaker or a stronger lens. Thus, if we seek the equivalent of 14 concave with 19 convex— The reciprocal of 14 is 0-071,428,571 » 19 » 0,052*631,579 Leaving a remainder of 0-018,796,992 This number is intermediate between the reciprocals of 53 and 54, but nearer to the former, and we therefore take 53 concave, unless there be some reason for choosing a weaker lens, in which case we should take 54. Many questions in optics contain the formula +— =— + — . It • .„ — <P V q is manifestly very easy to solve them by reciprocals. Thus, the first case stated becomes to + b — tV 5 and the second is either a — 2t = *2T", or, as the case may be, 2A- — A. = — -ST. If we wish to find a lens one sixth the strength, say of 3I-, we find the reciprocal of 3^ = o-285,7i4,285. One sixth part of this is = 0-047,619,047, which is found as the reciprocal of 21 ; so that six lenses of 21 are equivalent to one of 3I-. The table will be found very useful in prescribing for astigmatism. Suppose a case in which a patient requires No. 10 convex for one chief

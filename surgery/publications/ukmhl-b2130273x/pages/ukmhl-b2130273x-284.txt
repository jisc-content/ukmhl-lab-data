274 REPORT ON SURGERY. The second case, that of a girl aged seven, recovered well, and when the last note was made she could stand and walk on the limb well. Diseases of the knee-joint are discussed November 6, 20, December 4. Disease of the knee; operative interference. — In the ‘ Lancet,’ January 8, 1870, is an abstract of a paper read by Mr. Bryant before the Medical Society of London, on the subject of the treatment of disease of the knee-joint, more especially with reference to operative interference. He began by stating that, as a rule, no operative inter- ference was necessary in inflammatory disease of the knee-joint without disorganization. When suppuration has taken place and disease of synovial tissue, a cure by natural processes, assisted by art, is generally to be secured. When the disease begins in the bone, operative measures are demanded. A cure by anchylosis is by no means uncommon in the former case. During the acute stage danger to life is great, and the question arises whether or not to amputate to save life. As a rule, amputation or excision for acute suppurative disease is generally fatal. Mr. Bryant prefers making free incisions into the joint, and washing out with warm water. He thought this ought to precede other operations. Notes of two cases in which sequestra had been removed from the articular extremity of one of the bones forming the knee, with recovery with anchylosed joints, and one in which amputation had to be per- formed, are noted. In disorganization of the joint the choice lies between amputation and excision. Mr. Bryant has tabulated 188 am- putations of the thigh for chronic disease of the knee-joint; Dr. McCor- mack 137, making a total of 325 ; of these, 66 died, and 259 recovered. The mortality being 20 per cent., or 1 in 3. In Dr. Hodge’s work are noted 178 cases of excision of the knee for chronic disease; 70 died, and 108 recovered. The mortality being 39 per cent., or 1 in i\. Mr. Swain states that up to 1865 excision had. been performed in 316 cases ; 83 died, or per cent.; 9 of these having died after amputation, which was necessary in 39 cases. Since 1863, 74 cases are given, 23 of which died, or 337 per cent.; 4 also died after amputation, which was necessary in 11 cases; making a total of 29 out of 74, or 39 per cent. Mr. Swain also gives a select list of 82 ; 13 died, 4 of the others recovered after amputation. We thus have 472 excisions, with 129 deaths, a mortality of 277 per cent., 13 of these being after amputa- tion. If, however, the results of both operations are considered, at different periods of life (a point of immense importance), the following striking results come out. In the amputations in patients under 20 years of age, of 69, 3 only died, being 4.3 per cent., or 1 in 23. In excisions, out of 97, 27 died, or 27^ per cent., (1 in 3f-.) In amputa- tions between the ages of 21 and 40, out of 119, only 38 died, or 32 per cent., or 1 in 3. In excisions, out of 74? 39 died, or 32’7 Per (more than x in 2). The difference being 20 per cent, against excision. Admitting excision to be a good operation, do the advantages justify the extra risk P JMr. Bryant thought not. He also considered an eaily operation the most successful. It should not be performed when an operation is demanded to save life, only when local disease is steadily progressing in spite of treatment. Mr. Bryant, in conclusion, liopec

Seidel (£ Deut. Klin.,’ 1869, s. 17) gives an account of seven cases of typhus occurring in the clinique at Jena, four of which were suffering from the disease on admission, the other three taking it in hospital. Al°l the seven were of a severe type, and three died. There were no essen- tial differences in the usual symptoms, though the temperature in the several cases presented such variations that in one he declares it would have been impossible to make a diagnosis from this alone. The spleen was enlarged in all, in sis considerably so. The comparison of the urine in the several cases gave no positive results; in all but one it contained albumen, in some a large amount, in others only traces for a longer or shorter time. Vital, in a long paper on the epidemic of typhus in the province of Constantine in 1868 (‘ Gfaz. Med. de Paris,’ 1869, p. 85, &c.), considers it to have been a continuation of that which reigned in Algiers in 1861 and 1862, breaking out in the town of Constantine in the spring of 1863, and raging for several months, especially among the Jews. In 1867, under the influence of the famine caused among the Arabian population by the bad harvests, it spread so enormously that the vic- tims to it, throughout the whole of Algeria, might be counted by hun- dreds of thousands ; and as this miserable condition forced them into the midst of the Europeans, the epidemic broke out at numerous points among the civil population as well as in the garrisons, establishing be- yond doubt its frightful property of contagion. Of 1273 patients treated in the hospitals and ambulances, 330 died; the autopsies showed ecchy- moses in the pia mater, connective tissue, muscles, pleura, and perito- neum ; thrombi of the spleen and lungs, and flabby heart. The disease was complicated in some cases with pneumonia, diarrhoea, and diphtheria; its symptoms and course seem to have offered nothing extraordinary. (With this paper, cf. Arnould, “ Origines et affinites du Typhus d’apres l’epidemie Algerienne de 1868,” ib., 1869, p. 604, &c., and 1870, p. 164.) Kussell (‘ Grlasg. Med. Journ.,’ 1869, i, p. 269) gives two cases of fatal typhus, with rare complications:—one in a boy, set. 3 years, with ex- tensive meningitis, without tubercle in any organ; another in a man, set. 45, with parotid inflammation and thrombosis of the left femoral vein, causing phlegmasia dolens. He publishes another case (ib., p. 41 !), in a man, set. 32, which proved fatal from intestinal capillary haemor- rhage, blood being vomited and passed per anum, and death from col- lapse taking place on the fourteenth day of the disease. This was only the second case of the kind that had occurred in between 3000 and 4000 typhus patients in Glasgow. The same author, in conjunction with Coats (ib., 489), gives four cases, with histories and tables in full (one

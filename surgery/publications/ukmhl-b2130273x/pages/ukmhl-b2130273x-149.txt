Bronchitis and Emphysema. Lebert (‘Deut. Arch.,’ vi, 74) gives a full summary of all the recorded cases of— (1) acute fibrinous bronchitis without fibrinous expectoration ; (2) the same affection with fibrinous expectoration; (.3) fibrinous pneumonia; (4) chronic fibrinous bronchitis- (c) chronic symptomatic bronchitis; and ends his paper with his own con- clusions in full as to these affections. Waldenburg (‘Berk klin. Week.,’ 1869, p. 208) publishes a case of croup of the bronchi in a girl set. 8±, who since her fourth year had been in the habit of expectorating, every second day, with great straining, firm regular masses, which under water spread out into tree-like dichotomously branched forms, from three to four inches loner iJie child was ordered whey, and in addition inhaled lime-water from&a steam pulverisateur for a quarter or half an hour daily. After forty-five inhalations the child was well and remained so for a year, and then on catching a severe cold, expectorated the mucous sputa of simple ronchitic catarrh. The child seems also to have had impetigo capitis and the author makes the suggestion whether there was in this case brn®WaTcm,pa connect“m between the s!li“ eruption and the Armand (■ Lyon Med.,' 1870, ir, 544), at the autopsy of a man who had expectorated for some tune fibrinous casts of the bronchi found the after filled with gelatinous filaments, their mucous membrane red and hypersemic, but not presenting any ulceration.

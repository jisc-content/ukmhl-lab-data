163 MALFORMATIONS.—AN EURISM. An hour and a half after the last inhalation the patient died. He was found to have advanced aortic and mitral disease.

Congenital Malformation of the Heart, fyc. During the last two years a great number of specimens of malfor- mations of the heart and large vessels has been shown at the Patholo- gical Society of London ; among others, by Wagstaffe (‘ Path. Soc. Trans.,’ xix, 96) ; Pox (ib., 104) ; Church (ib., 147, 188) ; Greenhow (ib., 159; xx, 98; xxi, 86) ; Kelly (ib., xix, 185 ; xxi, 89) ; Green (ib., xix, 188); Peacock (ib., xx, 87; xxi, 78, 89) ; Hickman (ib., xx, 88, 93); Semple (ib., xxi, 80) ; and Koyds (ib., xxi, 83). Peacock parti- cularly contributes (ib., xx, 61) a case of atresia of the orifice of the pulmonary artery in a girl set. 13 years, the aorta communicating with both ventricles. He remarks upon this species of malformation, and gives two tables of collected cases, the first, in which the septum ventri- culorum was complete (eight cases); the second, in which it was imper- fect (twenty-six cases). Kelly (ib.,xxi, 91) also gives a case of disease of the mitral valve during intra-uterine life. Other cases are recorded by Bohn (‘Angeborene Stenose und Insuf- ficienz der Arter. Pulmon. bei einer Erwachsenen,” ‘ Deut. Arch.,’ v, 436), and v. Thaden (“ Missbildung des linken Herzkammer,” ‘ Zeitschr. f. rat. Med.,’ xxxiii, 58). And a paper by Walkhoff bearing more or less on the same subject (“ Das Gewebe des Ductus Arteriosus und die Obliteration desselben”) may be found in the last volume (xxxvi, 109) of the latter periodical, now discontinued on account of Pfeufer’s death.* A notice of an “ adult heart without ventricular septum,” in the Newcastle Pathological Museum, appears in the ‘ Brit. Med. Journ.,’ 1870, ii, 190. Sawyer, “Malformed Heart in a boy, mt. 10,” ‘Brit. Med. Journ.,’ 1870, ii, 691 • Balthazar Foster, “Mitral and Tricuspid Stenosis,” ib., 591. Aneurism. The three following cases so much resemble one another that room alone for them must be found, among a number of abstracts. liindheisch and Obernier (‘ Deut. Arch.,’ v, 6.39) give the case of a man set. 65, who in May, 1867, presented symptoms diagnosed as due to aneurism ol the ascending aorta. In March, 1868, there was great cyanosis, distinct venous pulse in neck and liver; increase of heart dulness to the right; a blowing systolic murmur over the whole cardiac region, most distinct between the insertions of the two fifth cartilages; * Henle’s ‘ Schlusswort ” (ib., 277) regarding his co-editor and their concluded by Pfeufer’s death, deserves reading.—A.

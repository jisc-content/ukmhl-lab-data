The quantity of watery vapour un- derwent considerable absolute variation, but the proportion discharged from particular regions remained tolerably constant, so that, taking an equal surface of the cheek (lined by the moist mucous membrane of the mouth), the volar surface of the hand, and of the forearm, the quantities were expressed by the numbers 100: 90 : 45. Leubef establishes the presence of urea in the perspiration of both healthy and diseased persons, and shows that the skin acts, to a certain extent, vicariously to the kidneys in the discharge, not only of urea but of phosphoric acid and chlorine. W. MarcetJ has made a series of observations on the temperature of the body at different heights when at rest, and during the ascent of Mont Blanc. A similar essay by M. Lortet will be found in the ‘ Comptes Rendus’ for Sept. 20th, 1869, and ‘Student,’ 1869, p. 271.

REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. 146 regions would probably have led to a permanent cure in all. He con- cludes that elevated regions deserve greater attention as summer, but also and even more so as winter, health-resorts ; they offer great advan- tages in many cases of early consumption, or of tendency to consump- tion, in the disposition to catarrhal pneumonia, and the results of this disease, particularly the so-called tubercular (cheesy) deposits and tubercular (pneumonic) infiltrations; that in such cases fresh catarrhal and other acute intercurrent affections appear to be less frequent in health-resorts at high than at low levels; that in elevated regions the tendency to absorption and fibrous transformation or cicatrization of pneumonic deposits is promoted, while the tendency to the rapid break- ing down of tissue and the formation of cavities is counteracted; that the tendency to haemoptysis is diminished, not, as is usually believed, increased.

EBPOET ON MIDWIFERY AND THE DISEASES OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN. BY ROBERT BARNES, M.D., E.R.C.P. I. GYNAECOLOGY, EMBRACING THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF THE NON-PREGNANT STATE. Anomalies of Structure. Pificlity of the uterus is illustrated by Dr. Scbatz, who describes and figures four new cases of incomplete division of the genital canal in women, and three of one-horned uterus (‘Arch. f. G-ynak.,’ 1870). By Dr. Bailly’s case of bifid uterus. The patient died in the service of M. Depaul at the Clinique. The placenta had adhered partly to the septum between the two uterine cavities. This septum being unable to contract, like the normal uterine walls, was, M. Bailly thought, the cause of the haemorrhages (£ Bull, de la Soc. Anat.,’ 1867). A case of bilocular uterus, diagnosed during life, is related by Dr. Routh (‘ Obstetr. Trans.,’ 1870). The subject menstruated at 15-^ years.

A sound was passed into each uterine cavity, when the two sounds were found not to touch, having the septum between them. Absence of vagina, retention of menses.

There was no vagina, but a sort of caecum. Per anurn the. finger came across a tumour the size of a child’s head, fluc- tuating, in one part apparently very thin.

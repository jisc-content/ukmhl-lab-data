492 ItEPOltT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. towards the perfection of a system; they are given as the commence- ment of a study to be pursued in a certain direction, which it will take many years of research to elaborate. I would not have it concluded when on any occasion in the future the parallels may not have fallen exactly as I have described them to occur during the present period that the deductions from the facts as I have stated them are incorrect. Parallels do not fall except by the intervention of natural agencies, and it is these agencies which are to be studied, as well as the part played before us by the object cholera. I do not insist upon the absolute stability of parallels, but upon the truth that epidemic cholera shall play its part, side by side, with natural agencies; and if at any time it may appear that the order of things is broken, I think we shall do well if we mistrust our judgment and try to read the facts over again, under the conviction that it is far more likely that our data are deficient, or our appreciation of them wrong, than that the subordination of the epidemic cholera to natural laws has been removed. We have found the same truth persistent throughout this inquiry, not that the epi- demic had a certain geography, a certain course, and a definite date of appearance, in virtue of the fact that it was an invading epidemic, but we have found one and all of the manifestations of epidemics to vary precisely as they ought to have varied, to have been deferred and to have been accelerated, to have been repelled and to have been urged for- ward, to have left certain areas unoccupied and to have occupied others, under the guidance and control of an unerring agency. It is true that we shall for a long time to come recognise truths regarding cholera as an epidemic during or after the occurrence of the events as in anticipation of them, but the time may come when the anticipation of events will be the rule, and failure to anticipate them the exception. The stability of the standard here attempted rests on the truth of the three asser- tionsâ€”that the cholera provinces are the natural provinces of this presidency, and will remain so in all time to come; that cholera has a distinct existence as an organised object, in subordination to which the phenomena of reproduction, dormancy, and final decay occur; and that the control of vital manifestations and also of epidemic progress is exercised by the meteorological agencies prevailing within geographical areas, which in this presidency we can clearly recognise and define, but which for countries beyond Hindostan have yet to be framed. It is the special physical geography of Hindostan, the perfection of the regularity with which the seasons come forward year after year, and the normality of the limit of meteorological agencies in every year, that causes its surface to become mapped out into natural areas. Limits there are of natural areas within the geographical limits of our presi- dency, but its geographical boundaries are not the limits of the spread of aerial influences. The western limit to the province covered when our spring cholera is thrown over Eastern Africa, or the eastern limit of the air-borne cholera progressing beyond our north-eastern frontier, has never yet been defined; and I have shown that Persia is only a halting stage in the first year of their career for the epidemics of our north-western provinces traversing the northern epidemic highway leading out of the Bengal Presidency towards the west.

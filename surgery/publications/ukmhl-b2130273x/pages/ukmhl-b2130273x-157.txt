147 DISEASES OE T1IE LUNGS. Salter (‘Lancet,’ 1869, ii, 1) -publishes a clinical lecture on a case of the same kind in a man sct. 43, in whom the right lung was found, with the exception of a small portion of the base, to be converted into a mass of cancer. Beveridge (‘ Med. Press and Circ.,’ 1869, i, 4.52') records a case ot sudden death from haemorrhage into the trachea, &c., in a man set. 64, from cancerous deposits in the lungs, one of which had ulcerated through into a bronchus. Moxon (‘ Path. Soc. Trans.,’ xx, 28) records a case of cancer of the lower lobes of both lungs in a man, aet. 48, who had epithelial cancer of the anterior wall of the oesophagus passing through into the trachea. He holds that this was a case of extension of cancer from the progress of its germs down the bronchial tubes. Bennett, “Lectures on the Natural History and Diagnosis of Intrathoracic Cancer,” ‘Brit.

Diseases of the Circulatory System. ' Origin of Cardiac Murmurs, Sfc. Peris (‘Deut. Arch.,’ v, 381) gives a series of measurements with especial reference to the size of the aortic and pulmonary artery orifices, and the changes in them at different ages. Following Norman Chevers in the view that the aortic orifice is not to be looked upon as a simple opening, but a cylindrical canal, bounded below by the fibrous ring, within which the convexities of the semilunar valves are attached (ostium cardiacum), and above by the insertion of their edges (ostium arteriosum), he concludes from his measurements that the ostium cardia- cum is wider than the ostium arteriosum in children under sixteen. In subjects under forty, also, the ostium cardiacum is almost without excep- tion wider than the ostium arteriosum, while above that age the opposite condition is almost constant. The same relation in the width of the

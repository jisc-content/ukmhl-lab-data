126 PREFACE. the whole subject, and substituted the clear distinctness of the day for the obscurity and uncertainty of twilight. His view was always large and comprehensive; and by combining these new discoveries with what was known before, he deduced without difficulty laws which had eluded previous research, and then verified his deduc- tions by a further observation and a more extended ex- periment. It is more to the activity of his inquiries than to the strength of his reasoning powers that we owe his discoveries. Indeed, his powers of reasoning were scarcely on a level with his other faculties ; but the errors of his logic were perpetually corrected by the variety and accuracy of his experiments. Now it so happens that in the Venereal Disease he had little opportunity for the exercise of his usual means of investigation. Experiments on animals are impos- sible in this case, as the disease seems to be confined to the human species. Dissections give little information, for the virus itself altogether eludes our sight; and such of its effects as are not obvious, are for the most part too minute to be distinguished by the eye. As most syphilitic symptoms occur in parts which are superficial and exposed to view, their general form and character have long been familiar to surgeons: the minuter changes are not discoverable by simple inspection, nor easily demonstrable to the senses. The casual observations of every day were open to John Hunter as to others, but he was exposed to the same difficulties which had checked the progress of his predecessors, and was liable to be misled by the same causes of error. In the Vene-

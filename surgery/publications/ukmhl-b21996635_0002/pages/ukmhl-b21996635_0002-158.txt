PART I. CHAPTER I. OF THE VENEREAL POISON. rr JLHE Venereal Disease arises from a poison, which, as it is produced by disease, and is capable of again producing a similar disease, I call a morbid poison, to distinguish it from the other poisons, animal, vegetable, and mineral. The morbid poisons are many, and they have different powers of con- tamination. Those which infect the body either locally or constitu- tionally, but not in both ways, I call simple. Those which are capable of affecting the body both locally and constitutionally, I call compound. The venereal poison, when applied to the human body, possesses a power of propagating or multiplying itself; and as it is also capable of acting both locally and constitutionally, it is a compound morbid poi- son. Like all such poisons, it may be communicated to others in all the various ways in which it can be received, producing the same disease in some one of its forms. §. 1. Of the first Origin of the Poison. Though the first appearance of this poison is certainly within the period of modern history, yet the precise time and manner of its origin has hitherto escaped our investigation, and we are still in doubt whether it arose in Europe or was imported from America. I shall not attempt to discuss this question; and those who wish to examine at length the facts, authorities, and arguments brought in favour of the latter opinion, may consult Astruc; and for the former, a short treatise * published in 1751, without a name. The author of this treatise appears to have * Intitled “A Dissertation on the Origin of the Venereal Disease; proving that it was not brought from America, but began in Europe from an epidemical Distemper. Translated from the original Manuscript of an eminent Physician. London, printed for Robert Griffiths, 1751.”

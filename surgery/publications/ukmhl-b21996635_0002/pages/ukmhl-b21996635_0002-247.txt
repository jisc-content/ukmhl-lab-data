q 2 PART III. CHAPTER I. OF DISEASES SUPPOSED TO ARISE IN CONSEQUENCE OF VENEREAL INFLAMMATION IN THE URETHRA OF MEN. The gonorrhoea produces, or at least is supposed to produce, besides those disorders already mentioned, many others which are totally differ- ent from the original disease. How far they do all or any of them arise in consequence of this disease, is not clear; but as they are diseases of the urethra, and are both numerous and important, I mean to treat fully of them in this place. If any of these diseases arise from a gonorrhoea, they are most probably not the consequences of any specific quality in the venereal poison, but are such as might be produced by any common inflammation in those parts, as was observed of the continued sym- ptoms. In this investigation we shall find some of the complaints arising out of each other, so that there is frequently a series of them. Thus a stricture of the urethra produces an irritable bladder, a frequent desire to make water, increased strength of the bladder, a dilatation of the urethra between the bladder and stricture, ulceration, fistulee in perinaeo, dilatation of the ureters and enlargement of the pelvis of the kidneys, besides other complaints that are sympathetic, such as swellings of the testicle, and of the glands in the groin. I shall treat of the diseases of those parts in the order in which they most commonly arise. It may be observed that most of these diseases, especially the dimi- nution of distensibility in the bladder, attack men advanced beyond the middle age, although many, if not all of them, are at times found in younger subjects, and the circumstance of their appearing at this period arises probably in some degree from a long habit of an unnatural mode of life producing many diseases, such as gout; for certainly such com- plaints do not so frequently take place among the more uncivilized na- tions. The most frequent disease in the urethra is an obstruction to the pas-

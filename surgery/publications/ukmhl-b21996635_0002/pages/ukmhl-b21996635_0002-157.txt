The Peruvian bark, confectio cardiaca, serpentaria, &c., have been given in as large quantities as the case ap- peared to require, or the constitution could bear: by which means an artificial or temporary appearance of strength has been produced, while it was only an increased action. The cordials and wine, upon the prin- ciple on which they have been given, are rationally administered; but there are strong reasons for not recommending them, arising from the general effect which all cordials have of increasing the action without giving real strength; and the powers of the body are afterwards sunk proportionally as they have been raised : by which nothing can be gained, but a great deal may be lost; for, in all cases, if the powers are allowed to sink below a certain point, they are irrecoverable. The local treatment has been as absurd as the constitutional. Scari- fications have been made quite to the living parts, that stimulating and antiseptic medicines might be applied to them, such as turpentines, the warmer balsams, and sometimes the essential oils. Warm fomentations have been also applied as congenial to life ; but warmth always increases action, and stimulants are improper where the actions are already too violent. Upon the principles here laid down, the bark is the only medicine that can be depended upon, as it increases the powers and lessens the action. Upon many occasions opium will be of singular service by lessening the action, although it does not give real strength. I have seen good effects from it, both when given internally in large doses, and when applied to the part. To keep the parts cool is proper; and all the applications should be cold. The above-mentioned practice is to be kept in view in mortifications that happen in the venereal disease.

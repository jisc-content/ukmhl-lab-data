427 OF THE LUES VENEREA. of mercury on a constitution will always be as the quantity of mercury in that constitution ; and when the same quantity affects one constitution more than another, it is in the proportion of the irritability of that con- stitution to the powers of mercury, entirely independent of any particu- lar preparation, or any particular mode of giving it. With regard to the preparations of the medicine, and the modes of applying it, we are to consider two things ; first, the preparation and mode that is attended with the least trouble or inconvenience to the patient; and second, the preparation and mode of administering it that most readily conveys the necessary quantity into the constitution. Nothing can show more the ungrateful or unsettled mind of man than his treatment of this medicine. If there is such a thing as a spe- cific, mercury is one for the venereal disease in two of its forms; yet mankind are in pursuit of other specifics for the disease, as if specifics were more common than diseases; while at the same time they are too often contented with the common mode of treating many other diseases for which they have no specific ; and these prejudices are supported by the public, who have in their minds a dread of this medicine, arising from the want of knowledge of our predecessors in administering it; and many of the present age, who are equally ignorant, take advantage of this weakness. Mercury in the constitution acts on all parts of the machine, cures those which are diseased, affecting but little those that are sound. Mer- cury is carried into the constitution in the same way as other substances, either externally by the skin, or internally by the mouth: it cannot, however, in all cases, be taken into the constitution in both ways, for sometimes it happens that the absorbents on the skin will not readily receive it, at least no effect will be produced, either on the disease or constitution, from such application; when this is the case it is to be considered as a misfortune, for then it must be given internally by the mouth, although possibly this mode may be very improper in other re- spects, and often inconvenient. On the other hand, it sometimes hap- pens that the internal absorbents will not take up this medicine, or at least no effect is produced either upon the disease or constitution; in such cases it is right to try all the different preparations of the medicine, for it will sometimes happen that one preparation will succeed when another will not. I have never seen a case where neither external nor internal applications of mercury were absorbed; such a case must be miserable indeed.â€™ I may just observe here, that many surfaces appear to absorb this medicine better than others, and most probably all internal surfaces and sores are of this kind; for when we find that thirty grains of calomel

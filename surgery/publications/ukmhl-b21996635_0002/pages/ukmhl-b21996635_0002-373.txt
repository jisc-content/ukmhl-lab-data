353 OF CHANCRE. Any of the caustics, such as the lapis septicus, as also the metallic salts, such as the lunar caustic, blue vitriol, &c., have this power. The rust of copper and savine-leaves mixed are one of the best stimulants. After they have been to appearance sufficiently destroyed, they often rise anew, not from any part being left, but from the surface of the cutis having the same disposition as before. This requires a repetition of the same practice, so as to take off that surface of the cutis. §.5. Of Excoriations of the Gians and Prepuce. It very often happens that the surface of the glans and inside of the prepuce excoriate, becoming extremely tender, and then a matter oozes out. The prepuce in such cases often becomes a little thickened, and sometimes contracts in its orifice, both which circumstances render the inversion of it difficult and painful. Whether this complaint ever arises from a venereal cause is not certain, as it often takes place where there never has been any venereal taint. This disease is in the cutis; and under such a disposition it has no power of forming a good cuticle. It is very similar to a gonorrhoea in this part, but is not venereal. Drawing the prepuce back, and steeping the parts in a solution of lead, often takes off the irritation, and a sound cuticle is formed. Spirits diluted often produce the same effect; the unguentum citrinum of the Edinburgh Dispensatory, lowered by mixing with it equal parts of hog’s- lard, is often of singular service in such cases. But there are cases which bid defiance to all our applications, in which I have succeeded by desiring the person to leave the glans uncovered, which produced the stimulus of necessity for the formation of a natural cuticle. 2 A VOL.

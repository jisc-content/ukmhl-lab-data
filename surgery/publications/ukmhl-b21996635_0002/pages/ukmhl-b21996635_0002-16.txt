If, therefore, it may with truth be said that he was the father of scientific surgery; if he may claim the high distinction of having placed the practice of surgery upon the only solid foundation, that of physiological science, it is no less true of this humble department than of those more important branches of the art, in which are involved the knowledge and treatment of diseases which stand in immediate connexion with vital organs and func- tions.

344 OF CHANCRE, CHAPTER IV. OF THE CURE OF CHANCRES IN WOMEN. The parts generally affected with chancres in this sex are more simple than in men, by which means the treatment in general is also more simple; hut in most cases they require nearly the same, both in the lo- cal application of mercury, and in throwing it into the constitution. It may be supposed, however, that it will be necessary in many cases to throw into the constitution more mercury than in men, because in general there are more chancres, and the surface of absorption of course larger. As it is difficult to keep dressings on the female parts, it is proper they should be washed often with solutions of mercury; perhaps cor- rosive sublimate is one of the best, as it will act as a specific, and also as a stimulant when that is wanted; but in chancres that are very ir- ritable, the same mode of treatment as was recommended in men is to be put in practice. Afterwards the parts may be besmeared with a mercurial application, either oily or watery, to be frequently repeated, according to the circumstances of the case. If the ulcers should have spread, or run up the vagina, great atten- tion should be paid to the healing of them ; for it sometimes happens that the granulations contract considerably, so as to draw the vagina into a small canal; at other times the granulations will unite into one another, and close the vagina up altogether; therefore in such cases it will be necessary to keep some substance in the vagina till the sores are skinned, for which purpose probably lint may be sufficient. CHAPTER V. OF SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHANCRES, AND THE TREATMENT OF THEM. After the chancres have been cured, and all venereal taint removed, it sometimes happens that the prepuce still retains a considerable degree

470 DISEASES RESEMBLING THE LUES VENEREA. are often mistaken, often calling it venereal when it is not; and some- times supposing it to be some other disease when it is venereal. Rheumatism, in many of its symptoms, in some constitutions, resem- bles the lues venerea; the nocturnal pains, swelling of the tendons, li- gaments, and periosteum, and pain in those swellings, are symptoms both of the rheumatism and the venereal disease when it attacks those parts : I do not know that I ever saw the lues venerea attack the joints, though many rheumatic complaints of those parts are cured by mercury, and therefore supposed to be venereal3. Mercury, given without caution, often produces the same symptoms as rheumatism; and I have seen even such supposed to be venereal, and the medicine continued. Other diseases shall not only resemble the venereal in appearance, but in the mode of contamination, proving themselves to be poisons by affecting the part of contact, and from thence producing immediate con- sequences similar to buboes; also remote consequences similar to the lues venerea. As errors in forming a judgment of a disease lead to errors in the cure, it becomes almost of as much consequence to avoid a mistake in the one as in the other; for it is nearly as dangerous in many constitutions to give mercury where the disease is not venereal as to omit it in those which are ; for we may observe, that many of the constitutions which put on some of the venereal symptoms, when the disease is not present, are those with which mercury seldom agrees, and commonly does harm. I have seen mercury, given in a supposed venereal ulcer of the tonsils, produce a mortification of those glands, and the patient has been nearly destroyed. When treating of the lues venerea, and giving the symptoms and ge- neral appearances of the disease, I related some cases which appeared to be venereal, though they really were not, and I shall now refer the reader to these, as it will be unnecessary to give them again here, al- a [The statement seems to be too general. Cases occasionally, though rarely, occur where inflammation of the synovial membrane of the joints shall take place in union with secondary symptoms of lues venerea of an undoubted character; shall increase in severity during the increase of the other symptoms; and shall subside as soon as mer- cury is efficiently used, and the eruption or sore throat are controlled by its exhibition. In such cases the synovial inflammation has an acute character; and is attended with a degree of pain and tension and superficial redness, which sufficiently distinguishes it from that languid form of the same affection which is common under circumstances of general cachexia, whether that cachexia has been produced by mercury acting as a poison, or by the long duration of the venereal disease itself, which has been allowed to continue till every function necessary for the maintenance of nutrition and of health has become deranged, and the patient has been reduced to a state which closely resembles scrofula.}

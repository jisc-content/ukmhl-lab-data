PREFACE. XV distinguishing himself in the field of original investi- gation and discovery, the sober reflective habits ot his mind, joined to a regular professional education, ena- bled him to obtain from an extensive practice such a knowledge of the diseases of these organs, and such well-grounded principles of their treatment, as to ren- der his work a very valuable acquisition, not to the professed dentist only, but particularly to the general practitioner; a class of the profession to which his labours were especially devoted, as he lectured on this subject for many years in the theatre of Guyâ€™s Hospital. It is, then, to the writers just mentioned that the pro- fession is principally indebted for the knowledge it at present possesses of the anatomy, physiology, and dis- eases of the teeth. It would be useless here to notice the numerous books which have from time to time ap- peared, chiefly derived, as they are, from these sources, the merits of which may generally be stated to be in the inverse ratio of their originality. Equally unnecessary is it to enter into an elaborate consideration of the hy- potheses which are entertained on the nature of these organs by some of the most distinguished French phy- siologists.

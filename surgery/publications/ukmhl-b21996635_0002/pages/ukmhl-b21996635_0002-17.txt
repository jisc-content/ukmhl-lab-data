His observa- tions and experiments had shown him that these organs differ in many important respects from the other bones; that the phenomena which these two organs present under comparative circumstances, whether of disease or of experiment, differ in many important respects; that the teeth are not susceptible of artificial injection; that they cannot restore lost parts; and many other peculiarities, which led him too hastily to infer that “ they are to be considered as extraneous bodies with respect to a circulation through their substance,” though the same candour obliges him to confess, in the same sentence, that “ they have most certainly a living principle, by means of which they make part of the body, and are capable of uniting with any part of a living body,” although the experiments on which he founds the latter proposition, if they prove anything, prove that this union with a living body is effected by means of a vascular continuity. Here, then, is an ex- ample of a love of truth for her own sake, so pure, so invulnerable, that not even to avoid the dilemma into which his imperfect reasoning upon these two ineon- i

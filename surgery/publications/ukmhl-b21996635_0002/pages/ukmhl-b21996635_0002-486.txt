PART VII. CHAPTER I. OF DISEASES RESEMBLING THE LUES VENEREA, WHICH HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR IT. There is probably no one disease to which some other may not bear a strong resemblance in some of its appearances or symptoms, whereby they may be mistaken for each other. The situation of a complaint also may mislead the judgment. A lump, for instance, in the breast of a woman, may resemble a cancer so much as to be mistaken for one, if all the distinguishing marks of cancer are not well attended to. An ulcer on the glans penis, or in the throat and nose, creates a suspicion of the venereal disease. Even the way in which a disease is caught becomes a cause of suspicion. The fluor albus in women sometimes produces a simple gonorrhoea in men. Drinking out of the same cup with a venereal patient was formerly supposed to be capable of commu- nicating the lues venerea, but this notion is I believe now exploded. Of late years a new mode of producing the venereal disease is supposed to have arisen; this is by the transplanting of a tooth from the mouth of one person into the mouth of another. That such practice has pro- duced diseases is undoubted, but how far it has been venereal remains to be considered. Diseases which resemble others seldom do it in more than one or two of the symptoms; therefore, whenever the nature of the disease is sus- pected, the whole of the symptoms should be well investigated, to see whether it agrees in all of them with the disease it is suspected to be, or only in part. This observation seems to be more applicable to the venereal disease than any other, for there is hardly any disorder that has more diseases resembling it in all its different forms than the vene- real disease; and when a disease resembles the venereal in some of its symptoms, but not at all in others, then those other symptoms are to be set down as the specific or leading ones of the disease to which it be- longs, the resembling symptoms to the venereal being only the common

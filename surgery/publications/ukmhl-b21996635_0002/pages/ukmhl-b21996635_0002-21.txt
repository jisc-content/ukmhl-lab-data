Before we enter into a description of the teeth themselves, it will he necessary to give an account of the upper and lower jaw-bones, in which they are inserted; insisting minutely on those parts which are connected with the teeth, or serve for their motion and action, and pass- ing over the others slightly. The upper jaw is composed of two bones, which generally remain distinct through life. They are very irregular at their posterior and upper parts, sending upwards and backwards a great many processes, that are connected with the bones of the face and skull*. The lower and anterior parts of the upper jaw are more uniform, making a kind of circular sweep from side to side, the convexity of which is turned for- wards ; the lower part terminates in a thick edge, full of sockets for the teeth. This edge is called in each bone the alveolar process f. Behind the alveolar processes there are two horizontal lamellae, which uniting together, form part of the roof of the mouth, which is the par- tition between the mouth and the nosef. This plate, or partition, is situated about half an inch higher than the lower edge of the alveolar process ; and this gives the roof of the mouth a considerable hollowness. The use of the upper jaw is to form part of the parietes of the mouth, nose, and orbits ; to give a basis, or supply the alveolar process, for the VOL. II. B

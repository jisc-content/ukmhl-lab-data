OF TIIK LUES VENEREA. 397 lieved to have been affected with the venereal disease, both from the circumstances preceding the complaint, and from the complaint itself being cured by mercury; and their being affected, when the other vis- cera are not, may arise from their being in some degree an external sur- face, as will be explained hereafter. It is this form of the disease therefore that gives us the comparative susceptibility of parts both for disposition and action. For we must suppose that all parts are equally and at once exposed to the action of the poison; but though there may be various degrees of susceptibility, it will be sufficient for practice to divide them into two, under the fol- lowing appellations of first in order, and second in order, to which we may add the intermediate. Whether the parts that are really first affected are naturally more easily affected by this kind of irritation, or that some other circumstance which belongs to these parts is the cause, cannot be absolutely deter- mined ; but, the matter being attentively considered, it would appear to be owing to something foreign to the constitution, and also not de- pending on the nature of the parts themselves; for if we take a view of all the parts that are first affected by this disease, when arising from the constitution, which I shall suppose are the parts most susceptible of it, we shall see that in the recent state of the disease these parts are sub- ject to one general affection, while there are similar parts of the body not affected by this disease, and not subject to this general affection. Probably the parts second in order may naturally be as susceptible of the irritation as those first in order; but not being under the influence of an irritating cause, they are later in coming into action; and there are also probably other causes in the nature of the parts themselves, such as being indolent in all their actions, and of course indolent in this, therefore later in coming into action. However, it is not universally the case that the parts which I have called first in order are always so ; on the contrary, we find that this order is inverted in some cases, al- though but rarely. We cannot suppose that this difference arises from any active power in the poison, nor any particular direction of it, but from properties in the parts themselves; for it may be allowed us to suppose that when this matter has got into the circulation it acts on all parts of the body with equal force; that is, it is not determined to any one part more than another by any general or particular power in the animal machine ; nor is the nature of the poison such as will fall more readily on one part of the body than another, when they are all in simi- lar circumstances. That some parts therefore are more readily affected by it than others, owing to circumstances which are no part of the animal principle nor of the poison; and also that some parts of the

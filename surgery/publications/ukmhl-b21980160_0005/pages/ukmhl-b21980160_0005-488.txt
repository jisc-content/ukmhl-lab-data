Of the Hydrocele, Chap. VI, 442 rounding teguments, any quantity of it may be eafily taken away with the fcalpel without the leaft hazard of wounding the fcrotum. Some writers indeed advife part of the fcrotum itfelf to be cut away on every occafion ; but even in the moft en- larged cafe of hydrocele I ever met with, no neceflity ever appeared for removing any part of it. On examining the tefticle after the di- vifion of the vaginal coat, it is generally found to be of a foft texture, and of a more pale complexion than in a healthy Hate: On fome occafions it is confider- ably enlarged ; and on others, 1 have feen it reduced to a very frnall fize, confiding of the tunica albuginea almoft quite emp- ty. As the cure of the fore however ad- vances, the tefticle in a gradual manner commonly regains its ufual bulk ; of this 1 have feen different inftances, and a very remarkable cafe of the fame kind is re- corded by Douglas f. â€˜ We * Vide Douglas on the Hydrocele, p. 136.

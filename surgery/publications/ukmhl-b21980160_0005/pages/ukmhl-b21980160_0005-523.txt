Sfed.VL Of the Hydrocele, 477 that part where the upper extremity of the tunica vaginalis terminates. We have already mentioned the means of diftin(5Hon between this fpecies of hy- drocele and that of the vaginal coat of the tellis. The only other afFec51ions with which it is in danger of being confounded, ai e the anafarcous hydrocele of thefpermatic cord; and a real hernia, either of the omentum, or of a portion of gut. From the former, however, as alfo from an omental hernia, it may in general be diftinguiflied by the feel. In neither of thefe can the fludtua- tion of a fluid be in the leaf! perceived, and to the touch they are both foft and inela- ftic; whereas, in this fpecies of hydrocele, the tumor has a fpringy kind of feel, and a flu61uatlon is evidently found in it. And in both the others, the fwelling recedes more or lefs upon prefTure, which it never does in this fpecies of eneyfted hydrocele. From a gut rupture it is chiefly diflln- guiflied by the tumor beginning, not at the ring in the external oblique mufcle, as is the cafe in hernia, but farther down the cord:

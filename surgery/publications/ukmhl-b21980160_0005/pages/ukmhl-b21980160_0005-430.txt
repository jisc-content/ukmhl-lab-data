Vf, ftudents in general are fo ignorant as of this; and hence their notions of thefe dif- eafes, and of the anatomy of the parts in which they are feated, are commonly very indiftin^l,â€”Nothing but a ftridl attention to the difcoveries of late anatomifts can convey clear and diftindl ideas concern- ing them ; and whoever will make him- felf thoroughly acquainted with thefe, will find, that the hydrocele, and other difor- ders to which thefe parts are liable, are ex- plained with as much clearnefs and fim- plicity as any other difeafe incident to the human body.

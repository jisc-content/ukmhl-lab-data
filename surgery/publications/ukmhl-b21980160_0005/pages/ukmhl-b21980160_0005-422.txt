Of Hernuff, Qiap. V. 380 back with her loins fomewliat elevated, and preffing with the fingers from the va- gina, defcents in future may in general be effedlually prevented by the ufe of the peflary reprefented in Plate IX. fig. i. And the fame means, we may remark, are em- ployed with fuccefs in preventing a fall- ing down of part of the inteftinal canal into the vagina; a fpecies of rupture which now and then occurs. It may happen, however, that the pro- lapfed parts, by being attacked with in- flammation and pain in confequence of ftridlure, may render the divifion of the parts producing thefe fymptoms as ne- ceffary in this as in any other cafe of her- nia ; in which event, the diredlions given in the preceding fedlions for the treatment of inteftinal hernias, will be equally appli- cable here.â€”Only it muft be remembered, that as in the hernia cyftica without any complication, the protruded parts are not covered with a fac; fo a ftill greater de- gree of caution is neceflary in laying them bare.

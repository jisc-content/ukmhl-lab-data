THY110ID RUPTURE. 88 rupture is between the m. pectineus and adductor brevis, or between the front heads of the adductor. The obturator vessels are upon its inner hinder part, and large branches of the obturator nerve are before it. Differences however may occur, especially if the obturator and epigas i ic arteries arise in common, of which a case was seen by Gadeumann where the artery passed first on the inner, and then on the front of the hernial sac. This rupture is at first very apparent, if a large quantity of intestine be protruded. It may have a different form, because it penetrates through different interspaces of the muscles. It occurs more commonly in females than in males, and may contain intestines omentum, and even the urinary bladder; and not rarely does it occur at the same time on both sides. rCLOQUET says (a), that “ Ruptures of the suhpuhic (thyroid) hole are much more any great bulk.

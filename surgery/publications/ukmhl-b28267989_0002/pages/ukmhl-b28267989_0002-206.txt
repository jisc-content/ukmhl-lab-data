The symptoms which characterize aneurysm are the following: A little elastic pulsating swelling, which diminishes on pressure, an boom returns on its withdrawal, arises at some one spot corresponding el course of the artery. The pulsation ceases when the artery is compressed between the swelling and the heart, and the former becomes generally less tense. If the artery be compressed below the swelling, the pulsa .on becomes^ ore bounding and district.

In proportion as the swelling increases the blood contained m d becomes more solid by coagulating, and can be no longer g ,y pressure; the pulsation is weaker, and often entirely lost (1) JNJ tumour has acquired considerable size, it acts mjunou^y by g 1ggi and expansion upon the neighbouring parts ; the artery in the other blood and lymphatic vessels, is interfered with, tW nerves’ are compressed; the nourishment warmth and scn^tion oHh, part are diminished ; the limb becomes oedematous y swelledthe tug is covered with varicose vessels, and becomes bluish; and the surrounding; muscles and bones even, may be destroyed by the constant P=e - absorption.

The Echinococcus hominis (Hulscnwurm, Germ.) attains the si? of a walnut, and even that of the fist, occurs for the most part only i the organs of reproductive life, and presents in its interior, nuroerow little worms as big as grains of sand or of millet seed, on each of whici if examined with the naked eye, may be perceived a single circle of hook and suckers. . 2267. The Acephalocysts exist as large or small vesicles, from the siz of a lentil to that of a child’s head, and of various number and colorn Where developed, they are always surrounded with a more or less toug membrane, in which are found bladders of different number. This raem brane is generally very firm, sometimes at certain parts fibrocartilagmoui cartilaginous, or even bony, and its thickness proportionate to its size, an the time it has existed ; it is often closely connected with the surroundin parts, especially in parenchymatous organs, sometimes only loosely s< when in the midst of an organ having much cellular tissue, or when l the neighbourhood of a cavity. The inner surface of this membrane i lined with another membrane, frequently smooth, sometimes uneven, w 9 exhales a transparent, limpid, yellowish, purulent, thick, turbid fluid, j which the hydatids swim singly or in great number, even as many as up t 700 or 800. The membrane of the hydatid itself is elastic, extensible, if tracts after its contents are emptied, is sometimes so delicate that it MM with the least touch, and sometimes thick and capable of being separate into four or five layers. It is never attached to its covering. 1 he Hun in it is commonly as limpid as pure water, except that it contains a «ata quantity of albumen; it has for the most part the same app^ranc that of the covering in which it is contained ; it has, however, been ioun transparent,, whilst that of the membrane was purulent 2268. Acephalocysts are developed in all organs, in the 1 , ^ brain, kidneys, lungs, muscles, bones, and the like, and the da"<=■ ar disease depends on the importance of the organ.

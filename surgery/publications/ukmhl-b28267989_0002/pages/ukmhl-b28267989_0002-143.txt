Nothing seemed so likely to effect these purposes, as the removal of the pendulous flap and other protuberances, which surrounded the anus. I hoped the inflammation caused by this operation would produce a more firm adhesion of the rectum to the surrounding cellular substance; and I could not doubt that the circular wound would bring on a : greater stricture in the sphincter ani.” (pp. 443, 44.) It is not out of place to remark in reference to these operations, that Velpeau observesVery frequently a portion of the fleshy coat of the intestine is found accompanying the mucous coat in prolapsed rectum. There is no inconvenience in removing with the mucous membrane a portion of the muscular tissue; on the contrary, the cure will be more complete, and I have some disposition to believe that the want of success which has occasionally followed the operation has depended on the omission of this precaution.” (p. 135.) The only means of “ restoring the disturbed union between the inner membrane of the intestine and its external surface,” is, according to Copeland, “ by exciting a degree of inflammation on the external surface of the inner membrane, sufficient to pro- duce an union and consolidation of the parts together.” He objects to the use of stimu- ilating injections, as inflaming the mucous surface, causing great pain and distress, without any material benefit to the disease; for the inflammation is propagated along the mucous surface, without extending to the deeper seated parts or external coat of the intestine. Having shown that the inner coat of the alimentary canal loses a consider- able portion of its villous nature as it approaches its extremities, that wounds at such points are less serious than when inflicted on the more interior portions of the canal, and that • the degree of pam is beyond all comparison, less in proportion as the part wounded or tied is more removed from the anus and the cutis surrounding it; an operation or ligature which would be violently painful at the circumference of the anus nJL;nV°1Ve the smallest portion of the skin, being spoken of as little more than r * or not ca lln8 &rth any expression of pain, when performed on a part of feve^d7nflnTret-emLVe^ fr01?the Seat°f external sensation; and the consequent , tha “ ilTtl1 having the same relation to the part,” he proceeds to observe.

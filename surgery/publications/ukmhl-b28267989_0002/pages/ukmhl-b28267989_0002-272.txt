The skin and\ fascia fate being . divided, and the edge of the m. sartorius drawn somewhat outwards, the artery is found enclosed in its cellular sheath, with the femoral vein under it, and the branches of the crural nerve on its outei side.

If an aneurysm be in the ham or on the upper part of the ar enes of the le°- there may be sufficient space for tying the artery in the ham, bu tonaccoun of the depth of the vessel, of the difficulty of its isolation, kfnearness to the joint, and so on, this operation is to be considered as by far more dangerous and less safe than that of tying the femoral arteiv. In i aneummsTyino- the femoral artery is to be unconditionally preferred and only in cases of wound of the popliteal artery is its tymg ^dicat^im which sufficient enlargement of the wound is the rest, the popliteal artery has been tied in three different parts, middle, upper, and lower part of the ham. 1484 If the artery is to be laid bare m the middle of the ham, the line of the ham, through the skin and aponeuiosis, takina thevena saphena ; .hedges of the wound being then geon penetrates deeper with careful cuts, and with the haili t » through the cellular tissue, often side' L ££ as tul trz arteries.

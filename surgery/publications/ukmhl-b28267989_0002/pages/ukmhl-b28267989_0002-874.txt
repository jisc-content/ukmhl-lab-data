La Charite, of bleeding from a single leech bite on the belly in related by Brichetau (a); that of an old woman in La days retiree- to whose belly leeches had been applied; she went on well for three days, retiree to rest at night apparently well, hut on the following morning was fouiid dead in heii bed in a pool of blood. My friend Green, some years since, had a man in St. Thomas s. who died of bleeding from the temporal artery, whichi had.beeri bitten by a^ee°h- ^ | the latter kind, the case of a child of nine months, who died in a mgh. after a bite is recorded (c). No such fatal cases have come under my own care, but 1 I frequen ly seen the bleeding continued for several days, so as to render the patient pa as ashes an dWeakened as under severe loss of blood under any circumstances. Th cause dof the “dings is either from an artery being wounded by the bite as nj Green’s case certainly, and probably also in Bmchetau s and in i .

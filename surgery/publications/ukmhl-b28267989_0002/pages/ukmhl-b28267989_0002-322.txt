I he examw nation is more necessary, as in many cases, the inability of children to suck* from their mother and wet-nurse is ascribed to the tying of the tonguw whilst it really depends on other causes. . 1578 When by this unnatural attachment of the tongue, sucking u prevented, or at a later period the speech is interfered with, the tongue must be set loose that it may enjoy free motion. _ 1579 In cases where the above-mentioned tumour is observed undo J It/ i »/• 3 Ll^L in PnttinC ■ the tongue, speedy assistance is always needed, which consists in cutting j into the swelling. An assistant holds the chdd s^nose, forcibly ^ °lj th^tongue with°the thumb and forefinger of the left hand with * pH upwards by which the fleshy mass is made more tense, and then it is cm i bRo with a pair of blunt-pointed scissors.

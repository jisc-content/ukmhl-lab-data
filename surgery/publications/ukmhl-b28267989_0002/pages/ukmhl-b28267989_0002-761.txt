BY CUTTING. 753 In large, long-continued and far-extending polyps, it is possible that the fundus of the womb may be dragged down, the ligature must therefore not be tied too high ud : I have related a fatal case of this kind (a). b 1 2385. Cutting off polyps of the womb, the oldest method, is, on account j of the danger following, and the difficulty of stanching the blood, only to ■ be employed in particular cases, for instance : first, when the polyp, after » having been tied fast during several days, has not dropped off, in which case, generally, considerable pain follows every tightening of the liga- : ture; second, when the polyp hangs down, or can easily be drawn out if I its neck can be got at, is thin, and there have been no previous bleeding • f .p when the polyp has produced eversion of the womb, accompanied with dangerous symptoms, which can only be got rid of by the quick removal of the polyp. Siebold (b), however, not only in this, but in all I other cases, prefers cutting off to tying a polyp of the womb, when it has a neck and can be reached, whether it be at the fundus, in the body, or r at the neck of that organ. If in consequence of the breadth of the base ■by which it is attached to the fundus or body of the womb, cutting faff the polyp be not possible, he ties it, for the purpose of contracting ■ the stem, and then cuts it off below the ligature. This mode of pro- in-eeding is less painful, more speedy, unattended with any particular symptoms without fear of bleeding, and even should that happen iJ lnaSuiysSlChe<l 7 ?Ug^lg 5 th® patient is not inconvenienced by a h le i f andi dlSChar£e’ may leave her bed in a few days, and has In reWonfi “ PUrCYTREN’s rePeated operations in this way |-ntir^y confirm Siebold s statements (Pigne') ; and although practice ,ihaV-ie iesult a,fter c/ttirig off the polyp maybe fatai <»>so on the deeding",;) Sh°'VS th&t after tying’ there may be severe> and even fatal ii-mnnS1^1Thf a°f the i"0"1!5 iS t0 bGPerformed in the follow- pemtion fn'rTk 1 pa1tient bein° placed in the same position as for the Pmh°n,f the stone) an assistant presses on the belly to force down the I het; J St an0thr keeps the labia asunder- The polyp being found in ■ f thaf n ’ a speculum Wlth movable branches is introduced, and the walls | I ^passage are expanded with it, so as to isolate the polyp which t i, he poTvteCi ,Wlt 1 Meseux,s forceps and the speculum withdrawn.

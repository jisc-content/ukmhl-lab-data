The following are generally the symptoms of a reducible rupture o/ tlie belly, a swelling of quick or gradual production, not painful, elastic, of different form according to the opening by which it protrudes, on the surface of which the skin is unchanged, which can be returned by sufficient pressure, which returns of itself when the patient lies on his back, but after any exertion in coughing, sneezing, and the like, also after meal-time again protrudes or enlarges. It is accompanied with symptoms of disturbed intestinal functions, as sluggish bowels, rumblings in the bowels, belchings, disposition to vomit, dragging pains in the belly, and the like, which symptoms subside if the swelling be reduced, and afterwards the bowels are usually relieved. If the rupture be small and deeply situated, the diagnosis is often difficult, and must be determined by close examination, by consideration of the origin of the swelling, and by all the existing symptoms. 1122. Decision as to the parts contained in the rupture is often very difficult, often even impossible, on account of the different changes which the parts themselves and the coverings of the rupture undergo. * • [Cuelius’s observation, in reference to the difficulty or impossibility of distinguishing intestinal from omental rupture, is most fully borne out by practical experience, so that few persons are so hardy as to prognosticate the contents of a rupture-sac till it is opened.—J. F. S.] 1123. The intestinal rupture is characterized by a swelling more regular • on its surface, elastic, which enlarges when the intestine is loaded, and in returning affords a gurgling noise (1), often felt in the swelling by the patient himself, and by the simultaneous symptoms of stoppage of the passage of the stools. [(1) This gurgling noise is often entirely independent, I believe, of intestine, and caused by the quantity of fluid contained in the sac. And from the same cause arises a symptom which often puzzles a young Surgeon; to wit, the seeming reduction of a large portion 289 inguinal.

302 TREATMENT 1547. If the piles produce by their size or hardening constant incon- venience bloodv, mucous, or purulent discharges exhausting the patient’s powers, continual pain, and the like, if they be external to the rectum, , or project at every time of going to stool, and prevent the discharge oi ,j: the motions, their removal is indicated. It is, however, to be remein-» bered that after the destruction of the piles by the reflection of mflagprff: mation upon the other veins, their tone is raised, and thus in part tl« (t. cause of the luemorrhoids is removed. Where, however, they are a • healthy habitual emptying, or when they have causal relations with ej incurable diseases, as, for example, phthisis pulmnnahs, we must be can-• tious with their removal; it must either be not undertaken at all, or, a' ; least, all the piles must not be removed at once. . 1« 1548 Extirpation of the haemorrhoids has been proposed in tbreml different ways. First. A ligature to be applied around the base of the*' whole swelling, and this gradually, and not at once, tightened, till thrtP knots have fallen off (1). Second. The external skin of the pile is t<; be divided with a cut down to its base, and separated on both sides fron^ the under-lying skin, which is to be cut off with scissors. I he advantage, of this practice is, that the remaining external skin covers the seat of tta# vein, and prevents the bleeding. Third. The pile is to be grasped w.tl A the forceps, drawn forwards and cut off with scissors in such wayttadjj some still remains on the base, by which the wound is partially covered In external hemorrhoids, the cut is to be made in the parts below tk svhincter. The entire surface of the wound retracts into the rectum, amG by the action of the sphincter is contracted, whence the j bleedina- is very much diminished. If the wound be retracted above th e sphincter, internal bleeding may take place. This practice is ea>J> . J preferable to the others, as after the ligature there is often severe _pam] Inflammation, vomiting,’retention of urine, and so on; an the ,«i , the external, and the ^traction of the internal skin, .s always d (fled, ,1 and in many cases, on account of their union, impossible. Ihe la^« hHemorrhoids, also, are mostly formed by effusion of blood beneath thjj internal coat of the rectum m Rousseau J. C.

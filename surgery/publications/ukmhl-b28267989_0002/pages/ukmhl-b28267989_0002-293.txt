TELEANGIECTASY. 285 t laster. Third, the practice recommended by Marshal Hall (a), of t iercing with a fine needle through the whole mass of the teleangiectasy, Sose to the sound part, and its repetition in from eight to ten different rections. The punctured canals heal and the tissue is thereby changed. «here possible, pressure may still be employed, but it has no particular ect. Fourth, according to Lallemand (b), cutting into or cutting I it a piece of the teleangiectasy, and uniting the edges of the wound ith the twisted suture, or the introduction of long and thick needles irough the swelling, which are not however used for twisting round ie thread, but their points only bent up, and the part defended with a roper covering. When the needles have suppurated out, if the swelling ill continue, they must be introduced again. We need not be uneasy at le bluish, almost blackish, appearance of the swelling immediately after te introduction of the needles; it is a good sign that the inflammation will tain sufficient height. A frequent repetition of the lunar caustic is ne- :ssary ; perhaps the application of nitrate of silver is better. Fifth, the troduction of a seton by means of a needle, through the teleangiectasy, f which the bleeding from the needle-stab is stanched, and by it imaining in a proper degree of inflammation and suppuration is pro- iced (c). If the latter do not occur, some irritating injection should 3 thrown into the puncture, as Lloyd (d) has recommended, without ie previous introduction of a seton. The advantage of this, as well so as of IIall s piactice is that the skin upon the swelling is preserved _ld a smaller scar made.

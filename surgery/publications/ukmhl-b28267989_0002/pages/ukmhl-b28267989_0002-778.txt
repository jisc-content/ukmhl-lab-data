TREATMENT OF SCIRRHUS BY COMPRESSION. 770 Compression of scirrhus, increased gradually to a very great degree, as recon > mended by Samuel Young (a), has been, on repeated experiment, not found • y ‘ O nnSMrnr nrwl mnrp KeriOUS nrOGTIT menaea oy samuel iounu yuj, um —r - . v I correspond with our expectations, but even causes a quicker aud more serious progre I of the disease (b). Recamier’s more recent experiments, however, speak more fa'ou I ably for this practice. It appears from his numerous observations, that in incipiei i scirrhous swellings, compression can restore the tissue of t e lse P . iJ natural condition without depriving it of its nourishment; in further ad^l ced swe lm the tissue diminishes, and passes into a cartilaginous condition " ^ I 1 has lost its proper structure, and is converted into a cartilaginous or lard-likesu^» , it may be lessened by compression, without restoring its orgamz 1 > • - . , atrophic. The adhesions of the swelling with the surrounding t^ue s not on not increased, but lessened, and even the thin adherent skin ma£ " natural state. By this diminution of the adhesions, an actual <cleaJt L Iftbcted wh after previous division of the skin with escharotics or the knife, may eflcctcd it. the fingers.

Compression may be employed m the most careft and gentle manner, and most effectually by linen or flannel bandages with soft man tinder beneath it, and accompanied at the same tome, 1heXk stances of the case, with the internal and external use of suitable emedies, hemlocfa mercury, iodine, depletives, repeated application of leeches, and the likeAc> rif pressure be at all employed in the attempt to cure scirrhous tumours, the bes mode Tf itTapScation is pfLly by means of the circular - euffnon invited b Dr. N.

The removal of the diseased part with the knife, or jt» desfcrucbw with escharotics, are the only remedies which can be employed with the 1^ certainty ; a return of the disease is, however under the most; fa oura circumstances, to be dreaded. Both before and after the operation it mustbe endeavoured by treatment to improve the constitution by the pr 1 * ^ of iodine and the like, by purging, and suitable regulation of living, to ensure, as far as possible, a favourable rtsult. ** of proceeding (the knife and escharotics) are, on ie o i * ^ jt indicated when the cancer has already made 50 n Ctftuuted that must be considered a constitutional affection, ant ‘ " t ^ be all the degenerated part cannot be removed.

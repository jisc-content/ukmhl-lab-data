Second. Tlie loop is applied with the assistance of a loop-drawer around the polyp, and its tying managed with a single tube, or with a loop-tier. Here belong the apparatus of Herbiniaux (j), Stark (k), Desault (/), with Bichat’s modification (m), John Hunter (w), and Ricou (o). Third. The loop applied around the root of the polyp, with a loop- drawer, and tied together by the use of little rings, through which the two ends of the ligature are passed. Such are the rosecrown instrument of Boucher (jo), Loeffler’s alteration (q), Sauter’s (r) combination of it with Ribke’s instrument (s). 2379. Of these several instruments for tying polyps of the womb those only will be here mentioned, as being most suitable, which were employed by Desault, and the tier of Nissen and Ribke. Previous to the opera- tion the rectum must be emptied with a clyster. The patient is to be placed on a bed or table, so as to be in a half lying, half sitting posture, and the perinceum and region of the coccyx exposed. The thighs must be separated by an assistant, and a careful examination made to ascertain the nature and seat of the polyp. 2380. Desault’s apparatus is to be employed as above mentioned {par. 2337.) A pretty strong ligature must be passed through the eye of j a loop-drawer, and to a silver tube somewhat curved forwards, and the end jjj1 ot the ligature fastened on one ring of the silver tube. This and the ! loop-tier are now carried parallel to each other between the swelling and the wall of the womb on that side where there is least resistance, and by l>slightly moving it laterally, carried to the upper part of the stem of the to polyp. That end of the ligature attached to the ring of the tube beino- n loosened, the loop-drawer is held fixed with the left hand, whilst with the . r'ght the tube is carried round the whole swelling and back to the loop- b rawer. The hands are now to be used instead of the instruments, and so » -rossed over each other that the part of the loop which the tube draws with t ^ass over that held by the loop-drawer. The tube is now drawn nf!.\rhilst tke drawer is kePt stea<Jy> the two ends of the thread passed tie opening of a loop-tier, and this pushed up to the root of the go yp, whilst the ends of the thread are held fast, the stem of the loop- rawer then presse(] forward8j the ]igature rem0ved from its aperture, " ™ the drawer removed. The two ends of the ligature are now drawn f ffic,ent]y tight, and fastened to the notch of the loop-tier t • U?. flgD4 a Sj01‘'rur8'9Cl|1’ Bemerkungen, vol. i. ment. chirurg. in qua novum humeri ex articulo exstirpandi methodum, novumque ad ligaturam Polyporum instrumentum proponit.

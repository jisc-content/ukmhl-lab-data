The other fatty tumours which arise between the two plates of - he cellular expansion beneath the skin, from an increased and altered I egetation of the mucous bags of the first and second order, are situated leeper, are covered with the panniculus adiposus, have a defined boundary, greater mobility, more elastic hardness, and are enveloped in a proper ellular cyst, which is commonly so firmly connected with the fat that jo hey can scarcely be distinguished. In general this cyst is very thin, often ijtill thinner as the swelling becomes larger; only in rare cases is it firm, ■Sendinous, and in part cartilaginous. This tumour consists of spherical ■ .lasses of fat, which differ from the natural fat, nearly resembling a sliee i nrougli the brain, or through a lymphatic gland, without cavities and . lartitions ; sometimes they appear as if composed of circularly twisted or y lid lately disposed plates (a). ibhpa Khe °.pm,°in °f th'S t.'vofoId form of Upoma, which may be sufficiently distin- , - uloml f.xa“lnat10?’ nl,croscopic observations also agree.

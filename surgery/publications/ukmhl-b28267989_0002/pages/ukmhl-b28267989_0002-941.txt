AT THE HIP. 933 Many die so long after, and in such way, that death cannot be directly ascribed to the operation. Jaeger (a), who has performed this operation successfully, has collected all the cases known to him, of which the following, which were successful, must be mentioned to wit, those of Baudens (6), Mayo (c), Sedillot (d), and Textor (e). . K,ri’ier (/)> "'ho lost a patient from sudden spasm, ten days after operating, accord- ing to Larrey’s method, considers this operation inadmissible on account of its danger. 1 he results up to the present time do not confirm this objection. There is also little advantage in Krimer’s proposal of, instead of the exarticulation, tying the common iliac artery so as to cause death of the diseased extremity ! ? If the Surgeon hesitate to perform the operation through the joint, he could have no objection to perform it high up through the great trochanter, by which opening the joint would be avoided.— J. F. S.J t o 2/41. So great extension of mortification as effects the thigh throimh- out its whole thickness, and such crushing of the thigh-bone, and of the soft parts as render flap-amputation below the great trochanter impossible can alone be considered as indications for amputation at the hip-joint! Coney, in the hip-joint can never indicate this operation because the socket is always affected.

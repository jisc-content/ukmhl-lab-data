677 OSTEOSTEATOMA AND OSTEOSARCOMA. In most cases the removal of exostosis is best effected by Hey’s, Macheli.’s (a), ij' or Graefe’s (6) saw, and Heine’s bone-knife. I When the position of the exostosis will not permit its removal in the above manner, instead of proceeding to amputation, its absorption should be encouraged by removing the periosteum from the swelling, in consequence of which its vessels are pulled ouc. This plan of treatment is at least recommended by Asteey Cooper (c). On the side of the nail, especially of the great toe, tumours not unfrequently arise i which are hard and immovable, covered with a glossy skin, their interior as hard as the bone from which they arise, and they are mostly seated on a broad base. They cause considerable inconvenience in walking ; after extirpation they soon recur, and the only remedy is the removal of the whole phalanx. 2213. Osteosteatoma and Osteosarcoma (Knoclienspeck und Knochen- jieisch-Geschivulst, Germ.) and Spina ventosa ( Winddorn, Germ.) I must be considered as allied diseased conditions, inasmuch as in both there is an enlargement of the bone deviating from its natural condition, with which its nature is completely changed and converted into a fun- gous, fleshy, jelly- cartilage- fibre- medulla- fat- or lard-like substance, in i which are found larger or smaller pieces of bone of various shape. 2214. -The causes of osteosteatoma and osteosarcoma are partly ex- t ternal, partly internal; to the former belong violence of all kinds; to the latter, an ill condition of the juices, venereal, scrofulous, rheumatic, l and gouty diseases. Boyer and others suppose that osteosarcoma is of I similar nature to carcinomatous degeneration of soft parts, and support s a 1 1 | pi | 1819. ' * T (c) Above cited.

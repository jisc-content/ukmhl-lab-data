AMPUTATION THROUGH THE LEG. 915 and presenting itself to view, whether dead or living, proclaims the unavoidable misery of a sugarloaf stump. This distressing result depends upon the vital contractility of the muscular tissue, which continuing in operation so long as the cut surface is not prevented from yielding by the formation of new adhesions, not only lessens the mass ot flesh provided for covering the bone but gradually retracts it together with the ■ superjacent integuments.” He thinks that this effect is, among other circumstances, caused by amputating through the lower third of the thigh, and has, therefore, for man) years lecommended amputating through the middle of the thigh in preference, | o pi event the great risk or almost certainty of protrusion to which the bone is ex- posed when divided at or near its lower third.” He then compares the result of am- putation with the circular cut through the lower third of the thigh, “which being the innest pai t of the limb, most readily admits of forming a stump composed only of skin, and then directs that “the incision of the skin should be made as near the knee as possible, not in a circular direction but so as to form two semilunar edges, which may meet together in a line from side to side without projecting at the corners.

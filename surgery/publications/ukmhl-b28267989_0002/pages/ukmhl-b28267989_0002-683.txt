675 ITS CAUSES, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS. An interesting case of extirpation of the finger with its metacarpal bone, at the 4 carpus, is given by Walther (a). Muller (b) has also collected the various observa- nt tions on enchondrom, and it has also been written on by J. Herz (c). 2206. Exostoses may arise in all bones, but they most frequently appear on the compact parts of tubular bones, and on flat bones, in the middle of the thigh, of the shin-bone, the upper-arm-bone, the radius and ulna, and ; on the bones of the skull, but rarely in the neighbourhood of the spongy joint-ends of bones. The proximate cause of exostosis is a change of the nutritive process of the bone from inflammation, in consequence of which a large quantity of phosphate of lime is deposited in the bony tissue, and upon this its enlargement depends. The time required for its i development seems correspondent with that for the natural formation of I bone and callus, as its substratum is at first soft, and only at a later period hardens. The occasional causes which bring about this inflammation are, ■.■as already generally noticed, either external violence or internal disease, ►especially syphilis, gout, and scrofula. There may be so remarkable •predisposition to exostosis, or an increasing deposit of bony substance, that ivery inconsiderable external violence may favour its formation’ (d). Syphilis in general produces, especially as consequence of inflammatory ■affection of f lip 'tTiPT*! n.Q't'PI/'YVi cnnorflniol J / /~1 . ht t • Edit, of 2x2

SPLAY-FOOT. 186 1384. Splay-foot is either congenital, and shows itself in different degrees directly after birth, as I have several times noticed, in which tfierf is unyieldingness of the m. peronci, especially of the m. peronem longus, and the ailment is certainly caused by the position of the child in the womb; or it is developed later, rarely in the female sex and in c nldien under ten years. There is probably a congenital disposition in the position ofu the tarsal bones, or atony of the plantar fascia and tarsal ligaments, where first, at a subsequent period, and from straining in standing walking, and so on, splay-foot is developed, and the heel-bone is so twisted inwards that its outer surface inclines more upwards, and the innei mowj downwards at the same time. The position of the other tarsal bom*- and their joints is little changed ; the head of the astragalus and cubrndi bone often project rather more inwards. In many families, especially among Jews, splay-foot is hereditary. Continual standing, especially with bare feet upon the damp ground, and much work influence its d \elopi ment. In the higher classes splay-foot very rarely occurs. itself ^unken^^h^HgamraTs,^es^ciall^t^^dOTsal^li^inents, those^betwa- and navicular bone, but still more, the plantar ^ d°elto d mamem, and the two bones are very much stretched.

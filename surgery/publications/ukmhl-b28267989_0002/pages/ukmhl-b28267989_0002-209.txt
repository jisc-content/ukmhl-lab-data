201 OF ANEURYSM. I cannot assent to several of the conditions laid down by Chelius, as distinguishing true from false aneurysm. The diminution of the bulk of a true aneurysm depends materially in the stage at which it has arrived; if it be recent, and there be little or no lining of clot t does diminish readily on pressure of the artery between the sac and the heart; but the’ liminution under these circumstances is less and less, in proportion to the ’increased julk of the sac, so that, in a large aneurysm there is, comparatively, little diminu- ion of size, though the current of blood be stopped. False aneurysm diminishes still less, and often, indeed, when the blood continues, as it commonly does, pour- ng into the cellular tissue it there coagulates, scarcely any perceptible diminution of •ize is made by pressure on the artery between it and the heart. And a true aneurysm chicli has burst a sac beneath the skin, as sometimes happens, is similarly circumstanced. Die pulsation is generally less distinct in a false than in a true aneurysm; but this also lepends on the period and extent occupied by the blood which has escaped, and is pro- wrhonally less, the greater the quantity of blood poured out. The external form of false aneurysm is undoubtedly irregular, as it much depends upon the looseness of the urrounding cellular tissue, and whether the part be or be not enveloped in a tendinous heath; but the immediate sac, consisting only of more or less numerous layers of oagulated blood, which as they continue to form, thrust the loaded cellular tissue awav rom the artery and hollow it out for their own lodgment, is generally of a regular oval irm, and has at one or other part au aperture, by which blood continues escaping and orging the ceUu ar tissue surrounding the false sac, till at last it distends the skin so mch that it mortifies and gives way at one or more points, and bloody serum and clots ixed with ill-formed pus, which is commonly produced towards the termination of e disease, begin to be discharged, and increase in quantity till the false sac itself p16 bl°fd fadllymakes its way out- 1 cannot understand the observa- on that m the sac of a tnie aneurysm layers of coagulated blood are never deDo L:!c^ sease proceeds they are certainly formed, although Hodgson deniL it and savs S ) SlTto\hePd[ffeal dilatlT°£ the C°atS of fee aneurysm, although iS'.he’formei^tt 2™ Ye a^ffin funded having been either absorbed or stretched to bursting- bv it/ ' ^ sur' parse long as the surrounding- cellular tissue® f 6 aueul7smaJ sac>Jt continues indeed eT»Ut,d^i;ru^ ^Trtoy?mmla°L*fo^ corresponding to thatof0tlTe’oourse6 %“• ”> .the neighbourhood V a ^ actised touch is’e^lyd^tinmifol^n pulsaf‘011’ w.hich> however, to a h sinking of the swelling- hot ifia ?’ 3S p- cons’sts orAy in a raising d’hates by the impartedmotion^^ 7SWe ]m^. co,ntain fluid which rtainty, hLever, Lay beSed if “ ?°Ubtful: a degree of -velhng, and the Jter be C^erly \\ ifoVfo f'00d is^itl Wrrai^srnf Th^ai-1 h^1’f^ witnessL'cl a case in on " lnt° thC b°tt0m °f the neck’ a”d there fonS“afomSr.'whS 'J) K,BM’ PmVlS^ir'vof f.’ p.e.^th°l0gie’ 61 de Chirurgie,

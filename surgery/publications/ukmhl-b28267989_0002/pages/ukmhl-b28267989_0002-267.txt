259 ILIAC ARTERY. le upper half an inch from the os pubis, and the lower the same distance from the -terict profunda, but the artery was not divided between them. “ The tumour diminished really after the operation, and the blood contained in it became coagulated, which it d not appear to have been before the operation.” * * * Every thing went off well I 1 ^ ll A ll /1A IF n Al^ ^ A A A A AAAA AAA 1a A.A 4 A A A A A A AA A «AA ^ A d — .1 i.1. 1_ 1 1 1 1 appear _ _ _ ^ _ II the fifteenth day, when the upper ligature separated, and the“ blood gushed a full stream from the open extremity of the vessel. The bleeding was stopped r pressure. The stream of blood which flowed upon any remission or wrong plication of the pressure was so large that we did not dare to remove the patient en from the bed on which he lay. Mr. Easisden undertook, in this situation, prevent the further escape of blood from the vessel, whilst I proceeded to tie e artery above Poupart’s ligament. Accordingly, I first made an incisiofi, about ree inches in length, through the integuments of the abdomen, in the direction of the tery, and thus laid bare the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, which I next vided from its connexion with Poupart’s ligament, in the direction of the external pund, for the extent of about two inches. The margin of the internal oblique and trans- -salis muscles being thus exposed, I introduced my finger beneath them for the protec- l>n of the peritonanim, and then divided them. Next with my hand I pushed the perito- um and its contents upwards and inwards, and took hold of the external iliac artery th my finger and thumb, so that I was enabled to command the flow of blood from the bund. It now only remained that I should pass a ligature round the artery and tie it • t this required caution, on account of the contiguity of the vein to the artery. I could t see the vessels, but I made a separation between them with my fingers. Having wever, only a common needle with which to pass the ligature, I several times withdrew t point from apprehension of wounding the vein. After having tied the artery about inch and a half above Poupart’s ligament, I divided that part, and thus laid bare e new and the former wound into one. * * * No adhesion took place between the uded parts; the edges of the wound were open and sloughy. * * * Still no greater ischief appeared till the fifth day after the operation, when a haemorrhage of arterial !>od took place in such quantity that there was no doubt but that it arose from the (ncipal artery, though the ligature with which it was tied still remained firm.” No •ther attempt at tying the vessel higher up was made, but compresses were fixed with 'andage, and continued for three days, but there was still occasional, though not pro- e bleeding. “ In the course of the eighth day after the last operation he died.” On rntmination,it was found, that, “ for nearly two inches above the part which was tied the nisnphatic glands covering the artery were considerably enlarged. The external lace of one of them next the wound had ulcerated, and the ulceration penetrated ough the gland, and communicated with the artery. * * * The ulcerated opening • J? ‘h™uShA the dlseased g]and> admitted the passage of a moderate-sized ie.

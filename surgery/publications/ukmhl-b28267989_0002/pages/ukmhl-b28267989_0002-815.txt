At this time, the patient’s powers appeared so depressed, that it was determined “ no further attempt should be made to save the penis and testes.’’ Mr. Kef, therefore. “ passed a temporary ligature round each spermatic cord, and then divided them. A band was then passed round the penis in the same manner, which was then cut through about an inch and a half from its root. The tumour was now dissected from the perinccum, which occupied but a very short time • in this separation, two small arteries were divided, and instantly secured. The ligatures were then removed from the cords and penis, and each spermatic artery tied separately. During the greater part of the operation, and especially towards its latter end, the man’s powers were greatly depressed, and two fits of syncope occurred, yet after it was finished, his pulse, though weak, could be felt at the wrist. However, in a few minutes another fit of syncope came on, from this he never rallied.” Every means to restore him, including transfusion, were in vain. The operation lasted an hour and three- quarters; this was principally occasioned by the necessity of tying so many vessels the whole of them veins, with the exception of three very small arteries, besides the two spermatics ; and by being delayed during the two fits of syncope. Although upwards of thirty ligatures were applied, not more than twenty ounces of blood were lost and of this scarcely one ounce arterial.” * * * The weight of the tumour, when removed, was 1 °U,nCeS' • Ml'- Key was decidedly of opinion, and expressed him- self to that effect, that the patient’s death was occasioned by the loss of blood which though by no means excessive, from the precautionary measures adopted, yet made an come * ?

ITS KINDS. 161 (1) Stromeyer (a) supposes that scoliosis arises, if not in all, at least in most cases rom one-sided palsy of the inspiratory muscle, viz., the m. serratus magnus. The muscle’ lthough still capable of voluntary motions, takes no part in those of breathing, which is specially observable if the motions of the diaphragm be restrained by pressure on the •elly. and the external muscles of inspiration be excited to increased activity • as then lie muscles of the palsied side remain quite quiet. This imperfect palsy is derived from he palsy of Bell's respiratory system, from an incapacity of the affected nerves pro- eeding from the periphery to reexcite reflected irritation, in which case they still obey ae stronger stimulus proceeding from the will. The greater number of cases produced i support of this opinion, permit also another explanation, and, according to what has een already said upon the aetiology of curvatures in general, is this state of palsy of le.“l's''es °f ^ration to be considered, not as a primary, but as a secondary state. According to Gunthers (6) observations, in snake-like scoliosis the muscles neither f the concave °.r convex side are much wasted, nor are they changed in form, although ,so aPPeai!s “ lonS f the7 "e attached to the body. They are only either stretched ::rffi°Ver the P:rCiTf/.°r f0lded when £ the concavities. On the mtrary, there appears a decided difference in the strength and weight of the corre- S^et>.0f tf'e two sides, and that muscle increases which has an unfavourable isition, and is therefore required to act with more power. So, for instance the m 'cullans of the concave side exceeds that of the convex about 90 grs. in a weight of ro lb lat\ss.l.mus d°rsl of the convex that of the other side about 120 Irs. in grs. If the relations of one muscle be so disproportionate that, in its natural aCt U0! at 3l1’ °r irregulariy. circumstances change, so that detaches itself from some places, attaches itself to others more suitable, or forms new [According to Zink’s opinion (c) scoliosis generally commences from the fifth to the ?hth year of age, and between the third and fifth dorsal vertebra, and thedeviation is iiiiisilSs i the muscles of respiration on that side are in a state “ ' 1 1 °™ce> it of the left.

RECURRENCE OF ANEURYSM—MORTIFICATION. 225 rm. On the following evening bleeding recurred as he was making water; the blood hich was arterial, rose in a jet five or six inches, and was in as large a stream as the ■ound would permit; it was easily stopped by pressure for an hour and then cold wet is applied. There was no further recurrence of bleedimr. and he recovered fir, +ha jn. i uni, it nudtuauj &iuppuu uy pressure ior an Hour and thei q ag applied. There was no further recurrence of bleeding, and he recovered. On the > 2th of December pulsation was felt in the radial artery. After this time nothing of ijnportance occurred, and he got well. 6 i From this case and from two or three others I have seen, I think it must be inferred tf lat when bleeding occurs at the wound after the application of a ligature, it is advis- • ble ^do as little as possible, unless the bleeding be so great that the patient’s life is in I amediate danger. Even the continuance of pressure after the blood ceases to flow had f -tter be toft al°ne, as I have already mentioned, in the treatment of some wounded •tones. 1 he strictest quietude, and the application of cold evaporating washes, should ; trusted to, and will be oftentimes successful. But the application of a ligature higher II must be always undertaken with great fear of the result, as generally the cause of 1 ant of union at the first placed ligature being a diseased state of the artery, it may be I stly dreaded that the vessel may be similarly affected still higher up, and that the * hWH-enSUtf When the ligature begins t0 I am inclined to $ >nk that if the bleeding be so severe as not to admit delay, I should amputate the nb not that the actual state of the artery would be other than if it were simply tied • ’ lt.tbe,re w°uld be he advantage, if bleeding recurred, of having the opportunity to n ply the actual cautery more efficiently than could be otherwise done; and as this ’ actice is very successful when, after amputation under ordinary circumstances the , fling up of the artery has not happened, and either without or with its extremitv I an an.eurysmal character, repeated after-bleedings occur, so I think the tual cautery might be applied successfully to a diseased artery in aneurysm — j f s lZTXr Wlth thlS SubjeCt ma-v be here mentioned the^ccasiona , t”ough rare I ™Ce of aneurysm, in a sac which had disappeared after tying the artery above it • which'tlte femoral'artery was^ied^by^t^jiraxNG1 ^of a,P°^bte^ aneurysm. 5 h//18251’handthe Pa,tleUt djsmi*sed cured on theSOti Junelo]lSwing^On’the %Oi i trjSfS swelli?g had ^ i deed its return of the size nf , lwl • but tbat slx weeks smee he had nour (on his return) occupied the lowerTlnrcTof 'the^hiffhPafilV°f ^ “,The 1 Pophteal space, aud projecting considerably on each side of th!? r T ^ Wb° 6 ,of !' nstnngs and the exterior muscles situated on the forepart of the thirl!_,the . isist o{ three lobes, and was altogether as big as an ostrich Th& ' i f aPP.eaTed to hie but distinct, the skin covering it nf g ! ostuch egg The pulsation in it was ch pain.” (p. 155.)

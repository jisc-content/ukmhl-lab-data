THE PERINJEUM INTO THE BODY OF THE BLADDER. 611 ho are often attacked with bleeding from the nose and gums; a constant bleeding often .mes on after the operation, which is nearly always fatal, and like any parenchymatous ceding, must be treated with tonics (a). 2110. Abscesses sometimes form about the neck of the bladder, which mst be encouraged to discharge their pus. If fistula should remain, it ust be treated as already directed {par. 2105) ; frequently it is in- irable. Incapability of holding the urine and impotence, which rarely continue 'ter the lateral operation for the stone, depend upon the great bruising id gangrenous destruction which the neck of the bladder has suffered ran the large size of the stone and the violence of the extension, rengthening remedies, internally and externally, as in ischuria paraly- 'a, are the alone means which may here perhaps be useful. 2111. If tlie disposition to form stone continue after the operation, it ust be counteracted by either of the already prescribed rules (par. •11—13). An instance of remarkable disposition to form stone is mentioned by Charles Phil- ?s (6), in which in the space of six years, one lithotomy and four lithotripsies were |uired.

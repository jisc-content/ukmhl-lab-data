STATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF and in greater enlargement of its natural openings. It may be produced by corpulency, by great extension of the wall of the belly during dropsy or pregnancy, by quick emaciation, by scars after wounds, especially when the injury of the abdominal wall has been connected with bruising; by diseased changes of the intestines of the belly, by loading them with coarse food, by immoderate use of relaxing drinks and the like. The occasional causes are all kinds of violence which produce great contraction of the wall of the belly and depression of the diaphragm, whereby the intestines are forcibly thrust against the former; for instance, a violent thrust or blow upon the belly, tight lacing, violent exertion on lifting heavy weights, in breathing, coughing, vomiting, in childbirth, peculiar positions, and so on. The greater the predisposing causes to rupture, the less requisite are the occasional causes; in great disposition to rupture, they often occur without any assignable occasional cause. In many countries ruptures are very common, and their causes seem to depend on climate, on the mode of living, and on the particular exertions to which the inhabitants are subjected. Ruptures occur more frequently in men than in women, and more fre- quently on the right than on the left side (1). [(1) Lawrence has given the following curious statistical account of ruptures:— *' The comparative number of the different kinds of ruptures, and the relative fre- quency of the complaint generally, as well as that of its various forms in the two sexes, and at different periods of life, are exhibited in the following statement, extracted from the register of the patients relieved by the City of London Truss Society within twenty- eight years:— In 83,584 patients, 67,798 were males, and 15,786 were females.

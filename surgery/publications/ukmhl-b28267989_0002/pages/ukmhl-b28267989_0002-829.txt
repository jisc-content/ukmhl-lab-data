IN CANCER OF THE WOMB; EXTIRPATION. 821 equally useful, and in some instances preferable. In a case of ulcer of the os uteri which we are at present attending with Dr. John Gairdner, and where the passages are much relaxed, and the uterus very low in the vagina, we have, on Dr. Gairdner’s susses- tmn, employed with much advantage a short tubular speculum of only an inch and a hal in length, and with a deficiency or opening along the course of one side of it, of sufficient size to enable us to pass our finger, for the purpose of placing the diseased part in the proper centre of the instrument. We have thus been enabled to touch easily the different applications ; while with the usual instruments it was found a very d'ffiCU t taS C t0 fix 111 11,1 s ^stance the very mobile cervix uteri.” (pp. 105, 25\4oonMe'S °-f s,!c‘cessful extirpation of prolapsed and everted womb (par. 1-89) first inclined B. Osiander to the performance of this operation for cancer of the womb, or rather of its lower part thus degenerated. UsrANDER has described two modes of performing this operation. , *lrsL~1r he fun9us is to be first removed, then the womb fixed in the bottom of the vagina by means of a thread drawn through its neck or by means of forceps, and afterwards the degenerated neck cut offbv an arch- ing cut with a curved, narrow, round-ended bistoury. The bleeding must ■ be stanched by plugging, or by styptic powder. Second.—If the greater part of the neck of the womb be destroyed by cancer, if it have spread far, and its cavity be filled with knobby, carcino- matous fungus and the mouth of the womb cannot be seized and drawn womMhiTrf^ies, the patient must be pkced in the horizontal posture, the a°bv f f °'Vn y preuSTer it * fundus, which must be fixed in the cauty of the sacrum with the forefinger of the left hand, the middle and oerf" n8?irS 1Iltrodl!ced mt0 the cavity of the womb, and whilst they ^trumem abT) T & P^ °f cu.rved-bladed «*«ors, or an extirpating \i Aoiecas Tbi 6 f™#*™ lrref£lar sc.n;rh°us parts are removed in small f cavity is then filled with sponge moistened in wine and l yp, Ic p<?wder’ and apter the bleeding is stanched a sponge dipped in lead K Zt V,"egar iV° be "P- ™>e„ -ppurat!„u °Urag by ? mixture ofextl'act of green walnut-shells, honey |he wmmdreC1 A^b UPP U?°n a Sp°n°e imraediately to the surface of lma]. r ' ,^S h6i suPPuratlon increases the mixture is to be used in Irtrp :r/P^tity and without the precipitate.

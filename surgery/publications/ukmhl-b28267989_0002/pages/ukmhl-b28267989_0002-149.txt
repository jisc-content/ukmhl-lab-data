141 OF THE WOMB. fcs \j> t* times not at all reachable, and on the hind wall ot the vagina is the fundus of the womb, descending- against the rump-bone like a lump, which on examination is felt through the rectum. [ “ In examining a case of retroflexion of the unimpregnated womb during life the finger, says Rigby, “can frequently reach a firm globular mass like a walnut situated behind the cervix uteri, and evidently posterior to the vagina. At the first touch, or to one unacquainted with this condition of the womb, it seems like a lump of scybalous matter in the rectum ; for in many, perhaps most instances, the finger cannot reach sufficiently high up to distinguish the continuity of this mass with the cervix the point of flexion being usually in the body of the uterus, close above its junction with the >cervix. 1 his, however, varies considerably, both in different cases and in the same iindividual, and at different times. In some cases the curve is much higher, so that the > whole of the uterus seems to be in the natural position, except a sharp bend or double at its uppermost portion. In others, the point of flexion is so low down that it can be easily reached, and the fundus is felt much lower than the os uteri. “ On examination per rectum we feel the same hard lump through the anterior wall of .he intestine; and by being able to reach higher up in this direction than with the finger per ■agmam, we can frequently verify or correct our first impression. But it is by the uterine sound, invented by Professor Simpson, that we obtain such peculiarly 4lSe anl nteresting results in this form of uterine displacement.

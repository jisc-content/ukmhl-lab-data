RELAXATION OF THE ANUS, OF THE RECTUM. 137 1303. The prolapse of an ensheathed upper intestine, of the lower end of the colon, of the ccccum, even of the ileum, is usually distinguished by its having some inches of length, and by its condition. The only aid consists in the return of the prolapsed part into the rectum, and in keeping- it up. If the finger be insufficient for its return, an elastic tube, and even the dashing of cold water (Boyer) must be used. A very large portion of ensheathed intestine of considerable length has been observed to separate and to be thrown off. 1 d£sTeSrfly JteLT °f ,h' m‘y WeH “ noti“ here •*» con- 1.

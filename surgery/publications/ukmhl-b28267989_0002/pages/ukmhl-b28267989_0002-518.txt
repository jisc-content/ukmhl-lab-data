COMPLICATED HYDROCELE; TREATMENT. 510 (n) CEuvres Chirurg., vol. ii. p. 441. cause it is not attached to the abdominal ring, and when this is the ij case, the water can be driven backwards and forwards. In old and 4 adherent ruptures the diagnosis may be more difficult, though it can ? be determined by a close examination, and the case may be distinguished | from a growth of the protruded parts, or from an enlargement of the ยง swelling by newly-projected parts. In the second case, examination โข $ does not present the simple elasticity of intestinal rupture, nor the ยง regularly distended condition of hydrocele, as at the part where thejl intestine is, it is more rebounding, and the fluctuation scarcely at all.il decided, and only obscurely perceivable at some spots. In this and the: H previous case, there is this peculiarity, that in long-continued hori-i zontal posture the bulk of the swelling lessens, as a part of the water,- if the neck of the sac be not entirely closed, by the adherence of the'* rupture itself, returns into the belly ; on the contrary, in long-continued- standing, the swelling enlarges, by the re-descent of the water. In the* third and fourth cases, the diagnosis may indeed be difficult ; here,, however, the history of the disease, as well as a certain fulness of the inguinal region, immediately above the external abdominal ring, directs-j the practitioner, as well as the circumstance, that if the rupture follow a pre-existing hydrocele, instead of the appearance of the fulness in the* ino-uinal region, the water is returned with more difficulty into the. cavity of the belly, and that it returns freely, when the rupture has.; entirely, or, for the most part, been reduced by the previous attempts't at reduction acting on the region of the abdominal ring. 1971. The treatment of hydrocele accompanied with rupture, is espe- cially directed in reference to the condition of the latter, whether it be movable or adherent. 1972. With a movable rupture, a cut an inch in length is first made-, through the skin, so as to return the intestine, the exposed rupture-sac is then lifted up with the forceps, and a slight opening made in it with the scissors for the purpose of introducing an injection-tube, through which, > the abdominal ring being carefully closed, one of the above-mentioned^ injections {par. 1951) may be thrown in to excite adhesive inflammation, and with moderate compression, to produce union. After the reduction off the rupture, this may be effected by making a cut and introducing a tent. - A truss must be worn till the complete adhesion of the sac has beent effected, and even longer. Desault (cl) first emptied the water by a puncture with a trocar, then whilst thei canula was remaining in, replaced the rupture, and injected red wine. 1973. When the rupture is adherent, and the adhesions are firm and considerable, the treatment, with an intestinal rupture, must be merely confined to palliation by puncturing with a lancet, after previously making! a cut through the skin, or opening the exposed rupture-sac as in thM operation for strangulated rupture, and by the use of a suspendor. Con- genital omental rupture allows an earlier radical cure of hydrocele, as the- omentum more readily assumes the process of adhesive inflammation. I>> however, the union be slight, which may be determined by the possibility of reducing the greater part of the rupture, the sac must be earefuliyj opened by a cut as in the operation for hydrocele, the adhesions divide*^ the taxis employed, and then by introducing a tent of lint a sufhcien

The flap thus marked is now taken hold of with the left hand and firmly drawn, so that with some smart strokes of the knife the whole of the soft parts, including the plantar arteries, should be shaved off close to the bones, as far back as the points of the ankles. The anterior ligament is then cut through, and the line of the joint laid bare, but with- out opening it further, the saw is placed upon it, and worked from before backwards, so as not merely to remove the malleolar processes, but also the hind edge of the tibial mortise, in order to make the surface level, and eaving the joint-cartilage only in front and in the middle, so thatithardlv forms a third of the whole bony surface. The ligaments and soft parts untouched are now to be separated with the knife and the Achilles’ ten- don scraped off as closely as possible to the heel-bone. The posterior and ! anterior tibial arteries require tying, and the flap dropping by its own weight upon the wound is fixed with sutures.

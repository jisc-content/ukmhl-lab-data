TREATMENT. 145 Schweighaeuser considers it unnecessary, in which opinion Schmitt also concurs, as by emptying the bladder with the catheter, and the intes- tinal canal with opening clysters, and the previous use of neutral salts with carefully observed position on the side, the rump being raised and the upper part of the body bent down, nearly always the effect is produced and the womb gradually resumes its natural position, whilst also the swelling gradually subsides. This may be assisted, if with two fingers introduced daily into the vagina, the base of the womb be raised gra- dually but carefully. If the symptoms be inflammatory, merely mild remedies, emulsions of linseed or almond oil, fresh castor oil, luke-warm bathing, steaming, by means of a sponge laid on the generative organs relaxing poultices upon the belly, and even general and local blood- letting, and copiously rubbing in mercurial ointment on the insides of the thighs. When the most pressing symptoms have been removed or les- sened, then the replacement is to be especially attended to. Only when retroversion of the womb exists without any appearance of acute inflam- nation, may the replacement be at once attempted, but it must not be too ong continued. As to the manipulation of the replacement, all that has ieen said heretofore applies. n !?!?* )VIT the WOmJb is returned to its place, it has rarely a disposition o be displaced anew, and the continued position on the side, is sufficient to •rev ent it. And besides as the womb enlarges during pregnancy, its retro ersion is no longer possible. If there be% special disposition to reJro ersion, a round or oval pessary, with a pretty large aperture or a suffi T baml?6 °f Sp°nge introduced int0 the vagina and fastened with T bandage, will prevent it.

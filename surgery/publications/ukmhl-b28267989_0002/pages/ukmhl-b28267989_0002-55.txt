47 WITHOUT OPENING THE SAC. not recommend its adoption, being unwilling to introduce without absolute necessity a new difficulty into an operation, always requiring consideration and caution, and fre- quently attended with embarrassing circumstances.” (p. 290.) F i oin my own personal experience of the division of the stricture external to the sac } cau saJ aching, never having performed it. But I do not think so great ad van face is gained by not opening the sac, as is stated. From all the cases I have observed either in the practice of others or in my own, I do not think cutting through the her- nial sac, and consequently opening the peritoneal cavity, so serious as generally consi- deied. If inflammation of the peritoneum have not been previously set up, either by the rough usage of the rupture, or by the irritation which a long strangulated or gam grenous gut produces, I cannot understand why making a small opening into the peri- toneal cavity should be more dreaded than the long slits, which are now made without compunction, for the removal of diseased ovaries, and so forth. There are, however ft To? Hdi °nS "’ !,1Ch eVeD,th0Se ^ho advise having the sac untouched, admit, require that it should be opened, namely, confinement of the protruded parts by entangling bands or by adhesion to the sac itself, and a gangrenous condition of the bowelS Under all’ circumstances therefore am still disposed to continue the practice of opening the sa" as I have hitherto done, believing it to be the most safe. I cannot conclude thfse obser ’ vat ions without stating that I believe much of the fatality attendant on operations for strangulated ruptures, depends on the improper after-treatment.

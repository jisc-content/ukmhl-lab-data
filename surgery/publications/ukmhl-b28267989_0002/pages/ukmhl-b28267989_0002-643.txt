[ 635 ] 3 STATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF THE OPERATIONS FOR THE STONE IN ST. THOMAS’S HOSPITAL, from 1800 to 1846. The following is the account of operations for the stone which have been performed i St. Thomas’s Hospital since 1800 ; and I have to thank my friend Nash for the kind sslstance he has rendered me from the steward’s office books, which unhappily are, nth but few exceptions, the only records kept before 1820. I have also used Green’s ase-books, some of which are missing, Clark’s, and my own books, the ward books, nd the Lancet, from which I have derived great assistance. In the first table are the gross number of cases operated on in each year. In the ;cond table I have given the dates and the results, with the circumstances of the cases •here important, as far as I have been able to obtain them. I am sorry, however, iat the reports are so meagre, but still they are highly important, as showing that the iteral operation is neither so dangerous, nor so much to be dreaded, if the after-treat- lent be well attended to; and also that the cutting gorget does not deserve the obloquy hich of late years it has been the fashion so freely to heap upon it. In the cases recorded in the second table, the gorget was always used by the elder 'ravers, Green, Mackmurdo, the younger Travers, and myself; Tvrrell, Solly, ad Clark operated with Blizard’s knife, its beak, however, being straight.

The Initials under the Surgeon’s column mark the operator. Up to 1837, the elder 'ravers, Green, and Tyrrell, alone operated; but in that year, whilst Assistant argeon, was my first operation. After the retirement of Travers, and my appoint- ient as Surgeon, in 1841, Mackmurdo, Solly, and the younger Travers, became Assistants; and on the death of Tyurel, in 1843, Mackmurdo took his place, and 'Lark became junior Assistant.

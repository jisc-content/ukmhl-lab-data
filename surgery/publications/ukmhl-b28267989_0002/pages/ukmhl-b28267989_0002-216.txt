208 TREATMENT OF ANEURYSM. 1415. Compression and ligature of the aneurysmatic arteries are the two modes of treatment which especially apply to the cure of external* aneurisms! They agree with each other in effecting the obliteration oi the artery ; this takes place slowly by compression, in which case the circidation is gradually restored by the collateral branches, but occur* ciuickly on tying the artery. Only in a spurious aneurysm, which arises ?“m Zwo J if an artery! and has not long existed cmma cure by com- nression be effected, without subsequent closure of the artery, as has neei Edygrafted in wounds of arteries, under certain c.rcumstances (par, 27?4V) Compression has been employed upon the aneurysmal swelling, above it, anZ a swathing of the whole limb.

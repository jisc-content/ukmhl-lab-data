FORM AND SITUATION. 545 [“Calculous disorders,”observes Brodie, “prevail differently in different classes of society, among individuals of different ages, and in different climates and districts, it Among the lower classes, children are much more liable to calculi than adult per- sons. You know how large a proportion of our hospital patients admitted for litho- tomy are children. On the other hand, in private practice, that is, among the 1 upper classes of society, very few of our patients are children, and the great i majority are persons above fifty years of age. Nor are these things of difficult a.' explanation. The great majority of calculi are originally composed of lithic 1 (uric) acid, that is, have a lithic acid nucleus. * * * In all classes, persons of a t middle age are less frequently affected by stone in the bladder than those who are $■ younger or older.” (p. 253.) These observations are confirmed by the following analysis of three hundred and h fifty-four cases, between the ages of two and of seventy-nine years, which has been given H' by Smith, of Bristol (a), together with the results of the operation, which was per- o formed on all, seven only of the number being females, of whom two were under • ■ ten years, three between ten and twenty, one between twenty and thirty, and one between thirty and forty. “ 135 65 35 34 37 28 18 2 Analysis of 354 Cases of Lithotomy, from 2 years to 10 ; Cured, 106 ; Died, 29, or one death in 4i 10 20 52 20 30 30 30 40 27 40 50 26 50 60 22 60 70 11 70 79 1 13 5 5 7 7 5 11 3J 6 4? 7 2§ 1 2 354 275 79 4A-’ 1 iJ!aITHi,eStl-m!JteS ,he number of stone-operations in the provinces at 90;’ in the Il67 d<in tl?SPltv.Sl at/!’ ^nd,m London private practice, at 30; making a total of I i ' ■ u ,the. whole,of Scotland, at 12; in Ireland, the same; and that, if we take 1 ,n/ound numbers at 200, we shall have the very extreme point of cal- 2 Hi' fS fo,r.our wh°le population.

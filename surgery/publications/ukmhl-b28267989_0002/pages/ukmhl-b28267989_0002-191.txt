DIVISION OF TENDONS. 183 _ - ® ination, and so on, are too easily excited by the extending force ; it is therefore best to j commence the setting straight first when the little wound has healed, (Stromeyer, Dieffenbach, Stoess, myself, and others,) (2), and not immediately after the operation (Thilenius, Michaelis, Sartorius, Delpech, Bouvier, Pauli, Duval, Blasius.) f(l) When I first began to operate on cases of varus, I had not any opportunity of either beiug acquainted with or seeing Stromeyer’s apparatus, which I think is by far the best instrument for treating these cases I know of, aud I used Boyer’s splint for fractured thigh, with the shoe, which I first fastened on the foot, and then having fixed it upon the projecting bar, gradually, from day to day, drew down the upper end of the splint to the plane of the thigh-bone as the patient could bear it; for although when the shoe was firmly fixed, the length of the splint was so great, that it produced such powerful leverage as to overcome every resistance to placing the foot immediately in its proper position, yet I was afraid of attempting it at once, on account of the violence which would have been needed, and the pain the patient would have suffered; for even in the way I used it, the patient suffered considerably from the stress of the shoe-straps, and constantly sought to relieve himself, so that almost daily the foot was found more or less displaced, however well it had been arranged on the previous day, and therefore the progress of the cure retarded. I therefore altered my plan, and instead of at once attempting to turn the sole down and flex the leg upon the foot, I first endeavoured to get the foot straight with the leg, leaving the toe pointed, and the heel raised, or in other words, to convert the club-foot into horse-foot, and afterwards gradually to flex the foot on the leg from day to day. The first part of the proceeding was effected by Boyer’s splint and shoe, with the simple alteration of making the foot-bar, upon which the shoe was fixed, round instead of square, so that when the bar was entered into its socket, the sole of the foot was readily turned down without making any flexion upon the leg, the socket moving on the oar as the toe pointed, which it is always first disposed to do after the division of the Achilla’ tendon. After a few days, when the patient had become accustomed to this new position, I began gradually to flex the foot on the leg, by slipping the foot-piece nto the foot-piece of the stirrup apparatus for fractured knee-cap, the circular bandage )f which was fixed above the knee, and then gradually shortened the screw rod as the oatient could bear the stress upon the ball of the great toe, which was considerable. This answered the purpose, but it was a very clumsy contrivance, and I soon managed o contrive a more simple and efficacious instrument, which consisted of a pair of long larrow splints, like Boyer’s splint, one for the outside, and the other for the inside of he leg and thigh, which were connected at bottom by the circular bar on which the foot- nece moved, and upon the leg and thigh, by three or four straps and buckles. For lexing the foot, a stud was placed on each edge of the foot-piece, near its toe end, upon .ach of which a leather strap fastened, by which the toe end of the foot-piece could be trawn up, and the foot flexed on the leg, to such extent as might be wished ; and this leing determined, the other end of each strap was fastened on a stud in the side of the [orresponding splint upon the thigh. This apparatus I have used very frequently and successfully, and with children it erves every purpose required, if the Surgeon be content to restore the straight position ' the foot first, and afterwards to flex it. The instrument has the advantage of being asily made by a common carpenter and smith, and with little expense, even if a new SraowJwl f°r eTierjlCaSe treatecL 1 do not presume to put in it competition with Z ’ 051E'f;us excellent apparatus, which cannot always be obtained when required is ■»- pensive, and needs some little practice for its proper employment.

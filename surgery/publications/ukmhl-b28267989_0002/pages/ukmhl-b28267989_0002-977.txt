Moreau, father and son, peiformed it on the latter, and at the ankle- and wrist-joint; White, and afterwards Mulder (2), proposed it for the head of the thigh-bone; von Graefe (a) undertook it at the jaw-joint, and Davie (b) on the collar- bone. It was subjected to the closest examination by Sabatier, Percy (e) Roux, Moreau the son, Larrey (d), and Guthrie (e), and much valuable experience in reference to it has been published. But the many and favourable results obtained by the English and German Surgeons, J-EXTpRj and Jaeger, have contributed to extend the employment ot this practice and by their successful issue have contradicted many of the objections to it.

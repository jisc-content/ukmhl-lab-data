As soon as the polyp is tied it begins to swell and become t painful; in a few days it crumples up and mortifies, and a stinking ichor nows fiom the nostril. The pain is often very severe, and the inflam- f mation spreads; under these circumstances the loop must be slackened a p little. If the polyp swell up so much as to produce symptoms, the loop must be so tightened, that all influx of blood into the polyp be prevented, I tand the polyp may also be scarified at the same time. When there is 1 bleeding the loop must also be well tightened. To lessen the nasty smell ^ a,TC;d !chor’ ln.)‘ections of aromatic herbs or of diluted acids are often made.

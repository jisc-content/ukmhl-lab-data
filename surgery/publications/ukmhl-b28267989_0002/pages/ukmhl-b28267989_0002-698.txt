The fatty, or adipose tumour, depends on an unnatural collect! »| of fat, heaped up either m the panniculus adiposus, or between the plait | of the cellular tissue beneath the skin, according to Schreger, ki t mucous bags of the first and second orders. 2242. These tumours are developed slowly, and without any unea ness; they give to the touch a peculiar softness, whieh cannot be betl compared than to that of a bag filled with cotton ; their surface is irr gular, and distinct conglomerations are felt upon them, which are not han and are easily compressed. When they have reached a certain size, th. in general grow quickly, and may acquire a very considerable bulk. . long as the swelling is small, the skin upon it remains unchanged,!) when it has become very large, the circulation is impeded by the dragging and tension of the skin, the cutaneous veins become expanded, dropsic- swelling takes place, the skin inflames, especially if the tumour be seat* on any part where it can be affected by chafing or external injury, ai the inflammation may run on to ulceration. The form of a fatty tumw is in general oblong, and has a neck. .. . [That fatty tumours have generally a neck is not, according to my obserTatic eorrect. They usually have a broad base, and raise up the skin like hlilock;\ , , rarely they have a neck; and in St. Thomas’s Museum is the cast of a ver> ri . . one, which weighed from fifty to sixty pounds, was attached by a narrow J* the throat, and hung down to the man’s knees.

According to the two-fold origin of fatty tumours already tioned, {par. 2241,) two different kinds may be distinguished wlucn characterized by marked symptoms. Aimarn Those fatty tumours which belong merely to the panniculus and are only knobby masses of fat at certain parts, have no ''e , a] edges, but subside into the surrounding parts, (IJpoma diffus*™-) ^ very soft and easily compressible, and so connected with the s n> ^ latter can be moved or lifted in folds upon the swelling. meptfaB under the generally thinned corium ; no general sac exists, an< '■o' *7 | only are enclosed in thin and simple walls. The fat is similar ■ other parts of the body, only a little firmer.

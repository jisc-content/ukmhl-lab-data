Des- Iiamps (b) followed out this proposal with unsatisfactory result ; so also stley Cooper (c). From these cases it has been improperly deter- ined to reject this practice unconditionally (d), as it can only answer our pectations if no branches arise from the artery betioeen the seat of liga- ► and the sac, or from the sac itself (e). This opinion is confirmed by c observations of Wardrop (/), Lambert (g), Evans (h), Bushe (i) ott (h), and Montgomery (7), who, in aneurysm of the carotid M tery, have tied the vessel above the swelling, and effected a cure. • Iupuytren supposes that the small branches between the sac and the seat of ligature .y become useful, as they proportionally afford a passage for the blood, and prevent • too great extension and tearing of the sac.

The operation of tying the artery beyond the aneurysmal sac, was according to Boyer , iposed nearly sixty years since by Brasdor in his lectures, but never performed by u; it was also recommended by Desault, as feasible where it was not possible to tie i vessel between the heart and the sac, but neither did he perform it. The operation, wever, was at last undertaken by Deschamps, in a man of sixty years old, who had a ■ uoral aneurysm, seventeen inches in circumference, so high up that there was not a ; i ger’s breadth between the sac and Poupart’s lieament.

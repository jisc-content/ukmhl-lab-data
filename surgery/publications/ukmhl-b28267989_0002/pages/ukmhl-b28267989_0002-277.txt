269 ANEURYSMAL VARIX. vitli diminution of the pulse in the lower part of the artery, with a diminu- ion of temperature, sensation, and motion of the parts below the aneurysmal arix, which fall into a state of complete torpor. Breschet (n) has proved, by careful observation and experiment, that in the systole he blood flows out of the artery into the vein; and in the diastole, out of the vein into he artery; and that, on the latter condition depend, the enlargement of the lower part of he artery, which is often tortuous, and of which, on account of its weaker pulsation, it has een falsely asserted that it is diminished in diameter, as well as the other circumstances ud changes of the arterial walls, into a condition similar to that of the veins. By he passage of the arterial blood into the veins, the walls of the latter are thickened, and esemble, in a degree, those of arteries. As in the extremities, the passage of the blood rom the vein into the artery takes place more readily than in aneurysmal varix on the eck and head; so he explains how the symptoms are milder, and why in the latter ften only during the horizontal position of the head, symptoms as fainting, and the like ccur, they being grounded on the overflow of the blood from the vein into the arteryâ€™ [Sevnertus (6) is first considered to have described aneurysmal varix; his descrin-

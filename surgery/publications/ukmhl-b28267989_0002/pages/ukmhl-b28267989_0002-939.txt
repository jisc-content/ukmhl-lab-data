OF EXARTICULATION. 931 In cutting the finger off with a chisel, (.Dactylosmileum, Lat.,) the finger must be laid on its dorsal surface on a little wooden block, and held by an assistant, who at the same time draws the skin back: a sharp chisel, as wide again as the finger, is to be placed vertically on the palmar surface, and held with the left hand, and the finger is struck off with a smart blow from a wooden mallet. In this way, which is generally objected to as rough and barbarous, and only recommended by G-raefe and Jaeger, there is not any splintering; the operation is quick and 1 e painful, and the cure is not more tedious than in the operation with the circular cut (a). fcSlYrwa the rem0Val °£the PJlalanx b7 a peculiar instrument, the tachytome, with which, at the same time, sufficient flaps of the soft parts are formed.

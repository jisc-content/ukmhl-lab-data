The latter consist of a strap of fustian leather, or the like, and of a pad. When applied, they may not yield to the movements of the coverings of the belly, may therefore be very easily displaced, the intestines slip from them, and if this be pre\ ented by drawing tight, painful pressure is produced. Upon these grounds the inelastic trusses are to be altogether rejected. 1‘ Elast.lc fusses consist of, first, a spring; second, a pad; and. , [ * clrcuIar “trap.

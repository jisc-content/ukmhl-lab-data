At other times the effused blood infiltrates the more solid parts of the tumour, and produces an appearance which by Laennec has been well compared to an apoplectic clot. The more solid parts of the tumour differ in a marked manner from that which composes the scirrhous tumour. In this disease, the secondary cysts, which are often of large size, generally become filled with a material which at first bears a considerable resem- blance to tender or feebly coagulated fibrin or plastic lymph. Into this substance new vessels speedily shoot; but being neither susceptible of perfect organization, nor calcu- lated to remain inert and dormant, it speedily, but gradually loses its vitality, and, like other transparent parts in which such a change is effected, gradually becomes opaque, and bears, in consistence and appearance, a-close resemblance to the substance of the brain of a child; hence the terms, cerebriform cancer, encephaloid tumour and medullar y sarcoma. * * * Although in fungoid disease, the solid part of the tumour often bears a striking resemblance to cerebral substance, we frequently find it, on the one hand, deviating into a much more firm material, and, on the other hand, into one of a softer and grumous consistence. Sometimes it has a minutely foliated structure of a pearly white colour. When the diseased structure has completely lost its vitality, it breaks down into a variously discoloured pultaceous grumous mass, in which the remains of the membranes of the secondary cysts and their vessels may often be detected. Although in a recently formed tumour, or in the newer parts of an older one the traces of that mode of formation on which I have insisted are sufficiently evident” they are very much lost or obscured, as the progress of decay advances. It is also at times difficult to distinguish it when the tumour has only advanced to the stage of opacity, provided the substance of the tumour be very uniform, and the membranous parts not only very thin and tender, but adherent amongst themselves and to the eon- tamed substance.” (p. 333-37.)

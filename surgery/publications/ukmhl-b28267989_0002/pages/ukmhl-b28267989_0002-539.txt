SYMPTOMS. 531 l between the fingers, without the fragments, which are connected by the little hairs, being separated; but they remain hanging together in a sort of cluster. >. These hairs can be separated only by maceration. Magendie cabs this hairy i- gravel (aravelle pile use) ; it consists of phosphate of lime, and some magnesia, and ion uric acid. Gueranger (e) speaks of a gravel composed of silica. In reference to xanthic oxide gravel, see par 1998. 2010. The symptoms of gravel are very various; sometimes it causes ■ little or no inconvenience ; often only in making water : frequently it is ,i. accompanied with pain or weight in the loins ; the kidneys, ureters, bladder, i and urethra may be, however, severely irritated; and suppression of ^ urine, inflammation, and fever, may result from it. In most cases it is 8< accompanied with disturbance of the digestive organs, acidity of the 3i stomach, flatulence, and the like. Patients labouring under this disease n frequently complain of heat and dryness in the throat and gullet, and are | therefore constantly hawking and spitting. The complaint is often accom- 6 panied with organic disease of the kidneys, or of the urinary passages. The general health and appearance will often remain good for a lon°- • 'vhile with deposits of uric acid (1) : but phosphatic gravel is always ac- iqicoinpanied with symptoms of increased sensibility and irritability, general v weakness, disturbed digestion, and unhealthy pale countenance. In I phosphatic gravel, the urine is most generally pale, after standing some i time a glistening film is formed on its surface, which consists chiefly of ^phosphates; little crystals often attach themselves to the vessel. The fti -pecific gravity of the urine is often very much altered ; and it very Readily becomes putrid (2).

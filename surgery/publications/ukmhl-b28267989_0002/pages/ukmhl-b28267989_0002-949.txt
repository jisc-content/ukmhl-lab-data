The integuments having- retracted, the m. glutams maximus is to be cut from its insertion in the linea aspera and the tendons of the m. glutams medius and minimus from the top of the trochanter major The Surgeon now placing the edge of the knife on the line of the retracted muscles of the first incision, cuts steadily through the whole of the others blood vessels, &c., on the inside of the thigh. The artery and vein or two arteries and a vein of the profunda is given off high up, are to be taken between the fingers and thumb of the left hand, until the Surgeon can draw each vessel out with the tenaculum, and place a ligature upon it Whilst this is doing the assistants should press with their finders on any small vessels that bleed. The Surgeon then cuts through the small muscles running to be inserted between the trochanters and those on the upper part of the thigh, not yet divided ; and with a large scalpel opens into the capsular ligament, the bone being strongly moved outwards* bv which its round head puts the ligament o'n the stretch. Havlg exten- sively divided it on the fore part and inside, the ligamenturn feres may now be readily cut through. The head of the bone is then easily dS cated, and two or three strokes of the knife separate any attachment the Sed^T e l aV6I t0r ^ ^• ,The V6SSeh are "°£ carefully to be secured.

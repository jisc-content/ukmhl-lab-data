DIAGNOSIS. 479 According to Laennec, slight effusions, as, under a pound, cause no decided symptoms; **< >ut those exceeding two or three pounds, are shown by percussion, auscultation, and in- : ii pection. £ jn Some cases of considerable pericardial dropsy, the breast-bone exhibits a remark- »s ible elevation. Piorry believes that a careful measurement would show greater disten- t ion of the left side from above downwards, or from the one side to the other. In one ( ase (a) the liver was so thrust down, that its lower edge projected two inches below the dge of the false ribs. If but little fluid be collected, it makes little pressure towards >; he sides of the pericardium ; therefore percussion discovers a dull sound, rather from J- bove downwards, than from side to side. This dull sound varies according to the dif- j erent posture of the patient, on his back, whilst sitting, or in lying on his side; the . • hange of place of the dull sound in the side posture is of less value than when on the * ack, or sitting, because it depends on displacement of the heart. In large collections r- f water, the stroke of the heart is, according to Bocillaud, deeper, less to be felt, and *> he accompanying murmur more obscure, less perceptible at a distance than in the i I atural state; and if to these symptoms be added a duller sound, the existence of dropsy ,v f the pericardium is exceedingly probable, even if it be not quite certain. (' According to Piorry, in large collections of water a perfectly dull sound is found in « pyramidal space; the base of which is the region of the heart, and the point at the MEBtj pper part of the breast-bone. [ Gendrin thinks that there is stabbing pain on the left side of the chest towards the ® boulder, arm, and back, opposite the base of the heart; or it may be confined to the o egion of the stomach on the outer edge of the ensiform cartilage, and is rarely want- lg; the point of the heart is displaced inwards and upwards to the top of the third S ib, and on account of the oblique position, of the large vessels thus caused, at the h lace of their opening, a rubbing noise is observed at the base of the heart, in the arch n f the aorta, and in the arteria innominata, which noise diminishes in proportion as the S - uid is absorbed. [' Hypertrophy and expansion of the heart may be distinguished by their slow origin, by i ie various condition of the beating of the heart, and by7 the dull sound, by the various Kji.ondition of the pericardium, and the dull sound in a round space. (Pigne.) El 1905. The quantity of water in the pericardium is various, and some- t .mes amounts to many pounds; it is usually like albumen, yellowish, f fhitish, reddish, and, when arising merely from a perverse secretion, is :(> naccompanied with any diseased change of the heart, or of the pericar- ) ium{b). Frequently is the pericardium united to the neighbouring ■arts, and thickened; the surface of the heart is inflamed, excoriated, ts imetimes covered with layers of purulent matter ; sometimes the water is |/)und in sacs attached to the heart or to the pericardium. At the same * me> other organic diseases of the heart, of the large vessels, and luno-s u re founcl> winch in many cases are the cause, and in other the conse- s: uence, of the pericardial dropsy, and therefore the fluid is of a different jvature. Chronic inflammation of the heart or its sac, wounds and the like ia) give rise to it: and predisposition thereto frequently originates in it regnancy and childbed. ° X /examX^v186^ 1jfla?Tnlation °f tIie pericardium runs on to suppuration: there is | he sJX'L°f h'S Vn.d W !'ch -has been 111 the Museum at St. Thomas’s many years. . , ?er was nnnei^T^^ f*J*e Pu of the stomach, and, being supposed an abscess of the ■1 rirnrdium h<?

100 GENEBAL PATHOLOGY OE IKJtJElES. SECTION II. General Pathology oe Injuries. WOUNDS. Wounds are divided into two great classes, the open, and tlie subcutaneous. Open wounds.â€”A wound has been defined as "a solution of continuity in any part of the body, suddenly made by anything that cuts or tears, with division of the skin." Here our attention will be confined to the general pathology and treatment of wounds of the soft tissues. Wounds of special tissues, as bone, muscle, blood- vessels, neryes, &c.^ will be further referred to under those heads. The process of repair in open wounds of the soft tissues differs according as the wound is incised, lacerated, contused, or punctured, and according as it is, or is not, kept aseptic, properly drained, and protected from iufec- tive processes. The healing process will, moreover, be infiuenced by the patient's state of health previous to the wound, and the hygienic conditions under which he is subsequently placed. Let us first take a general view of the process of repair as it occurs in a simple incised wound in a healthy subject. Immediately the wound is infiicted there will be free hsemorrhage varying in amount according to the vascularity of the part, probably a spouting of blood in jets from a few larger arteries, and a more or less general oozing from the smaller vessels and capillaries. The heemorrhage from the larger arteries having been arrested, and that from the smaller having ceased spontaneously, the wound, if accurately closed, and kept aseptic and at rest with its surfaces in contact, will unite without suppuration by a process of simple or adhesive inflammation. Thus, the edges of the wound for the first day or two may present a very faint blush of red- ness extending for a few lines to perhaps in a large wound half an inch or so beyond the incision; whilst they may

DISEASES OF REGIONS. 738 whence they pass into the bladder, and there increase in size by the successive deposit upon them of the same or other of the urinary salts. The calculi most frequently met with in this situation are (1) the uric acid; (2) the oxalate of lime, and (3) the fusible or mixed phosphates. The rarer forms are (4) the urate of ammonia; (5) the cystic oxide or cystine; (6) the phosphate of lime; (7) the phosphate of ammonia and magnesia, or triple phos- phate ; (8) the carbonate of lime ; (9) the xanthic or uric oxide; (10) the fibrinous; (11) the blood; (12) the uro- stealith; and (13) the silicious. The last seven being exceedingly rare, are not described. 1. The uric acid calculi are the most common. They are generally of moderate size, oval, and laterally Fig. 285.—Oxalate of Ume Fig. 286.—Section of oxalate of calculus. lime calculus. compressed, of a nut-brown colour, smooth or finely granular, moderately heavy and hard, and laminated on section. They are completely destroyed in the blow-pipe flame, giving off a smell of burnt feathers. They are insoluble in nitro-hydrochloric acid, but soluble in warm alkalies. When treated by nitric acid and evaporated to dryness, on the addition of a drop of ammonia a purple colour is produced [murexide test). The nucleus is gene- rally composed of uric acid, sometimes of oxalate of lime, and is generally formed in the kidney. These calculi occur most frequently in youth and middle age, 2. The oxalate oe lime, or mulberry calculi (Eigs. 285, 286), as they are often called from their resem- blance, when first removed covered with blood from the bladder, to a mulberry, are generally of moderate size, globular in shape, usually of a dark-brown or mahogany colour, rough and tuberculated, very hard and heavy, and crystalline on section. They are only partially destroyed

This, however, would appear to be contrary to the experience of Surgeons generally, the stricture re- turning (though less rapidly), as it does after all methods of treatment, if a bougie is not occasionally passed. For strictures in front of the scrotum, internal urethrot- omy is a yery successful operation; but in deeper situa- tions it has been followed by abscess, severe haemorrhage, extravasation of urine, cystitis, nephritis, and pyaemia. It would appear to be attended with a mortality ranging from 1 to 3 per cent. External urethrotomy, or opening the urethra from the perineum, may be required for two distinct conditions. 1. For certain strictures which, though pervious to instruments, are of an intractable nature. Fig. 303.—Otis' urethrotome. Here the operation known as Syme's should be done. 2. For strictures, through which even after the utmost perseverance, an instrument cannot be passed. In these cases the stricture may be divided by Wheelhouse's modification of the old method of perineal section; or the urethra may be opened by Cock's method, i,e,, behind the stricture at the apex of the prostate, and the stricture left undivided in the hope that, relieved from the pressure and irritation of the urine, it may become pervious to instruments. Syme^s method of external urethrotomy or perineal section.—Syme advised this operation for—1, irritable, and 2, contractile strictures "that are indomitable by the ordinary means of treatment." For such, however, internal urethrotomy is now generally preferred, and Syme's operation reserved for 3, indurated and cartila- ginous strictures, complicated by intractable perineal fistulae where dilatation has failed. Introduce Syme's shouldered staff (Fig. 304) so that the slender part passes through the stricture into the bladder, and the shoulder of the thicker part rests against the face of the stricture.

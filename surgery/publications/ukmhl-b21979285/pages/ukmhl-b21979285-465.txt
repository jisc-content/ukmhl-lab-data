DISLOCATIONS OF BONES OF THE HAND. 449 I Dislocations of the carpal and metacarpal BONES are very rare. Their diagnosis is usually obvious. The phalanges of the fingers may be dislocated backwards or forwards. Eeduction is easily effected by extension and manipulation. Dislocation of the metacarpal hone of the thumb from the trapezium may occur in a backward or forward direction, and is easily reduced by extension or pressure. Dislocation of the first phalanx of the thumb from the metacarpal bone is of more importance. The phalanx is FiCt. 135.—Dislocation of the thumb backwards at the metacarpo- phalangeal joint. (After Agnew.) nearly always displaced backwards; the shortening of the thumb and the projections of the base of the phalanx and head of the metacarpal bone serve for its diagnosis. Eeduc- tion is often very difficult; this is usually ascribed to the head of the metacarpal bone being forced between the two insertions of the flexor brevis pollicis by which its neck is tightly embraced. (Fig. 135.) Sir George Humphry, however, has shown that the hindrance to reduction depends upon the fact that the sesamoid bones and the ligaments connecting them are carried back with the phalanx, and being held there by the flexor brevis and intervening between the metacarpal bone and the phalanx, prevent the articular surfaces of the bones being brought into contact. Treatment,—Press the metacarpal bone well into the palm of the hand to relax the flexor brevis W. G G

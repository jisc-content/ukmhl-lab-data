RLTPTIJRE OF THE BLADDER. 427 Or the bladder may be inflated with hydrogen ; if there is a rupture the abdomen becomes distended and the liver dulness lost; if the bladder is sound a localized tympanitic tumour rises from the pelvis. Later sym- ptoms of peritonitis or of pelvic cellulitis will probably supervene. , Treatment.—The following are the chief plans of treat- ment that have been adopted:—1. The retention of a soft catheter just within the bladder. 2. Washing out the bladder and adjoining portion of the peritoneal cavity with an antiseptic solution by a catheter passed through the rent in the viscus. 3. Washing out and drainage Figs. 122 and 123.—Method of applying Lembert's suture in ruptured bladder. (After Sir W. MacCormac.) through an incision in the perineum. 4. Opening the abdomen, sewing up the rent in the bladder, and washing out the peritoneal cavity if the rupture is intra-peritoneal. Of these methods the last, provided every care is taken to ensure perfect closure of the rent in the bladder, and thorough cleansing of the peritoneum by irrigation, holds out, in the intra-peritoneal rupture, the best prospect of success. Several cases have now been treated success- fully in this way; amongst the first of these may be men- tioned, two by Sir William MacCormac, one by Mr. Holmes, and one by myself. In sewing up the bladder the peritoneal surfaces should be brought into contact by Lembert's sutures (Fig. 123), which should not pass through the mucous membrane. And one suture at least should be placed beyond the angles of the wound so as to prevent leakage at these spots (Fig. 122). After the rent has been closed an antiseptic fluid should be injected into the bladder to make sure that the viscus is watertight.

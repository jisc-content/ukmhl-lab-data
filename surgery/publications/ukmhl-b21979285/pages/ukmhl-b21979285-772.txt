Having assured your- self that the stone is grasped by the forceps in its smallest diameter, extract it by making traction downwards and backwards in the axis of the pelvic outlet. Re-introduce the finger into the bladder to ascertain whether there may not be another stone, and if in doubt nse the searcher. Inject two or three syringef uls of cold water into the bladder ; dust the wound with iodoform; apply no dressings; tie the legs to- gether if the patient is a child, and send him back to bed as quickly as possible. If there is haemorrhage, tie any bleeding point which is seen, or if the blood comes from the deep part of the wound, introduce the petti- coated tube (Fig. 294), assur- ing yourself that the end is in the bladder by injecting water and passing a probe through it. Then plug firmly round with strips of lint be- tween the petticoat and the tube. At Guy's Hospital lateral lithotomy is performed on a straight staff, by the opera- tion known as Key's. A good description of the me- thod will be found in Bryant's Surgery. The structures divided in the operation are—1, the skin ; 2, the superficial and deep fascia; 3, a few branches of the external hoemorrhoidal vessels and nerves; 4, the transversus perinei muscle, vessels, and nerve; e5, a few fibres of the accelerator urinee and levator ani muscles; 6, the compressor urethrse muscle; 7, the membraneous portion of the urethra; and 8, the prostate. The dangers of the operation are : — A. Before the point of the knife has entered the groove in the staff— 1, wounding the rectum, either from cutting too perpen- dicularly, or from not having had it cleared out by an Fig. 294.—Petticoated tube.

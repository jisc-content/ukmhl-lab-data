421 WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMET^. The omental graft is made by cutting a piece of omen- tum about an inch wide sufficiently long to encircle the intestine (Fig. 118). It is placed oyer the line of union and fixed by catgut sutures to the mesentery. ^ It adheres very rapidly to the intestine, but this adhesion maybe accelerated by lightly scarifying the peritoneal coat of the intestine to which the graft is to be applied. It is of service in preventing extravasation should a leakage occur through a stitch-wound, &c. III. PENETRATma WOUNDS WITH PROTRUSION BUT WITHOUT INJURY OF THE VISCERA. — The protruding Fig. 120.—Diagram of intestine united by Senn's plates. The arrow shows the way in which the contents of the bowel pass through the plates and incision in the wall of the bowel from the proximal into the distal portion. viscus is nearly always a portion of intestine or omentum. It should be cleansed with some weak antiseptic lotion, and returned by gentle uniform pressure into the abdo- men, care being taken not to force it between the perito- neum and fascia transversalis. If the wound of the parietes is too small to allow the viscus to be returned easily, it should be cautiously enlarged. The wound should then be closed in the way already described. If the portion of intestine is congested or inflamed, it should still be re- placed. If gangrenous, however, it should on no account be returned, but the gangrenous portion excised and the continuity of the gut restored by means of circular entero- rrhaphy or by Senn's plates, and replaced in the abdomen. In exceptional cases it may be left in situ, an incision

mjURIES OF KEGIONS. 353 SECTION Y. Injuries of Eegions. iis"juries of the head. Injuries of the Scalp, CoOTUSiONS OF THE SCALP are very common as the result of falls or blows on the head, and are frequently followed, especially in children, by extravasation of blood, and the consequent formation of a hwmatoma or blood- tumour. In new-born infants such tumours are of fre- quent occurrence in consequence of severe pressure on the head during birth, especially when instruments have been used, and are then known as cephalhcematomata. The blood may be extravasated (1) between the aponeurosis and the pericranium ; and (2) between the pericranium and the bone. In the latter situation the resulting tumour is generally circum- scribed in consequence of the pericranium being firmly attached along the lines of the sutures; in the former it is generally difose, and in some instances extends over the whole of one side of the head. The diffuse form can only be mistaken for an abscess, from which, however, it may be distinguished by its sudden formation and the absence of signs of inflamma- tion. The circumscribed, which gives rise to a soft fluctuating tumour with hard and often sharp margins, is sometimes very diflicult to diagnose from a depressed fracture. In the case of the blood-tumour the hard margins (which are due to the coagulation of the blood at the circumference—the central part remaining fluid) Fig. 95. — a.

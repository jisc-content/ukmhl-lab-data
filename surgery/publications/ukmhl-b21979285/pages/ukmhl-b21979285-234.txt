DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES. 218 SECTION lY. Diseases or Special Tissues. DISEASES OF BONE. Diseases of bone may be classified into those depending upon—1. Inflammation and its results. 2. Simple defect or increase in nutrition. 3. Constitutional dyscrasia; and 4. New growths. 1. Inflammation and its Results, Inflammation of bone.—In studying inflammation of bone it should be borne in mind that it is in the soft parts of bone,—the periosteum, the medullary membrane, and the delicate vascular connective tissue which pervades the Haversian canals and cancelli that the inflammation occurs, and that the pathological process, though some- what modified by the hard and resisting nature of the osseous framework, is essentially similar to that which occurs in the soft tissues. The same vascular and exuda- tive changes ensue, and are accompanied by the like phenomena of redness, heat, pain and swelling. The in- flammation, moreover, may be of a simple and local, or of a diffuse and septic or infective character, and variously influenced by such constitutional states as syphilis, struma, gout, and rheumatism, or by the presence of miliary tubercle. Further, it may terminate in resolu- tion, or, in sclerosis, caries, necrosis, or suppuration, con- ditions comparable to fibroid thickening, ulceration, gangrene and suppuration of soft ]3arts. On account of the intimate connection of the bone with the periosteum and medullary membrane inflammation is seldom limited to any of these structures, and when one is affected the others generally soon become also involved. According, however, as the inflammation begins in, or is chiefly con- fined to the periosteum, medulla or bone, the disease for

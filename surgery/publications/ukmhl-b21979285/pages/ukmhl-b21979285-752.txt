The causes are : 1. Nervous exhaustion from overwork or sexual excesses. 2. Dyspepsia induced by saccharine food, excess of alcohol, or vegetable diet. 4. Fhosphatic deposits occur in three forms, (a) phos- phate of lime, (&) phosphate of ammonia and magnesia, or triple phosphates, (c) the two former mixed, or the fusible phosphates, (a) Phosphate of lime forms a white cloud or Fig. 283.—Phosphates of hnie. (Bryant's Surgery.) amorphous deposit of pale granules or spheroids, two of which adhering form the so-called false dumb-bell; or a crystalline deposit of six-sided prisms collected into sheaths or bundles (Fig. 283). It may be mistaken for albumen, or when in considerable quantities for pus or mucus. The urine is always alkaline, {b) The ammonio- magnesium phosphates occur in the form of large triangular prisms with truncated extremities; as four-sided prisms ; as six-sided plates; and as foliaceous stellar prisms on adding ammonia (Fig. 284). The urine is natural in colour, neutral or alkaline, and has a foetid ammoniacal odour. Causes.—Phosphatic deposits are due to local disease or injury of the urinary organs, such as may be induced by spinal mischief, a foreign body in the bladder, &c. The mucus from the bladder decomposes

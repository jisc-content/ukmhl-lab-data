(EDEMATOUS LARYNGITIS. 615 Treatment.—The application with, the brush of a strong solution of nitrate of silver (half a drachm to the ounce, or even stronger), absolute rest of the voice, residence at a suitable spa, avoidance of all sources of irritation, and appropriate remedies if there is any specific disease. (Edematous laryngitis or oedema of the glottis.—In this form there is an effusion of serous fluid into the sub- mucous tissue of the larynx, especially that about the aryteno - epiglottidean folds (Fig. 234). But the oedema does not extend below the vocal cords, as the mucous membrane is tightly attached to them without the inter- vention of any submucous tissue. Cause.—It generally comes on suddenly, and often supervenes upon some pre- vious inflammatory condition of the larynx or neighbour- ing parts. It is of common occurrence after scalds or burns of the throat, stings of insects, or the impaction in the larynx of a foreign body; or it may occur in the course of such diseases erysipelas, fevers, and Fia. 234.—(Edematous Laryn- gitis. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) as small-pox ; or be engrafted on tubercular or syphilitic ulceration of the larynx, perichondritis, or necrosis of the cartilage. (Edema of the larynx of a passive character is also a frequent termination of Bright's disease. The symptoms in the acuter forms are most urgent, the dyspnoea is extreme, and if not relieved rapidly ends in spasm and death.. When less acute the voice is affected, inspiration is often stridulous and laboured, and swallowing is painful and difficult—symptoms which may be followed by cyanosis, coma, and death. The treatment must be energetic; an emetic should be given at the onset, and leeches, ice, or, if preferred, hot sponges, applied over the thyroid carti- lage. These means failing, the oedematous part must be scarified by the laryngeal lancet, or an O'Dwyer's tube,

176 INJURIES OF SPECIAL TISSUES. femur, wliere the nature of the injury from the presence of other signs is quite obvious, crepitus should not be sought lest an impacted fracture be rendered non-impacted and afterwards remain ununited, or the periosteum uniting the fragments be torn, and a like result ensue. The Method of Union is similar to that which occurs in the healing of a wound of the soft parts by the first intention. Blood is at first extravasated between and around the fragments (Fig. 38). Then quickly follows a simple traumatic inflammation; the periosteum and adjacent soft tissues, together with the medulla, become Fig. 88.—Diagram of the fragments a few hours after simple fracture. The periosteum is torn and ragged, and separated from the bone for a slight distance above and below the fracture. Blcod is extravasated between the fragments, in the medullary canal, and in the periosteum and other soft tissues surrounding the fracture. Fig. 39.—Diagram of the process of repair in simple fracture. A. Ensheathing callus ; b. Internal callus ; c. Permanent callus. Commencing ossification of the ensheathing callus is indicated by the darker shading at the angle between the periosteum and the bone. infiltrated with leucocytes, which have escaped from the vessels of the inflamed periosteum, medulla, and bone, and by proliferating tissue cells derived from these parts. The inflammation subsides in a few days, leaving the fragments embedded in a mass of soft, red, gelatinous material [granulation-tissue)^ derived chiefly from the leucocytes and proliferated tissue cells, but according to some observers in part from the remains of the extravasated blood that has not been absorbed.

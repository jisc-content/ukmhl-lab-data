Internally, lead and opium, gallic acid, or ergot, maybe given. Some recommend the closing of the external wound and the application of a bandage to the chest, so that the blood may collect in the pleura, press on the lung, and thus stop the bleeding. 2. H^JMOTHORAX, or haemorrhage into the pleura, may occur either with or without an external wound. It is, perhaps, most often due to a fragment of a broken rib Fig. 112.—Method of compressing a wounded intercostal artery. A. Artery, l. Sheet of lint. R. e. Ribs. w.

The signs are those of internal haemorrhage with rapidly extending dulness to percussion, absence of breathing sounds, bulging of the intercostal spaces, and increasing dyspnoea. It may be distinguished from pleurisy and pneumonia by coming on immediately after the injury and by the absence of fever. Treatment,—Similar to that for haemorrhage from a wounded lung. Should the breathing become dangerously embarrassed the blood must be drawn off with the aspirator. Should suppuration occur the chest must be opened and freely drained. 3. Pneumothorax, or air in the pleura, is generally the result of a wound of the lung by a fragment of a broken rib. It may be known by tympanitic resonance, absence of breathing sounds, or amphoric breathing, metallic tinkling, bulging of the intercostal spaces, and increasing dyspnoea. When combined with haemothorax

DISEASES OF EEGIO]S"S. 604 Adenoid vegetations in the vault of the pharynx are very common in childhood. They are produced by the hypertrophy of the adenoid tissue which is so abun- dant in this situation, and are frequently met with in connection with enlargement of the tonsils, granular pharyngitis, and nasal catarrh, and if neglected may set up catarrhal otitis and incurable deafness. The chief symptoms to which they give rise are deafness, obstruc- FiG. 227.—Author's modification of Loewenberg's forceps for removing adenoid vegetations. tion to nasal respiration, a nasal or "dead" tone of voice, and a vacant expression of countenance from the child breathing with the mouth half open. To the finger, behind the palate, they feel soft, pulpy, and velvety, " like a bag of earthworms;" whilst in the mirror they Fig. 228.—Meyer's ring-knife. appear as pink or reddish, sessile or pedunculated fringe- like masses more or less obscuring the posterior nares (Fig. 219). The treatment consists in removing them, which may be done in several ways. The softer ones may be scraped away with the nail of the finger behind the palate; those about the Eustachian tubes and side of the pharynx are best extirpated by Meyer's ring-knife (Fig. 228) introduced through the nose ; and the larger ones, which are situated on the roof and back of the pharynx, by Loewenberg's forceps (Fig. 227) passed behind the palate. The pharyngeal tonsil which is usually hypertrophied in connection with adenoid growths can be readily removed by these forceps. No after-treat- ment, beyond compelling the child to breathe through the nose by keeping the mouth closed at night with

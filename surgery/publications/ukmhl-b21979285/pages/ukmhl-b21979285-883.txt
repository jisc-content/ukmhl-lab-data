The extremities of this incision are connected by tracing out j from the sole a flap which should reach just short of the j balls of the toes, and should be longer on its inner than on I its outer side (Fig. 335, + to 2'). The dorsal ligaments are ! now divided, and the knife is passed beneath the bones and made to cut its way outwards, thus completing the Fig. 335.â€”Diagram of tlie articulations of the foot and the lines of incision in the various amputations.

The astragalus and OS calcis are, of course, left in the stump. The chief objection that has been urged against the operation is the tendency of the tendo Achillis to draw up the os calcis, and consequently so depress the anterior part of the stump that the cicatrix becomes the lowest part. If care, however, is taken to make the dorsal incision nearly 3 K 2

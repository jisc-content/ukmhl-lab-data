Eesection of the bones, however, may, in some instances, be under- taken with advantage, but each case must be judged on its merits, and the indications for resection cannot be discussed here. The astragalus may be dislocated from the tibia and fibula above and from the os calcis and scaphoid below and in front, in a forward, backward, inward, or outward direc- tion ; whilst very rarely it may be rotated on its own axis either vertically or horizontally. The forward dis- FiG. 159.—Dislocation of the foot Fig. 160.—Subastragaloid dis- backwards. (St. Bartliolo- location. (St. Bartholomew's mew's Hospital Museum.)

The backward dislocation most often occurs from a wrench when the foot is flexed. The lateral dislocations when complete are always com- pound, and nearly always associated with fracture of the malleoli. Signs,—The astragalus in the forward variety can be felt projecting under, and often threatening to pro- trude through the skin of the instep; whilst in the hach-- tvard form it gives rise to a prominence beneath the tendo Achillis, which it causes to bulge backwards, to shortening of the foot, and to a projection of the tibia in front.

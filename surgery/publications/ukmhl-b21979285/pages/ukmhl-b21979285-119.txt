It is this coagulable lymph which causes the surfaces of the wound after the first few hours to adhere, or to become glazed if the wound is kept open for some time before the edges are approximated as was formerly a Fig. 20.—Diagram representing an incised wound a few hours after the incision.

A little further from the line of incision there is the usual inflammatory phenomenon of dilated vessels with accelerated flow (Fig. 20b), thus ac- counting for the faint blush of redness and the slight swelling a>bout the edges of the wound.

DISEASES OE REGIONS. 714 readily bleed. The hsemorrliage is usually arterial, and comes from ttie small arteries in the mucous membrane. Piles, whether external or internal, are at times liable to become inflamed and slough. Bym^ptoms.—External piles, beyond causing some amount of itching and unpleasant sensation about the rectum, may give rise to no symptoms unless irritated or inflamed. They are then often a source of much distress. The pile becomes swollen and painful, the pain being reflected to the surrounding parts and increased on sitting, standing, and walking. The acute symptoms usually subside in a few days, but often leave the parts thickened and irritable, and are liable to recur from time to time. Internal piles Fig. •274.—Internal piles. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) are productive of more trouble, the chief symptoms to which they give rise being hoemorrhage, and irritation and pain consequent on their protrusion and constriction by the sphincter, or as the result of their becoming inflamed; whilst the haemorrhage, when severe, may be productive of anaemia and all its attendant constitutional symptoms. The amount of haemorrhage may vary from a few drops—a mere streaking of the motions with blood—to several ounces. When first noticed, the protrusion of the piles occurs only during def aecation ; and although they may at first go back spontaneously, they often require replacement by the finger, as otherwise they are apt to become strangu- lated by the sphincter and irritated or inflamed from the chafing of the clothes. Later the sphincter becomes dilated, and they may protrude at times other than during defsecation, and in long-standing cases the mucous mem- brane becomes permanently prolapsed, and the pile remains constantly protruded. External piles then generally form in addition to the internal, whilst the

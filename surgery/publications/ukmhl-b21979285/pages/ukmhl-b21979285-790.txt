DISEASES OF UEGlOiCS. 774 A diagnosis can only be made with certainty by ex- amining the uretbra with instruments. First take a No. 8 or 9 black bougie or catheter and if this passes easily try successively larger sizes till the obstruction is met with. If on the other hand it will not pass, try a smaller bougie till one is found that will go into the bladder. If the obstruction to the passage of the bougie is met with within six inches of the meatus, a stricture exists; but if it is further than this the case is one of enlarged prostate. Do not mistake the catching of the Fia. 299.—Bulbous stem. end of the bougie in a lacuna or at the triangular ligament, or the spasm that may be present on the first trial for a stricture. Having discovered the stricture, measure the distance from the meatus on the catheter or bougie. Next pass a bulbous stem (Fig. 299) through the stricture, and then withdraw it, noting on the stem where the bulb is Fig. 300. —Otis' urethrometer. caught in the act of withdrawal. This, when compared with the distance noted on the catheter, will indicate the length of the stricture. In the same way the existence of other strictures can be discovered. The calibre of the stricture may be measured by Otis' urethrometer (Fig. 300). The method of passing a bougie or catheter can be much better learnt by five minutes' practice than by any written instructions. Here only the general rules for passing such will be given. 1. Carefully examine the instru- ment to see that it is quite clean, perfectly smooth, not defective in any part, and, in the case of a catheter, that it is pervious, in order to avoid respectively the dangers of septic infection, laceration of the urethral mucous mem- brane, the breaking off of the end of the catheter in the

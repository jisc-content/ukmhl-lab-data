DISEASES OF REGIONS. 790 obstruct the urethra gives rise to retention, and, if not soon removed, to ulceration followed by~extravasation of urine. Treatment,—If far forward, it may often be expelled whilst straining to pass water, by holding the meatus and suddenly letting go; or gentle manipulation, aided, if necessary, by incision of the meatus, may suffice. Ex- traction by the urethral forceps should next be tried (Figs. 309 and 310), and this failing, a free incision over the stone must be made, Thus^ if impacted in the mem- FiG. 309.—Urethral forceps (Arnold's). braneous portion, it should be removed through an incision in the middle line of the perineum; if in the penile portion just in front of the scrotum, it should be pushed back if possible into the membraneous portion and removed through the perineum, as an incision in the penile portion of the urethra is apt to be followed by a Fig. 310.—Hogan's urethral forceps. fistula, and should, if possible be avoided. If compelled to incise the penile urethra the incision should be free so as to prevent laceration of the tissues in extracting the stone. The edges of the wound should then be united by suture, and a soft catheter tied in the urethra for a few days till the incision has healed. Yasculae tumours are much more frequent in the female than in the male urethra. In the female, they occur as small florid excrescences usually situated about the entrance of the urethra, often surrounding it like a ring and perhaps extending some distance up it. They give rise to increased frequency of micturition, pain during the act, and intermittent attacks of haemorrhage, thus somewhat simulating the symptoms of a calculus; but inspection will at once reveal the nature of the affection.

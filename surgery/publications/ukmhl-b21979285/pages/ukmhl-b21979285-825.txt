The spermatic arteries escape injury as they slip away with the vas, to which they are attached- Other methods consist in the subcutaneous division of the veins with the galvano-cautery wire ; excision of the veins; compression of the veins by hair-lip pins and figure-of-8 sutures; division of the veins with the elastic ligature, &c. The method described above can be recom- mended as safe, painless, efficient, easy of performance, and as necessitating the minimum amount of rest subse- quent to its performance. Tumours of the spermatic cord, though occa- sionally met with, are too rare to require any description in a work of this character. HEMATOCELE or COMMON HEMATOCELE is an effusion Fig. 315.—Hsematocele. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) of blood into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. Blood may also be effused into an encysted hydrocele of the testis, epididymis or cord, into the substance of the testicle itself, or into the tissue of the scrotum; and to such the terms heematocele of the testis, hgematocele of the cord, &c., have been applied. All of these conditions, however, are too rare to admit of any description here. Causes,—An ordinary heematocele maybe due to a blow on the testicle, or a strain in lifting heavy weights, or a like injury to a hydrocele; to puncture of the testicle or blood-vessel in tapping a hydrocele ; or to the giving way of a weakened or varicose vessel in consequence of the alteration in tension on removal of the hydrocele-fluid by tapping. At times, however, it may occur sponta- neously, and is then probably due to some atheromatous

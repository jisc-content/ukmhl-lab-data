DISLOCATIONS OF THE ELBOW. 445 cavity filled up. The long head of the biceps should be preserved as in excision of the joint. Passive movements ought to be begun as soon as the wound has healed. Treatment of compound dislocation of the shoulder.—"When the wound is small, the head of the bone uninjured, and the soft parts are neither much lacerated nor bruised, an attempt should be made to reduce the dislocation. If successful, the case may then be treated as a wound of the joint. When the head of the bone is much injured, it may be excised; whilst in severe and complicated cases, amputation at the shoulder-joint may become necessary. The treatment of dislocation with fracture is often attended with much difficulty. As a rule the fracture if possible should be set, the arm placed in splints, and an Fia. 133.—Dislocation of the radius and ulna backwards. (Cooper's Dislocations.) attempt then made to reduce the dislocation. Pailing in this, the separated head may sometimes be manipulated into its socket; otherwise, splints should be applied, and when the fracture has united, another trial made to reduce the dislocation. Dislocation of the elbow is most frequent in the young. Cause—'DiicQoi violence, or a fall on, or wrench of, the forearm or hand.— Varieties.—A. Both hones (radius and ulna) : 1, backwards; 2, inwards; 3, outwards; 4, forwards; and 5, radius forwards, and ulna backwards, B. Radius only: 1, forwards ; 2, backwards; and 3, out- wards. C. Ulna only : 1, backwards. Of these, the dis- location of both bones backwards, and of the radius forwards or backwards, are the only common forms; the others are very rare, and will receive but a passing notice. Signs.-^In the common form of hoth hones hacJcivards (Fig. 133), the radius and ulna are displaced directly backwards, so that the coronoid process of the ulna rests

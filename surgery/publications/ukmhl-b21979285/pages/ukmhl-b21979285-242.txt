226 DiSiJASES 0^' SPECIAL TISSTJES. of bone, as in inflammation of the soft tissues, several terminations may occur. Thus, resolution may take place, and the bone resume more or less its normal ap- pearance ; or the inflammatory material may undergo ossification, and the bone become hard and indurated {osteosclerosis or osteoplastic osteitis), a change comparable to that which occurs in the fibroid thickening of the soft tissues; or the rarefying process may continue until the affected portion of bone is completely destroyed by the granulation-tissue {rarefying osteitis or caries), a termina- tion similar to ulceration; or if the inflammation is more acute, the vessels in the Haversian canals may become strangulated by the pressure of the inflammatory material, and the inflamed portion of bone die {necrosis), a termi- nation of like nature to gangrene of the soft tissues; or finally, the inflammatory material may break down into pus^ {sicppuration), and an abscess be produced in a way similar to that which occurs in the soft parts. Signs and diagnosis»—The signs vary according to the intensity of the inflammation, and are similar to those of simple periostitis, and when, as is frequently the case, the osteitis is associated with inflammation of the periosteum the two can hardly be distinguished. There is deep-seated boring pain, worse at night and increased on exercise, perhaps some slight oedema, but seldom any redness unless the periosteum is involved, and then only when the bone is superficial. There is at first no swelling of the bone, though subsequently it may become per- ceptibly enlarged. The deep-seated character of the pain, its increase and long continuance after percussion of the bone, with, possibly, relief by steady pressure, and the absence of much, if of any, perceptible swelling, point to osteitis; whereas pain of a more superficial character and increased on pressure, together with an earlier appearance of swelling, indicates periostitis. From chronic abscess it is not always possible to diagnose osteitis, though in abscess the pain is generally more localized, and a slight yielding of the bone at one spot may be discovered. Treatment.—Eest, elevation of the part, a few leeches in the more acute forms, the administration of iodide of potassium and in some instances mercury, the application of small blisters from time to time in the more chronic cases, and opiates internally with opium or belladonna liniments externally to relieve pain. In obstinate cases

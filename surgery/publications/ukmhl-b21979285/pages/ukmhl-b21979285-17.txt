Inflammation is defined by Dr. Burdon Sanderson as '' the succession of changes which occurs in a living tissue when it is injured, provided that the injury is not of such a degree as at once to destroy its structure and vitality." Inflammation as thus defined may occur in any tissue of the body, and in whatever tissue or organ it occurs, whether superficial or deep, transparent or opaque, vascular or non-vascular, soft or hard, the pathological process is essentially the same. General Outline of the Process.â€”Let us first study the process as it may be observed by the naked eye, say, in a portion of inflamed skin.

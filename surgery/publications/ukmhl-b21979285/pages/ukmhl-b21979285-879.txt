In either case the subclavian artery should be compressed above the clavicle, or in some instances the axillary tied before the amputation is begun. The flap method.—A large flap consisting of integuments and deltoid muscle is usually taken from the outer aspect of the joint, either by transfixion or better by cutting from without inwards.

In cutting a flap from luithout inwards, the incision is made from a point just external to the coracoid process and I carried in a circular sweep downwards as low as the insertion of the deltoid, and then upwards to the posterior fold of the axilla just behind and below the acromion.

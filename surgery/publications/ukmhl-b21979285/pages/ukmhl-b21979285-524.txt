508 DISEASES OF REGIONS. speculum with, a gentle rotatory movement. Any epithe- lium or wax that may obstruct the view should be re- moved by means of forceps (Fig. 181), or the syringe. If the canal be unobstructed, the membrana tympani can be seen stretching across its deeper part as a delicate bluish- grey or yellowish-grey semitransparent and highly polished film. Near the upper and anterior margin is a whitish pro- minence — the processus hrevis, and running down- wards and backwards from this, to a point just below the centre of the membrane is the handle of the malleus. From the tip of the handle a cone of light extends downwards and forwards, with its base to the periphery. From the processus brevis two indistinct lines extend backwards and forwards—the anterior and posterior folds. If the Fig, 180.—Aural specula. Fig. 181.-—Aural-toothed forceps. membrane be very thin or its posterior segment much retracted, the long process of the incus can be seen, poste- rior to and parallel with, the handle of the malleus. The portion of membrane above the anterior and posterior folds is called SchrapnelVs membrane, and consists only of the dermoid and mucous layers. Whilst noting these points, carefully search the membrane for perforations, opacities, or small polypi. After thus inspecting the membrane, its mobility should be ascertained by means of 1, the pneumatic speculum, or 2, by forcing air into the tympanum through the Eustachian tube, either by 4

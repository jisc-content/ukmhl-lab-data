IKJITRTES OF VEINS—UTTPTITRE. 211 if left to nature tliere is grave danger of rupture and lisemorrhage. When the carotid or the femoral artery and the adjoining veins are the subject of the lesion, no operative treatment as a rule should be undertaken unless the lesion is recent, and the blood as well as passing into the vein is being likewise extravasted into the tissues, and threatening to break through the external wound. In such a case, should pressure applied to the main artery and over the site of the wound fail, the artery must be cut down upon and tied above and below the wound. Fig. 46.—Diagram of arterio-venous aneurysm, a. Aneurysmal varix. b. Varicose aneurysm. Unless pressure controls the haemorrhage from the vein a lateral ligature must be placed on the wound in its wall, or if the wound is too large to admit of this being done, the whole vein must be tied above and below the wound. IKJITRIES OF VEINS. RuPTTTRE or subcutaneous laceration of a vein occa- sionally occurs from causes similar to those producing rupture of an artery, an accident moreover with which it is frequently associated. When the vein is of large size much blood may be extravasated into the tissues and may produce gangrene by pressure on the vessels carrying on the collateral circulation, though such a result is much less common than after rupture of an artery. The blood.

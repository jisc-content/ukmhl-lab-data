The line of flap is also shown dotted. the knife. An iridectomy upwards is now performed if required (see p. 537). Fixing the eye, pass a cystitome (Fig. 192) through the wound and divide the anterior capsule of the lens by horizontal incisions. Draw the eye now slightly downwards, and apply moderate pressure by a curette (Fig. 190) or spoon below the lower edge of the cornea till the upper edge of the lens presents in the wound (see Fig. 192) and the lens is gradually delivered. The speculum is now removed and the lids closed for a brief time, after which any soft matter is extracted by pressure applied to the surface of the cornea with a curette. The iris is now carefully replaced by the curette, and both eyes bandaged up. The after-treatment consists in keep- Fig. 192.—Cystitome.

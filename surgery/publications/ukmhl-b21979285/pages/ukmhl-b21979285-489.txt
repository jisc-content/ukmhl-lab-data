473 DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP. condyle. It must be further remembered that by rotation is meant the rolling of the femur on its own axis; that in outward rotation the anterior surface of the patella is rolled outwards, and in inward rotation inwards ; that by circumduction is meant the revolving of the femur round the axis of its head, and that in this movement the anterior surface of the patella always looks to the front. During the manipulation the patient should be placed upon his back on the floor, while the Surgeon with one hand Fig. 153.—Method of reducing Fia. 154.—Method of reducing should grasp the ankle, and with the other the femur or leg, and put the limb through the several movements required for the kind of dislocation. An assistant, if. necessary, should fix the pelvis. For the dislocation on the dorsum ilii and into the sciatic notch the movements are practically the same (Fig. 153). The limb should be flexed and slightly adducted to disengage the head from behind the acetabulum and then abducted, rotated outwards and brought down parallel to the sound limb. These movements are tersely described by Bigelow in the words * lif t up,' 'bend out,' 'roll out,' i.e., lift up or the dorsal and sciatic disloca- tions of the hip by manipula- tion. the pubic and thyroid dislo- cations of the hip by mani- pulation.

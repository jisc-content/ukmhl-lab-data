If there is any doubt whether the tumour is an I adeno-fibroma or a sarcoma it is better to have the con- I sent of the patient before the operation for the removal j ' of the whole breast should the tumour when cut into I appear to have malignant characters, i Cysto-SARCOMATA, adeno-cystomata, sero-cystic sarco- niata, and glandular proliferating cysts, are terms applied to tumours in the breast in which the growth in the peri- j acinous connective tissue projects^ into the interior of I dilated acini and ducts in the form of papillary or cauli- [ flower-like masses. The periacinous growth, which may consist of fibrous tissue, spindle or round cells, or of I Fig. 322.—Cystic adenoma of the breast, j (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) a mixture of all these, protrudes the wall of the dilated acinus or duct in front of it, but does not penetrate the epithelial lining, and may ultimately fill the whole acinus, which is thus converted into a mere slit-like space lined i with epithelium. On section the tumour may present one or more larger cysts, containing variously-shaped cauliflower-like growths sprouting from their walls. Or it may appear completely solid from the cysts having been entirely filled with intra-cystic growths; on dis- section, however, the spaces between the growths and the cyst-walls can always be demonstrated. When the growth, which is at first encapsuled, attains some size, the skin may give way and the growth protrude in the form of a fungus. The skin, however, does not become infiltrated as in carcinoma. Signs.—They generally occur in women between the ages of thirty and thirty-five, as distinctly defined, lobu-

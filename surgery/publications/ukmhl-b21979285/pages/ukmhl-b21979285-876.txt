It is frequently connected with an enlarged bunion (see Bunion) over the inner side of the joint. In the way of treatment a sock with a separate stall for the big toe should be worn and the boots should be straight along the inner edge and square at the toes. Krohne's lever or Bigg's bunion spring- will be found useful in correcting the inward displacement; for advanced cases, excision of the head of the metatarsal bone is attended with the best results. Hammer toe is a condition in which usually the second toe is hyperextended at the metatarso-phalangeal joint and flexed at the first interphalangeal joint. Wrenching the toe, dividing the ligaments subcutaneously, excising the joint, or amputating the toe according to the degree of the deformity, is the proper treatment.

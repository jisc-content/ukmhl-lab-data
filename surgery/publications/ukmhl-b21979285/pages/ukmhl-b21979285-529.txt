Impaction of cerumen may be caused by narrowing of the meatus, cleaning the ears with the end of a towel or ear-pick, or the presence of a foreign body, such as a piece of cotton-wool inserted into the meatus and forgotten. The chief symptom is partial or complete deafness, generally coming on suddenly. There may be tinnitus or even giddiness, often persistent cough, rarely pain. Sometimes the impaction of cerumen is really due to a peculiar laminated desquamation of the skin of the meatus, which becomes mixed with wax, and thus forms a plug. Treatment,-—H the wax be not very hard it can be at once removed by syringing with warm water, the auricle being pulled backwards and upwards, and the nozzle of the syringe directed along the upper and posterior wall. If any difficulty be experienced in re- moving the wax owing to its hardness, soften it first by dropping into the ear for a few nights a warm solution of bicarbonate of soda (gr. x. ad f^j.)* After removal, gently dry the meatus with a cone of absorbent wool, and let the patient keep a piece in the meatus for a few hours. Otomycosis is a chronic inflammation of the external auditory meatus due to the presence of a vegetable fungus. The symptoms are a sense of fulness, tinnitus and occa- sional vertigo, more or less itching and occasionally pain. On examination there is seen a slight serous discharge, and the meatus contains yellowish or blackish flakes, on removal of which the skin beneath is found to be reddened and occasionally bleeding.

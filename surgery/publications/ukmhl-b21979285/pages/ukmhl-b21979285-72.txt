It is charac- terized by the appearance, after a certain period of incu- bation during which the poison is circulating in the system, of a local lesion at the seat of inoculation, fol- lowed by induration of the nearest lymphatic glands, and after a variable time by certain affections of the skin and mucous membranes and more rarely of the deeper tissues, and still later by fibroid changes in the tissues and viscera, or the formation of gummata which are exceed- ingly liable to break down and suppurate. General outline of the disease.â€”Beyond perhaps a slight abrasion, which heals in a few days, and is possibly thought no more of, nothing is probably noticed till about three weeks to a month. Attention is then called to the part by a slight irritation, and a red papule may be noticed which slowly enlarges, becomes indurated at the base, and perhaps ulcerates. This papule or ulcer is

TUMOURS—SARCOMATA. 83 instances, appear to have no definite arrangement. Spindle-celled sarcomata are subdivided according to the size of their cells into the large-spindle-celled and small- spindle-celled varieties. The small-spindle-celled sarcomata are firmer and less rapid in their growth than the round-celled or large- spindle-celled forms; they do not become so quickly disseminated in internal organs, and are therefore less malignant. They generally recur locally when removed; but after many recurrences, their tendency to return may at length cease, or they may, on the other hand, assume a more malignant form and become disseminated. Structure.—They consist of small spindle cells containing usually a single nucleus; the cells are embedded in a small amount of homogeneous intercellular substance, which at times is somewhat fibrillated. They may at first be enclosed by a capsule, but later infiltrate the sur- rounding parts. They appear as smooth firmish growths, pinkish-white, semi-translucent, and fibrillated on section. Their microscopical appearance is seen in Fig. 13. Secondary changes,—Eibrification, chondrification, calci- fication, ossification, and, when implicating the skin, ulceration. ^ Usual seats.—Periosteum, fascise, and sub- cutaneous tissue. The large-spindle-celled sarcomata are much softer than the preceding variety, and often grow rapidly, and quickly become disseminated; indeed, they may be as malignant as the round-celled growths. Structure.— They consist of large spindle cells, which frequently contain several oval nuclei, embedded in a scanty amount of intercellular substance. They occur as non-encapsuled tumours of soft consistency, frequently in parts diffluent, and on section appear of a pinkish-white colour, and often blotched with blood.

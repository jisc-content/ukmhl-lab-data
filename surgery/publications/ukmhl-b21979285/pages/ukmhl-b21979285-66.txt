50 GENERAL PATHOLOGY OF SURGICAL DISEASES. leucocytes, scattered through a delicate reticulum of branched connective-tissue cells, which is sometimes continuous with the processes of the giant-cells. There is no distinct line of demarcation between the outer zone of lymphoid cells and the surrounding tissues. The tubercle-nodule, though sometimes seated upon a small vessel, is itself completely non-vascular. The bacilli may be found in the giant-cells especially in animals, and in and amongst the endothelial cells. They are less readily discovered after caseation has commenced. They are rod-like bodies usually straight, sometimes curved, rounded at the ends, and about one-fifth their length in breadth. Although the above may be regarded as the typical microscopical appearance of a miliary tubercle, often neither giant-cells nor endothelioid cells are present, whilst both these may be found in chronic inflammations which are not tubercular. Development of tubercle. â€” A tubercle nodule appears generally to arise from an endothelium such as is fouud in serous cavities or the walls of the blood-vessels or lymphatics. It is supposed that the bacilli are arrested at some spot in the affected organ whilst being carried through it in the blood stream, or else come into contact

COMPLICATIONS OF rHACTURE. 189 involves tlie lower extremity, especially the femur; but each, case must be judged on its own merits, and some surgeons will attempt to save what others condemn. Every legitimate effort should of course be made to save a limb, but we must remember that in attempting to do so we may place the patient's life in danger; and that too often it is a question of a limb versus the life. If amputation is not performed at once or within the first twenty-four hours, and it then becomes evident that the limb must be sacrificed, the amputation should not as a rule be undertaken till the traumatic fever has subsided, the surgeon watching carefully for the most favourable opportunity that presents itself. The signs calling for amputation during the suppurating stage are:—Exten- sive suppuration, great sloughing of the soft tissues, inflammation and ■ suppuration of a neighbouring joint, necrosis of large portions of bone, exhaustion, hectic, and lardaceous disease. Complications of fractiiee.—A simple fracture may be complicated by any of the general affections attending other injuries, as shock, traumatic delirium, tetanus, retention of urine; and by such local conditions as, 1, concomitant dislocation, 2, extravasation of blood, 3, rupture of the main artery, vein, or nerve, 4, implication of a joint, 5, gangrene from tight bandaging, 6, paralysis from the use of a crutch, or the implication of a nerve in the callus, 7, venous thrombosis, 8, embolism, 9, forma- tion of ulcers or bed-sores over prominences of bone, 10, erysipelas, 11, fat-embolism, and 12, suppuration where there is much laceration of the tissues with giving way of the skin, the fracture then becoming compound. A compound fracture may in consequence of the open wound be complicated, in addition to the above-mentioned affections, septic inflammation and suppuration, necrosis, saprcemia, septicaemia, pycemia and hectic. Of these complications of fracture, whether simple or compound, the only ones that need be further mentioned here are the following :— Fracture combined with dislocation.—In simple fracture the treatment consists in placing where possible the frac- ture in splints, and then attempting the reduction of the dislocation. Where the dislocated end cannot be replaced the fragments must be allowed to consolidate, and another attempt then made to reduce the dislocation ; or the sur- geon may try to manipulate the dislocated portion into its

SCOLIOSIS, OR LATERAL CURYATXJRE. 637 a permanent lateral curve. Whilst, however, a curve is thus being produced, say, in the dorsal region with its convexity to the right, a compensating curve in order to maintain the equilibrium of the spine is being simul- taneously produced in the lumbar region with its con- vexity to the left (Fig. 243). Coincidently with these changes a rotary movement of the affected vertebrae upon Fia. 243.â€”Lateral curvature of the spine. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) their vertical axes is taking place, so that while the bodies turn towards the convexity of the curve the apices of the spinous processes turn towards the concavity. Hence, in addition to the formation of the primary and the secondary or compensating curves, we have a twisting round of the spine within these curves, as a consequence of which the ribs on the convex side are carried backwards with the transverse processes, causing the an^ele of the scapula on that side to project; whilst the ribs on the concave side are for the same reason carried forwards, producing a prominence of the corresponding breast

The latter condition is more common in fractures near the articular ends of bone where rotatory as well as angular movement may occur; the former in the shaft where angular movement only is permitted. The Causes are local and constitutional. The local are —1, The fragments not having been kept thoroughly at Fig. 41.—False joint following fracture of the humerus. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) rest; 2, The fragments not having been placed in apposi- tion in consequence of {a) muscular contraction; (h) the loss of a large piece of bone, as in compound fracture; (c) the intervention of a piece of muscle, tendon, or peri- osteum between the fragments; and {d) the effusion of synovial fluid in the case of a fracture into a joint; 3, The necrosis of the end of one of the fragments; 4, The interference with the arterial supply of one of the fragments, as from injury of the medullary artery; and 5, The poor supply of blood to one of the fragments, as in fracture of the anatomical neck of the humerus.

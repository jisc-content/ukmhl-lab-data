383 DISLOCATION OF THE LOWER JAW. tion is said to be complete; wlien only one is displaced, incomplete. Nature of displacement,—The condyle with the interarticular cartilage is drawn over the eminentia articularis into the zygomatic fossa, where it is firmly held by the contraction of the internal pterygoid, masseter. and temporal muscles. Signs.—The mouth is widely open and cannot be closed by any voluntary effort of the patient, and the saliva constantly dribbles away. In complete dislocation the symphysis remains in the middle line, and an unnatural hollow is felt behind each condyle. If the dislocation is partial the symphysis is carried over to the opposite side, and the hollow is felt only behind Fig. 105.—Mechanism of reduction of a dislocated jaw. f. Cork acting as fulcrum. The dotted lines represent the masseter and temporal muscles—the weight to be overcome by the hand or power. Fia. 106.—The four-tailed bandage applied. (Bryant's Surgery.) the dislocated condyle. Treatment.—The indications are to overcome the contracted muscles, and so allow the displaced condyle or condyles to be drawn by the temporal and deep fibres of the masseter, the retractors of the jaw, over the eminentia articularis into their sockets. A cork, or the thumbs, wrapped in a towel to avoid being bitten, should be placed between the last molar teeth of the upper and lower jaw on each side to act as a fulcrum whilst pressure is made in an upward direction on the symphysis by the Surgeon's hands on the principle of a lever of the first order (Fig. 105). Whilst the symphysis is thus pushed upwards the condyle is drawn downwards, the weight, represented by the contracted muscles, being

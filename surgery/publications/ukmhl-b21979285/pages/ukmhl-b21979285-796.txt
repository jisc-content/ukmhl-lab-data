DISEASES OF BEGIONS. 780 preference to the latter. The cases suitable for it are : 1. Intractable strictures that cannot be dilated beyond the^ size of a No. 5 or 6 catheter. 2. Strictures which rapidly recontract after dilating instruments are dis- continued. 3. Cases in which the passage of instruments is constantly followed by retention of urine, heematuria, rigors, urethral fever, or other constitutional symptoms. It is especially applicable to strictures within three or four inches of the meatus. Anaesthesia of the urethra should be induced by injection with a 20 per cent, solution of cocaine. The operation may be done by cutting—1. From before backwards; and 2. Erom c Fm. 301.—Teevan's urethrotome. A, staff; b, b, stylets ; c, olivary bougie ; t>, knife ; e, knife-sheath. behind forwards. The latter method requires that the stricture should be dilated up to the size of a No. 4 or 5 catheter to enable the sheathed blade of the instrument to be passed through it; the former can be done if the stricture will admit a No. 2 catheter. There are many ways of performing both methods. The following appear to be the best:— 1. Internal division of the stricture from hefore hack- luards.—If the stricture is sufficiently near the meatus it may be simply divided by a straight blunt-pointed bistoury; otherwise Teevan's urethrotome, which is a modification of Maisonneuve's, should be used (Fig. 301). It consists of a slender staff A with an open slot running along it to within two inches of its end. Within this staff is fitted a stylet B. The slender olivary bougie c is first wriggled through the stricture into the bladder; the staff A is then screwed on to the bougie and made to follow it, the bougie coiling up in the bladder. When the stylet is withdrawn the urine will escape if the in-

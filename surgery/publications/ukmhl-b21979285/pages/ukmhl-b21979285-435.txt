WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEK. 419 both, the proximal and distal portions about five inches above and below the divided spot by passing a piece of indiarubber tubing through a small incision in the mesentery and tying it sufficiently tightly to prevent any further faecal soiling of the parts. Invaginate the divided ends with the peritoneal surfaces in contact and unite them by a continuous suture passed through the peri- toneal and muscular coats (Fig. 119, A a). Make an incision about an inch in length along the convexity of each portion of the intestine between the sutured end and Fio,. 117. Fig. 118. Fig. 117.—A Senn's decalcified bone-plate threaded ready for use. A fine cliina silk suture with a loop at one end, the size of the aperture in the plate, is passed through one of the suture holes, and to this loop the three other sutures passed through the three remaining holes are securely tied. The plates should be kept in alcohol. Fig. 118.—Portion of intestine with line of suture covered by omental graft. i. Intestine. m. Mesentery. o. (xraft. s. Suture fixing graft. the rubber clamp. Insert into each incision a Senn's bone plate properly threaded, as shown in Fig. 117, with four fine aseptic china silk sutures. Pass the lateral sutures from within outwards through all the coats of the intestine a line or two from the margin of the incision and bring the longitudinal sutures out through each end of the incision (Fig. 119).

Should the existence of an abscess be suspected the bone may be drilled in several directions or a small trephine applied. Where there is a taint of gout, struma or rheumatism, appro- priate remedies for these affections must, of course, be given.

Cause, — Tubercle and syphilis are undoubtedly the most frequent causes of caries. Sometimes, however, caries would appear to depend on a debilitated state of the system, in which there is no evidence of tubercle or syphilis, and to which the term struma may with propriety be applied. Occasionally it is the result of an injury. Pathology,— Caries, as has already been stated, is one of the terminations of osteitis; indeed, it is often some- what difficult to say where osteitis ends and caries begins. Q 2

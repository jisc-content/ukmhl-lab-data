Let the bulb expand and the outward current will bring away some of the fragments and debris which will fall into the receiver and be prevented from returning into the bladder by the trap (see Fig. 291) on again compressing the bulb. Continue compressing and relaxing till fragments cease to come away. Then if any are felt by the evacuating catheter, reintroduce the lithotrite, or a smaller one, and crush again and aspirate as before, repeating this till all the fragments are removed. The operation frequently lasts for an hour to an hour and a half or longer. Fig. 291.—Thompson's improved evacuator and trap. After-treatment.—Opium, if no serious kidney disease is present, may be given; and hot hip-baths if there is much pain. If there is retention the catheter should be used at regular times, or tied in if its passage causes much irritation and pain. Complete rest for a few days or longer should be enjoined. If cystitis follows the opera- tion. Sir Henry Thompson strongly recommends a weak injection of silver nitrate (gr. i. to f^i-)- As a rule, however, I have found no after-treatment required, even in young boys. Indeed in several cases the child has been up and playing about the ward the day after the operation. After'Comj)licaUons.—1, Eigors and fever, 2, retention . of urine, 3, acute cystitis, 4, prostatitis and abscess, and 5, orchitis and epididymitis, occasionally occur. More rarely, 6, haemorrhage, 7, suppression of urine, and 8, phlebitis of the prostatic plexus of veins, followed by pyaemia. The impaction of a fragment of the calculus in the urethra (formerly common when the fragments were left in the bladder), cannot occur if the bladder has been thoroughly evacuated. w. 3 c

MALIGNANT DISEASE OF THE TESTICLE. 8l7 Treatment,—The earlier the testicle is affected in the course of constitutional syphilis the more marked will be the effect of mercury; the later, of iodide of potassium. Often the best results are obtained from the two drugs combined. Locally, the testicle may be merely suspended; or it may be strapped in the earlier stages with advantage. Any fluid in the tunica vaginalis will commonly be ab- sorbed during the treatment, though sometimes tapping may be required. Should the skin give way, and an ulcer be produced, it should be treated like other syphi- litic ulcers. In rare instances, where the testicle is totally disorganized, extirpation may become necessary. Fig. 318.—Enchondroma»of the testicle. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) Enchondromata OB, CARTILAGINOUS tumours of the testicle are very rare. A beautiful example, however, is shown in the accompanying illustration (Fig. 318). They j may be known by their extreme hardness. Eemoval of I the testicle is the proper treatment. I Malignant disease of the testicle generally occurs I in the form of round-celled sarcoma, more rarely in the i form of soft carcinoma; but, without a microscopical exa- mination, the two diseases, even on section, are often quite indistinguishable. Sarcoma begins in the inter tubular connective tissue, and most frequently occurs in early life; carcinoma in the tubules, as a proliferation of the epithelial lining, and is most common after the period of middle age. In both, the body of the organ is pri- w. 3 a

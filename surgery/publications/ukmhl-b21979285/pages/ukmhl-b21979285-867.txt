The acquired form is generally the result of infantile para- lysis, the bones being then drawn into their abnormal posi- tions by the contraction of the muscles antagonistic to those paralysed, the weight of the body in standing and walk- ing tending more and more to confirm this faulty position. Amongst other causes may be mentioned long-continu- ance of the foot in the extended position, disease of the ankle or tarsus, yielding of the ligaments, &c. Varieties.—There are five principal forms of club-foot:— Talipes equinm, varus, calcaneus, valgus and cavus. But these may be variously combined, producing compound CongenitacL AcquirC'd- Fig. 326.—Talipes equiniis.

In talipes equinus (Fig. 326), which is nearly always an acquired affection, and generally due to infantile para- lysis, the heel is drawn upwards by the tendo Achillis, and the anterior part of the foot is in consequence de- pressed and held in the extended position. The weight of the body is thus transmitted through the heads of the metatarsal bones, which together with the anterior part of the tarsus are bent downwards and backwards from the transverse tarsal joint and fixed in this position by the adaptive shortening of the plantar fascia, ligaments and muscles thus rendering the sole of the foot unnaturally concave, a condition known as pes cavus. The patient walks with fatigue and lameness on the balls of his toes, and if both feet are affected he may be unable to walk at all. In long-standing cases, in consequence of the con- 3 I 2

TUMOURS —P APILLOMAT A. 87 atrophy. As age advances, the epithelmm in the case of the warty growths is liable to invade the underlying connective tissue, the papilloma being thus converted into an epithelioma. The' signs^ diagnosis, and treatment of the different varieties of papillomata are given under the head of skin, syphilis, bladder, rectum, and larynx. All that need be said here is that warty growths, especially in some situations as about the genitals, may greatly resemble epithelioma, from which, however, they may generally be distinguished by the absence of induration at their base, Fig. 15.—Adenomatous Tumour. slower growth, non-implication of the glands, the probable history of venereal disease, and by their occurrence usually at an age younger than that at which epithelioma is commonly met with. Adenomata or glandular tumours are innocent growths resembling secreting glands in structure, and only grow in connection with pre-existing glandular tissue. They are divided into the acinous and tubular, according as they resemble one or other of these glands. The acinous variety consists of acini, lined with spheroidal epithelium, and communicating with each other by duct- like channels. The acini are clustered in twos, threes, or more, and are separated and bound together by connective tissue, in which the vessels ramify. Pure adenomata are rare, the scanty amount of intertubular and interacinous connective tissue in such being more often replaced by fibrous tissue (adeno-fihroma), or by mucous tissue {adeno-

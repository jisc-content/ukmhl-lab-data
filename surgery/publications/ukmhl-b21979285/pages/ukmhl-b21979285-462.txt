446 INJURIES OF EEGIONS. in the olecranon fossa, and tlie neck of the radius on tlie capitellum of the humerus. The coronoid process is often fractured at the same time. The bones are frequently displaced slightly outwards, or inwards, as well as back- wards — modifications which have been unnecessarily classed as distinct varieties. The forearm is partially flexed and shortened. The olecranon and head of the radius form an unnatural prominence posteriorly, and are felt at a considerable distance behind the external and internal condyles respectively. The lower end of the humerus forms a broad projection heloiu the crease of the bend of the elbow. In the rarer forms of hoth hones inwards or outiua/rds the prominence of the opposite condyle of the humerus on one or other side is a charac- teristic feature. In hoth hones forwards (exceedingly rare) the forearm is lengthened, the natural prominence of the olecranon is lost, and the condyles of the humerus are very prominent. In the ulna hackioards and the radius forwards the arm is greatly increased in its antero- posterior diameter. In dislocation of the radius alone, lohether forwards, hack- wards, or outwards, the head of the bone is felt to roll in its abnormal situation, in front of, behind, or external to, the external condyle on pronating and supinating the hand. The first of these forms (Fig. 134) is the most common, and in it the forearm cannot be flexed beyond a right angle, in consequence of the head of the bone striking the humerus.

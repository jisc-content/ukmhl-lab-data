INJURIES OF REGIONS. 420 intestine corresponding to tlie situation of the bone-plates opposite to each other, and having scarified the serous surfaces lightly with the point of a needle to aid subse- quent adhesion, tie each of the four sutures coming from one bone-plate to the corresponding suture from the other, just sufficiently tightly to keep the wall of the intestine between the plates in contact. Tuck in the knots between the approximated serous surfaces and apply round the line of approximation for greater safety an omental graft (Fig. 118). On removing the clamps the contents flow as shown by the arrow in Eig. 120, through the central hole Fig. 119.â€”Method of forming an intestinal anastomosis by Senn's bone-plates after complete division of the bowel. The divided ends closed by continuous suture, a. a. in the bone-plates and the incision in the walls of the gut from the proximal to the distal portion of intestine. The bone-plates hold the portions of intestine in contact, preventing any leakage of faeces till firm union has occurred. They ultimately become dissolved, and, to- gether with the sutures, are passed per anum. The advantages of this method over circular enterorrhaphy as practised by the Lembert and Czerny-Lembert suture are that it can be done in a much shorter time (a quarter of an hour ?) and hence greatly minimizes the risk from shock. It also appears attended with less danger of septic peritonitis, in consequence of leakage between the sutures or one of the Lembert stitches having penetrated the mucous coat.

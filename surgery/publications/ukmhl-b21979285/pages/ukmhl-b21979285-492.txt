476 INJURTES OF REGIONS. by a padded leather band, counter-extension being made simultaneously and in the same straight line as the exten- sion, by fixing the pelvis by means of a perineal band, secured by suitable straps to a staple in the wall or floor. The patient should be placed on a low couch or on a mat- tress on the floor. The line of extension and counter- extension differs accord- ing to the form of dis- location. Thus:—In the dorsal (Fig. 155), ex- tension should be made across the lower third of the sound thigh, the pulleys being fixed to a staple in the wall a few feet from the foot of the couch above the level of the body, and the counter - extending band to a staple in the floor near the head of the couch. In the sciatic (Fig. 156), the extension is made in a nearly similar direction, save that the thigh should be more flexed. In the thyroid (Fig. 157), extension is made in an upward and out- ward direction, by means of a perineal band passed round the upper part of the dislocated thigh and attached to pulleys fixed to a staple in the wall on the injured side. Counter-extension is made by a band passed round the pelvis and secured to a staple in the floor on the sound side. The ankle, in the mean- time, is drawn towards the mesial line of the body by the Surgeon's hand passed behind the sound limb. The line of extension and counter-extension here runs obliquely across the body. In the jpubic (Fig. 158), extension is maae downwards and outwards by Fia. 157. — Eeduction of thyroid dislocation by pulleys. (Cooper's Dislocations.)

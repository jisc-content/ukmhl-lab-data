Talipes calcaneus is rare. In the congenital variety (Fig. 329) the anterior part of the foot is drawn up and often a little everted, and generally held rigidly in this position by the contraction of the extensor muscles. In the acquired form (Fig. 329), which is commonly the result of infantile paralysis of the calf muscles, the heel is placed first on the ground in walking, but there is no drawing up of the foot by the extensors. The anterior part of the foot drops downwards from the transverse tarsal joint, and the tendo Achillis, instead of standing out j tensely, can often hardly be felt.

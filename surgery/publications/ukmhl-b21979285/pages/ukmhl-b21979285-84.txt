68 GENERAL PATHOLOGY OE SURGICAL DISEASES. consequence (Fig. 7). The child should be well and carefully fed during the mercurial course, and small doses of cod-liver oil may often be taken with advantage. If the mother is unable to suckle the infant it must be brought up by hand, not by a wet nurse, for fear of her nipple becoming affected with a primary chancre, a danger the mother herself does not run, even although she has exhibited no signs of syphilis. This inability of an infant with inherited syphilis to infect its mother (known as Cones' laiv) was formerly thought to be a proof that the mother had suffered from syphilis whilst the foetus was in utero. In some instances this has no doubt been the case. But in other instances she has shown no sign of syphilis during gestation, and there has been reliable evidence that she had not had the disease pre- viously. The explanation offered by the followers of M. Pasteur is that the syphilis of the foetus has protected the mother. In the later stages of congenital syphilis, as in those of the acquired form, iodide of potassium is indicated, and may frequently be advantageously combined with small doses of mercury, where the later lesions, as is too often the case, prove intractable. Lastly, should syphilis be suspected in either of the parents during the period of gestation, mercury should be administered to the mother; whilst a caution should be given to both parents after the birth of a syphilitic infant for the sake of any future o:ff- spring.

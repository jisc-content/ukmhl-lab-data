DISEASES OE REGIONS. 80i testicle is situated behind and near its lower part, save in exceptional cases, where adhesions have been con- tracted to the anterior wall, or the testicle has descended retroyerted. The treatment may be palliative or radical. Palliative treatment consists in tapping the hydrocele with a trocar and cannula, and repeating the operation from time to time as required. Before tapping a hydrocele the situation of the testicle should be made out, lest it be injured by the trocar. This can usually be done by marking the opaque spot whilst examining for translucency, and by the patient's sensation on handling it. If the sac is not very Fig. 313.â€”Tapping a hydrocele. (Bryant's Surgery.) tense the testicle can be felt. Choose a spot for puncture near the bottom of the swelling, free from scrotal veins which can readily be seen through the skin, and having made out the situation of the testicle, grasp the tumour from behind with the palm of the hand so as to make it tense, and plunge the trocar and cannula,- held as in Eig. 313, sharply into the sac to ensure perforating the wall. The trocar should be directed at first backwards, and then immediately turned upwards to avoid wounding the testicle. Having withdrawn the fluid, remove the cannula, and apply a small pad of lint or strapping. The radical cure is commonly effected by injecting tincture of iodine into the sac through the cannula after having withdrawn the fluid. The quantity injected is usually about two drachms. If ten drops of a 5% solu- tion of cocaine are injected before the iodine no pain generally is felt. The iodine sets up some slight amount of inflammation, and generally cures by restoring the

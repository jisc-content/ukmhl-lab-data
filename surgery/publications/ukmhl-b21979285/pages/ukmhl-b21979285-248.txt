232 DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES. superficial situations, as in the cranial bones (Fig. 53), where its process can be watched. Here, say, from the breaking down of a syphilitic node {syphilitic periostitis), a portion of bone is exposed and dies. This acting as an irritant causes the bone around to beconie inflanaed (Fig. 52); rarefaction {ulceration) ensues, and around the dead portion is formed a groove, which gradually deepens and extends beneath the dead part until the latter is completely cut off from the living, and if not removed by art simply comes away, or exfoliates as it is technically Fig. 54. Figs. 54, 55, and 56 illustrate the formation of a sequestrum, its separation from the living bone, and the cavity left after its removal, a. Dead bone ; b. Living bone ; c. The separated periosteum lined by granulations ; d. Cloacae lined by granula- tions, which are indicated by shading, and are continuous with those lining the cavity containing the sequestrum ; e. New peri- osteal bone perforated by cloacae. /, Cavity left after removal of the dead bone. (After Billroth.) termed. The cavity left becomes filled with granulations, which subsequently ossify, and so restore the lost part. In situations, as in the tibia (Fig. 54), where the perios- teum has not been destroyed, ossification of this membrane proceeds at the same time as the bone is being separated. The dead bone thus becomes surrounded on all sides by new bone, and lies bathed in pus in a cavity lined ^ith

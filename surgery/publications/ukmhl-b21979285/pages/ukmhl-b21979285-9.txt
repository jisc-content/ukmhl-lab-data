PEEFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION. The book, although not quite two years have elapsed since the publication of the third edition, has again been thoroughly revised and brought up to date. Twenty-four pages and eighteen new illustrations have been added to the present edition. The chief alterations will be found in the sections on Abdominal and Brain Surgery, but much new matter has been introduced throughout. The sections on the Ear and Eye have been revised by their authors Mr. Cumberbatch and Mr. Jessop, respectively. I am again indebted to Mr. W. G. Spencer, Assist- ant-Surgeon to the Westminster Hospital, for advice and help ; also to my friends Mr. John Miller, M.R.C.S., andMr.Masterman, F.R.C.S., House Surgeon to St. Bar- tholomew's Hospital, for many valuable notes and suggestions, and to the latter in addition for his kindness in reading the proof-sheets.

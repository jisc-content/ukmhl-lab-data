325 LIGATURE OF ARTEEIES. extremity. its fibres running downwards and inwards. Draw the muscle to the inner side, and the aponeurotic covering of Hunter's canal (known by its strong transverse fibres) will be seen. Divide it on a director, and the artery will be found lying between the vastus internus on the outer side and the adductor longus and magnus on the inner side. The vein is behind and a little external to the artery. The long saphenous nerve crosses the artery from the outer to the inner side. Pass the aneurysm needle from without inwards, keep- ing the point well applied to the vessel, as the vein in this situation is usually very adherent to the artery. The chief dangers after ligature are : — 1. gangrene ; 2, secondary haemorrhage; 3, phle- bitis and pyaemia from pricking the vein (see p. 306).' The collateral circulation (Fig. 91) is carried on by the anastomosis of (a) the per- forating branches of the profunda with the articular branches of the popliteal; (b) the descending branch of the external circumflex with the external articular branches of the popliteal and tibial recurrent; and (c) the artery of the great sciatic nerve with the internal articular branches of the popliteal. The popliteal artery may be ligatured in its upper part for popli- teal aneurysm. Place the limb on its outer side and make an incision about four inches long at the upper part of the popliteal space over the centre of the artery. Divide the deep fascia and feel for the pulsation of the vessel at the inner margin of the semi-membranosus. Hook the nerve outwards or in- wards, and open the sheath well to its inner side to avoid the vein. The posterior tibial artery.—In the upper third.

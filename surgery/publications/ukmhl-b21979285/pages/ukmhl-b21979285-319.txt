HUOTEEIAN LIGATUEE IN ANEURYSM. 303 therefore applied his ligature at a distance from the aneurysm, where he had observed moreover that the artery was likely to be in a healthier condition. For aneurysms so situated that a ligature cannot be placed on the cardiac side, Brasdor proposed tying the trunk of the artery on the distal side of the aneurysm; whilst Wardrop suggested tying one or two of the terminal branches of the artery on the distal side of the aneurysm where neither Brasdor's operation nor the proximal ligature was applicable. Hence ligature for aneurysm may be applied (Fig. 86), 1. On the peoximal side of the aneurysm either at a distance [Hunter''s method) or immediately above it [AneVs Fig. 86.—Different positions of ligature for Aneurysm. A, Antyllus's method ; b. Anel's ; c. Hunter's ; d. Brasdor's ; and E. Wardrop's. method). 2. On THE DISTAL SIDE of the aneurysm, either to the main trunk {Brasdor^s method), or to one or more of the main branches [Wardrop's method). 3. Immediately above and below the aneurysm, either opening the sac [the old operation), or without opening the sac [Antyllus's method). 1. The peoximal ligatuee. A. Huntee's method.— This operation, when applicable, is the one now almost universally adopted. The chief merits claimed for it are—1. That the artery at the spot selected for ligature is not only more likely to be healthy, but is also more easily tied than the artery in close proximity to the sac, in which latter situation, moreover, its anatomical rela- tions are liable to be disturbed by the aneurysm. 2. That the sac is not interfered with, and hence is less likely to

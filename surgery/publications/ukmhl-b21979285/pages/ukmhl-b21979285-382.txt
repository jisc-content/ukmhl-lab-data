INJURIES OF REGIONS. 366 brain, the patient lies in a completely unconscious state, and cannot be roused either by shouting in his ear or by shaking him. The extremities on one or both sides are paralysed; the face is livid, at times flushed; the tem- perature is usually low, but at times raised; the pulse is full and slow, often not beating more than 40 to the minute; the respiration is slow, laboured, and stertorous, i.e., a peculiar noise is made during expiration by the flapping of the paralysed soft palate; the cheeks and lips puff out at each expiration in. consequence of paralysis of the buccinator and muscles of the lips; the pupils are fixed (*.e., the iris does not respond to light), and may be either dilated or contracted, or one may be dilated and the other contracted; the urine is at first retained owing to the paralysis of the muscular coat of the bladder, but afterwards dribbles away as the bladder becomes over- distended and will hold no more; the faeces pass in- voluntarily consequent upon paralysis of the sphincters'; at times there are violent convulsions. When on the other hand the pressure is localized the coma is usually less profound, the pupil on one side only may be fixed and the paralysis may be limited to one side, possibly to an arm or leg, or to one side of the face or there may be con- vulsive twitching of certain muscles or of a limb. The compression-symptoms may gradually deepen till the patient dies; or he may recover on the removal of the cause, e.g., a piece of bone or a clot of blood. The diagnosis of the cause of the compression will rest on the fact that when due to bone or blood the symptoms come on within twenty-four hours of the injury, gene- rally directly if due to bone, or after a brief interval of consciousness if due to blood; but not till three or four days after the injury if due to the pressure of inflamma- tory exudation or of pus, in which case, morever, they are preceded by signs of inflammation. Where the signs are general, as given above, the injury usually depends upon the pressure of extravasated blood on some of the central portions of the brain following upon laceration of the brain-substance, or upon general inflammation of the brain or its membranes. But when the signs are those of local pressure on the surface of the brain, the lesion will probably be due to a depressed portion of bone or a cir- cumscribed extravasation of blood between the bone and dura mater, or a collection of pus either between the bone and dura mater or in the cortical substance of the brain.

EXCISION or THE TOIS^GUE. 573 tip as far back as to be well beyond tbe disease. This allows the tongue to be readily'split with the fingers into two halves. The cord of the ecraseur is now passed over one half, and well behind the disease, and, if the whole tongue is to be removed, the cord of a second ecraseur over the other half. The cord being tightened by screw- ing up the ecraseur, the tongue is cut through. The lingual artery, with the gustatory nerve, is drawn out in the form of a loop by the cord of the ecraseur (Fig. 205). A ligature should be passed round the artery with an Fia. 205.â€”Excision of the tongue with the ecraseur. aneurysm needle, and the artery severed in front of the ligature. The anterior part of the tongue will now come away, leaving the ligature on the artery in the stump of the tongue. The above is a slight modification of the operation introduced by Mr. Morrant Baker. 3. Excision with the scissors as practised by Mr. White- head, consists in drawing the tongue well forward by a ligature through its tip, dividing the frsenum, and then separating the tongue from its attachments beginning from below by a series of short snips with blunt-pointed scissors, tying the lingual arteries, if seen, before they are divided, or else immediately they are cut. To prevent haemorrhage during the operation, some Surgeons first tie the lingual artery in the neck, whilst others, for fear of blood entering the trachea, perform tracheotomy, and plug

DISEASES OF THE SCALP AND SKULL. 501 SECTION YI. Diseases of Eegions. diseases of the scalp and skull. Erysipelas of the scalp is very common, and may occur idiopathically, or as the result of a wound. In the so-called idiopathic cases, however, it is probable that there is generally some scratch or abrasion through which the specific micrococcus gains admission. The inflamma- tion spreads with great rapidity, but is accompanied by very little redness and swelling, on account of the tense- ness of the parts. It is apt to be attended with headache, drowsiness, or delirium, consequent upon the hypersemia extending to the pia mater. See Erysipelas, p. 147. Cellulitis of the scalp is usually due to a wound, and is described under Injuries of the Scalp. (See also Cellulitis.) Abscess may occur above the aponeurosis, between the aponeurosis and the pericranium, or beneath the peri- cranium. It is generally the result of an injury, but may be due to the breaking down of gummata, disease of the bones, &c. It is further referred to under Injuries of the Head (p. 353). EoDENT ULCEE, and epithelioma of the scalp, require no special mention. Sebaceous cysts are very common on the scalp, where they are at times hereditary. They are frequently multiple, and as they increase in size, the hair covering them falls off, and they appear as bare, rounded tumours. The signs, secondary changes, diagnosis, and treatment of these cysts have been given at p. 96. All that need here be repeated is that the mass of granulations which some- times protrudes from the walls of these cysts {/ungating ulcer of the scalp) closely resembles epithelioma, from which, however, it may generally be distinguished by the absence of induration and glandular enlargement, and by the history of a sebaceous cyst having been previously

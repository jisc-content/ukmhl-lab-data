Method of union.—When the fractur-e is transverse, union is generally fibrous or membraneous, rarely osseous, in consequence of the fragments being separated, probably in part by muscular contraction, and in part by the effusion of blood, and later of serous fluid, into the joint. In the vertical and starred fractures, where the parts are held together by the untorn aponeurosis, union is usually osseous. Signs, —At first a gap between the fragments can be Fig. 168.—Malgaigne's hooks, seen and felt, but it is with key. subsequently obscured by swelling of the joint. The patient cannot stand, or extend the knee. In a vertical fracture crepitus can usually be detected, and the fragments are not separated. Fia. 169.—Manning's patella splint. The leg is drawn in outline, so as to show beneath it the webbing band passing through the slit in the splint. The strips of strapping should reach up the thigh to the gluteal fold. Treatment.—If seen before effusion has occurred, the whole limb from the ankle to the hip should be enclosed in a Bavarian plaster-of-Paris splint, and the patient " confined to bed for a week, and then allowed to get about on crutches. Even when effusion has set in, this plan may be attended with the best results. Usually, however, the limb is placed on a back-splint with the foot raised so as to relax the muscles in front of the thigh, ice or cold lotion applied till the swelling has subsided, and then an endeavour made to draw down the upper frag-

TUMOURS or BONE. 247 from the deep layers of the periosteum, and as they in- crease in size invade the bone beneath on the one hand, and the soft tissues surrounding them on the other, till finally the skin is involved, and they protrude as a fun- gous mass if the patient has not been already carried of£ by the dissemination of the growth through internal organs. They are very prone to calcification and ossifica- tion and are then sometimes spoken of as osteoid sarco- mata ; but the simple expression ossifying sarcomata, as less misleading, and as more indicative of what really Fig. 63.—Endosteal sarcoma in head of tibia. (St. Bartholo- mew's Hospital Museum.) happens, had better be employed. Their favourite situa- tions are the neighbourhood of the large joints, which however they seldom involve. Though not usually implicating the lymphatic glands, they often rapidly infect the system through the blood-stream and quickly return after removal. The endosteal or central spring from the medulla in the interior of the bone, and are of slower growth and generally less malignant than the periosteal. As they increase in size they expand the bone around them into a thin shell (Fig. 63) which finally gives way, when they grow with greater rapidity, behaving as the periosteal variety. The myeloid form of the endosteal sarcoma is the least malignant, and may not return after enucleation or complete removal for

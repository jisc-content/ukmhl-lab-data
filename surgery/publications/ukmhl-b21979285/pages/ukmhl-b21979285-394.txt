378 INJURIES OF REGIONS. be known by the bone-dust being soft and red, greater caution must be used, and a quill or probe introduced into the groove at intervals to ascertain whether perfora- tion has taken place at any situation. When the crown of bone is loose it should be removed with the sequestrum forceps, and if it is intended to replace it, it should be kept warm in some weak antiseptic solution, and, at the end of the operation, cut into small pieces and placed in the hole, and the flap laid down over it. If more room is necessary, the trephine hole may be enlarged by a Hey's saw, Hof- man's or Keen's forcej)s, or by the surgical engine. It need hardly be said that the strictest antiseptic jorecautions should be used through- out. Thus, the whole scalp should be shaved, and washed with soap and hot water, then with ether, turpentine, or ammonia, to remove all grease, and afterwards with perchloride of mercury or other antiseptic. Healing by the first intention should be obtained if possible by accurately uniting the wound except perhaps at its lowest part, which may be left open for drainage, and by applying a dry antiseptic dressing, and over it an ice-bag to prevent inflammation. The trephine should not be applied, as a rule, over a suture, an air or venous sinus, or over the middle meningeal artery, unless the operation is undertaken with a view to secure that vessel. The conical trephine, shown in Fig. 102, will be found a safer instrument than that in ordinary use, as with it the dura mater is less likely to be injured, and the handle also is more comfort- able to work with. Before trephining for the removal of a cerebral tumour morphia should be given, as it causes contraction of the small blood-vessels, and so has a tendency to lessen the hsemorrhage. The chloroform, however, should be given in much smaller quantities when the patient is under the influence of morphia. Fm. 102. â€” Conical trephine, with the authors improved handle.

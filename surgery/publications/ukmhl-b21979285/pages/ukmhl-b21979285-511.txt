FRACTUEES OF THE TIBIA AND FIBIJLA. 495 third, and then the fibula also at its weakest spot, ^'.e., in its upper third, and the fractures are usually oblique. In the transverse fracture but little displacement occurs; in the oblique, in which the line of fracture usually runs downwards, forwards, and a little inwards, the lower fragments are drawn upwards, backwards and outwards, behind the upper, by the muscles of the calf, while the sharp end of the upper fragment of the tibia projects forwards, threatening, and indeed often causing, perforation of the skin (Fig. 171). Fracture of the tibia alone is generally caused by direct vio- lence, as a kick or a blow on the shin, occasionally by indirect violence, as a fall on the foot. Nature of the displacement,—The fracture is usually situated in the lower third of the bone, and is generally transverse, and at- tended by little displacement, the fragments being held in posi- tion by the fibula, which plays the part of a splint. Fractures of the upper and lower ends, involving the knee- and ankle- joints respectively, and separa- tion of the upper and lower epiphysis, may also occur, but are rare. Fracture of the fibula alone is more common than fracture of Fig. 171.—Fracture of the the tibia alone. Cause.—Though l^^er third of the tibia, sometimes produced by direct it is (After Gfray.) more often the result of indirect violence,_such as a severe wrench or twist of the foot. The fracture is then generally situated from two to three inches from the external malleolus, and the foot is at the same time very commonly dislocated either outwards or inwards, according to the direction of the force. Nature of the dis- placement,—In the fracture with outward dislocation of the foot {Potfs fracture, as it is generally called), the upper end of the lower fragment is driven inwards towards the tibia, the external lateral ligament remains intact, but

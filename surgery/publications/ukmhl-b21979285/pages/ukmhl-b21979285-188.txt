172 GENERAL PATHOLOGY OF INJURIES. Treatment.â€”Nothing in the way of specifics has hitherto been found for the disease. Curare, Indian hemp, Calabar bean, eserine, and numerous other drugs have been tried, and signally failed, at least in the acute form of the disease. Chloroform, although it prevents the spasms while the patient is under its influence, appears to be of no permanent benefit. Eecently, however, hypodermic injections of carbolic acid \ grain, and paraldehyde, pilo- carpine and urethane, have been said to be successful. But our chief hope in acute cases appears to be in attempting to tide the patient through the first few da^^s on the chance that the affection may become chronic. Thus his strength should be supported with fluid nourish- ment, administered by the rectum if he is unable to swallow, and the spasms as much as possible prevented by the most absolute quiet, the avoidance of all sources of irritation, and the employment of such sedatives as Indian hemp, bromide of potassium, urethane, paralde- hyde, chloral or opium. If the latter is chosen, it should be pushed to the extreme verge of safety. In the few cases I have seen recover, the patient was treated by excessive doses of this drug. The bowels should be cleared by purgatives or enemata. Injections of carbolic acid or of hydrochlorate of pilocarpine ma}^ be tried. Locally, under any circumstances, means should be taken to render the wound aseptic, and in the light of recent researches that seem to show that tetanus is due to a poison generated by micro-organisms which exist only in the wound, the practice of free excision of the injured part and subsequent thorough cauterization on the first appearance of the symptoms, commends itself for adoption.

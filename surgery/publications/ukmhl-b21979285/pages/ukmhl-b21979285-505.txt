FRACTtJEES OF THE EEMTTR. 489 pressure on these parts. By its use both limbs are kept parallel, and abduction or adduction of the fractured limb is prevented, whilst extension is kept up by means of the elastic apparatus attached to the side of the splint and connected by cords and pulleys to the foot-piece, which moves up and down in a slot. If the foot of the bed is raised no perineal band is required. 2. The weigJit and pulley is frequently used, either alone, or as an addition to the long splint. A long piece of strapping is secured on each side of the leg and lower third of the thigh by strapping and a bandage, leaving a loop about eight inches long under the sole. In the loop thus left a flat piece of wood, about two inches square, is placed, and through a hole in the centre of this a cord is Fig. 164.â€”Bryant's splint. passed and secured by a knot at its end. The cord is then carried over a pulley at the foot of the bed, and a weight of several pounds suspended on it. The weight should be gradually increased till the fractured limb is found on measurement to be the same length as the sound limb. Ten to twenty pounds or even more may be required. Counter-extension is made by the weight of the body, the foot of the bed being raised six inches or so on blocks. But the many details involved in its application will be better learnt by three months' dressing in the wards than by any verbal description. In children, the limb may be suspended by means of this stirrup in a vertical position to the ceiling (Fig. 165), the weight of the body being the counter-extending force. 3. The douhle-inclined plane is very useful in the treat- ment of fractures of the upper third of the femur, in which the upper fragment is tilted upwards by the psoas and iliacus, and cannot be kept in apposition with the lower. By means of the double-inclined plane the lower fragment

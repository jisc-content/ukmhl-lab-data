PHIMOSIS. 797 Phimosis is a condition in which, the prepuce is elon- gated, and its orifice contracted, so that it cannot be drawn back over the glans. It may occur as a congenital affection ; or it may be acquired, and is then usually due j to the cicatricial contraction of the orifice following I syphilitic ulceration or repeated attacks of gonorrhoea. I The orifice when very small may cause difiiculty of micturition or even retention of urine ; whilst the strain- ing to pass water may induce prolapse of the rectum, hernia, irritation of the bladder, and symptoms of stone, and if not relieved may produce the harmful effects on the urinary organs described under stricture; or the Fig. 312.—SeiziDg the prepuce preparatory to the operation of circumcision. (Bryant s Surgery.) deposit of the urinary salts beneath the prepuce may lead I to the formation of preputial calculi. The inability to uncover the glans may cause pain and difficulty in coitus, and by preserving a mucous membrane-like character to the glans predispose to venereal disease ; whilst the secre- tion which collects beneath the prepuce may, in conse- sequenceof the irritation it is apt to set up, induce priapism, habits of masturbation, inflammation sometimes simula- ting gonorrhoea, adhesion of the glans to the prepuce, or even as age advances the formation of an epithelioma. The treatment may be considered under the heads of 1, cirmmciston; 2, slitting the prepuce; and 3, dilatation of the preputial orifice, 1.

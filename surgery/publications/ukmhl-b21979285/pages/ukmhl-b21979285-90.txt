Usual seats.—Fibromata may grow from the connective tissue anywhere, but the harder forms are chiefly met with in the periosteum, especially that of the jaws {fibrous epulis), in the uterus where they are intermixed with unstriped muscle {myo-fibroma), in the neurilemma of nerves {false fieuroma), on the termination of nerves {painful subcutaneous tumour), and in the naso-pharynx Fig. 8.—Fibrous tumour. Firm variety. and rectum (fibrous polypus). The softer forms grow from the subcutaneous and submucous tissue, and the inter- muscular septa, and are most frequently met with in the scrotum, labium, and scalp. The loose-textured, large and often pendulous growths, occurring in the sub- cutaneous tissue, and known as wens, and the small, sessile, or partially-pedunculated tumours scattered over the body in the condition known as molluscum fibrosum, are varieties of soft fibromata. The signs and diagnosis of fibromata vary according to their situation, and will be again referred to under the diseases of the various regions in which they occur. The firm fibromata are usually oval or globular, smooth, pain- less unless attached to a nerve, moveable, very firm and hard, and generally single. The softer forms are smooth, globular, elastic, soft and painless, especially when

90 GENERAL PATHOLOGY OE STJHGICAL DISEASES. colloid variety, which is probably a degenerated condition of one or other of the former, or indeed of any variety of carcinoma. 1. The SPHEROIDAL-CELLED Or ACINOUS CARCINOMATA consist of epithelial cells resembling spheroidal or glandu- lar epithelium, and only grow in connection with glands. They usually exhibit the characteristic alveolar structure of the carcinomata in a well-marked degree. They are divided into the hard spheroidal-celled, the soft spheroidal- celled, and the colloid varieties. {a.) The hard spheroidal-celled carcinomata^ the scirrhous or chronic cancers are moderate-sized, hard, nodular, and Fig. 16.—Hard spheroidal-celled or scirrhous carcinoma. comparatively slowly-growing tumours, which, sooner or later, ulcerate and become disseminated through the body. Structure.—They are characterized by the large amount of their stroma (Fig. 16). Indeed, the central parts of the growth, in some cases, consist of little else than dense fibrous tissue, with a few atrophied and fatty-looking cells in the shrunken alveoli. The circumferential parts of such tumours, however, still display the typical charac- ters of acinous carcinoma, and in the surrounding tissues the epithelial invasion and the small-cell-infiltration are still going on. It is owing to the excessive forma- tion of fibrous tissue that the scirrhous cancer is so hard, and creaks under the knife when cut; and to the tendency of the fibrous tissue to shrink, that the skin

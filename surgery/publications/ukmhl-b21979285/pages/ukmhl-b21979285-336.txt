Subscapular. making an incision, with the arm raised, through the skin and fascia along the inner border of the coraco-brachialis and biceps (Fig. 90, b). In the first and second parts of its course it lies below the pec- toral muscles, and to expose ^ it so deep a dissection is re- quired, that ligature of the subclavian is preferable. The collateral circulation (Figs. 88 and 89) after ligature of the first portion of the axillary is carried on by the same vessels as after ligature of the third part of the subclavian. After ligature of the third part of the axillary it is carried on by the anastomosis of small branches of the subscapular and circumflex above with similar branches of the supe- rior profunda below. The BRACHIAL ABTERY may require ligature for—1, wound of the artery; 2, aneurysm at the bend of the elbow; 3, wound of the palma^r arch. It may be tied in any part of its course. Make an incision (Fig. 90, c), along the inner edge of the biceps in a line drawn from the anterior fold of the axilla to the middle of the bend of the elbow through the integuments and deep fascia, avoiding the basilic vein which lies over the course of the artery but superficial to the fascia. The median nerve crosses the artery along the middle of its course from with- out inwards. At the lend^ of the elhow make the incision

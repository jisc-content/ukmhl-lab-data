490 INJURIES OF BEGIOICS. is raised and brougM into line with the upper, extension being secured by the leg and foot hanging unsupported down the further side of the plane, and counter-extension by the weight of the body. The plane may consist of an ordinary Maclntyre's splint bent to the proper angle, or of a wooden frame that can be adjusted to the proper height at the apex where the planes meet. Dr. Hodgen's and Dr. Nathan Smith's splints are double-inclined planes slung on pulleys, but space does not permit of them being described here. 4. Plaster - of' Paris and starch handages are employed at some hospitals from the first, and the patient allowed to get about on crutches. III. Fractijees through the LOWER END OE THE FEMUR VCry frequently extend either trans- versely or obliquely across the shaft, just above the articular surface, and vertically or obliquely between the condyles into the knee- joint, the broken end of the shaft being often impacted between the partially separated condyles. Some- times the line of fracture may be entirely supracondyloid, the knee- joint then escaping. In young subjects the fracture may occur in the epiphysial line, with or without splintering of the condyles. De- structive inflammation of the knee- joint is liable to follow fractures through the condyles, but is certainly far from common. The signs, when the fracture is supra-condyloid, are similar to those of fracture of the lower third of the shaft. In the T-shaped fracture in which the knee is involved, there is usually great swelling of the joint from effusion of blood and serum; increased width of the femur if the condyles are separated from each other; shortening; inability to stand on or use the limb; and crepitus on manipulation, on grasping the condyles, and often on moving the patella laterally.

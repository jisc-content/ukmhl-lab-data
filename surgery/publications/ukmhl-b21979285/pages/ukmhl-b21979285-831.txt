SYPHILITIC DISEASE OF THE TESTICLE. 815 spoon. If a fungus forms it will frequently recede under rest in bed, cleanliness, and the application of a stimu- lating ointment or of iodoform. Should the testicle become completely disorganized it had better be excised. Syphilitic disease of the testicle occurs during the late secondary and the tertiary stages of syphilis. Pathology.—The lesion in the earlier stages of syphilis usually takes the form of a small-cell-infiltration of the intertubular connective tissue; in the later stages, of distinct gummatous masses, resembling gummata in other Fig. 317.—-Syphilitic testicle. Grummatous variety. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) situations. The body of the testicle alone is usually affected, and though, in some instances, syphilitic epididymi- tis is met with, the cord and epididymis generally escape. In the secondary stage both testicles may be implicated, either simultaneously, or, as more often happens, one after the other, the disease here, as in other secondary affections, manifesting its tendency to be symmetrical. Under appropriate treatment the small-cell-infiltration may be completely absorbed, leaving the testicle apparently little, if at all affected ; or it may undergo fibroid changes, and the subsequent shrinking of the fibrous tissue produce more or less atrophy of the organ. But it seldom breaks down and suppurates as the gummatous form in patients with undermined constitutions is apt to do. In the ter- tiary affection one testicle only is, as a rule, involved, the asymmetrical character of tertiary syphilis being thus

DISEASES OF REGION'S. 752 slightly depress the handle to raise the blades from the wall of the bladder, and screw home. The stone will probably be felt to crack and break into fragments. If the stone cannot be seized in this way, systematically explore the bladder thus :—Open the blades and rotate 45 degrees; pause and close. Do this first to the right, then to the left. Then raise the blades slightly by depressing the handle ; rotate alternately to right and left 90 degrees; further Fm. 290.—Lithotrite in sUii. (Listen's Surgery.) raise the blades and rotate 135 degrees. Finally, reverse the blades by rotating half a circle. In this way the stone will probably be found. In these manoeuvres the blades should be opened before rotating them in order that the stone may not be displaced by the male blade, and after rotating a pause should be made before closing them to allow the currents to subside. Having crushed the stone and larger fragments, withdraw the lithotrite, first screwing tight home to ensure complete closure of the blades in order to prevent laceration of the urethra. Next introduce a large evacuating catheter (No. 16, or larger); let the urine escape and inject two or three ounces of warm water. Attach the aspirator, previously filled with water at a temperature of 98°, and compress the india-rubber

GENERAL PATHOLOGY OF INJURIES. 104 lymph, uniting the surfaces of the wound, together with the tissues immediately adjacent to the incision, next become softened and finally replaced by the infiltrating leucocytes and proliferating cells on the surface of the Fig. 21.—Diagram of an incised wound a day or two after the incision.

The infiammation, like all inflammations of traumatic origin, tends to cease as soon as the cause is Fig. 22.—Diagram of an incised wound, a few days after the incision.

Thus in a day or two it subsides, and if a sec- tion of the parts were now made, the uniting layer of small round cells could be seen permeated by delicate new capillaries stretching across from one side of the wound to the other (Fig. 22).

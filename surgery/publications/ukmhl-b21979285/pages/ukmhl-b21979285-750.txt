DISEASES OF EEGIOIfS. 734 Urinary Deposits and Calculi^ Urinary deposits are divided into the unorgaiiized and the organized. A. The unorganized consists of the urates, the uric acid, the oxalate of lime, the phosphates, the cystic oxide, the uric oxide and the carbonate of lime. Only the more common of these are described. 1. The urates formerly called lit hates, are the most common of the urinary deposits, and are formed by the combination of uric acid with ammonia, soda, or lime. They occur in acid urine as an amorphous sediment, varying in colour from a white or a pale fawn to a brick- FiG. 280.â€”Urates. (Bryant's Surgery.) dust red. They only appear as the urine cools, andl disappear again on the application of heat, or on adding alkalies. Though generally amorphous they sometimes present the crystalline forms seen in Fig. 280. 2. The uric acid deposits, which are the next most common, occur only in very acid urine, as a yellowish- pink, red, or brick-dust red crystalline sediment. The crystals are often of large size, and the deposit is then known as red sand or gravel. They usually occur as rhombic prisms, or long oval plates with acute angles, and are often mixed, forming rosettes. The various kinds

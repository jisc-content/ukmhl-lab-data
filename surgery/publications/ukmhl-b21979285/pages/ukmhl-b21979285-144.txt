128 GENERAL PATHOLOGY OE INJURIES. forming a plug of vascular granulation-tissue. The granulation-tissue is next converted into fibrous tissue, which, gradually contracts and obliterates the newly- formed vessels, till finally the internal clot together with the artery is converted as far as the first collateral branch into a firm fibrous cord. Similar changes, in the meanwhile, occur in the^ ex- ternal clot, and it is finally blended with the scar tissue formed by the healing of the wound of the soft parts around the injured artery. When an artery is divided in its continuity, the healing of the distal end is accomplished in a similar manner, except that the internal clot in the distal end is often Fia. 27.-â€”Spencer Wells' pressure forceps, modified by Morrant Baker. less perfectly produced, and may not be formed at all. Consequently secondary haemorrhage is more frequent from the lower than from the upper end of a ligatured artery. The above description applies chiefly to a complete division of an artery. When an artery is rcierely punc- tured, the arrest of haemorrhage will depend upon the size of the vessels, and the size and direction of the puncture. A wound, however small, of the aorta, or vessel next removed in size, will probably be fatal. In a vessel of less magnitude, when the puncture is small, a clot forms of an hour-glass shape, thus blocking up the wound, and healing occurslBy adhesive inflammation. A somewhat larger wound, when made longitudinally to the artery, may heal in the same way; but when made transversely to the axis of the vessel, it assumes a diamond shape, in consequence of the elastic tension of the coats, and the haemorrhage will probably not be arrested.

The turbinated bodies appear decreased in size, and the mucous membrane is atrophied and paler than natural, and covered with hard yellowish-green adherent crusts. Grenerally, though not invariably, the disease is attended with a horrible foetor, which is usually thought to be due to the decomposition of the discharge beneath the crusts, the discharge being secreted in too small quantities Fig. 219.—Hypertrophy of the posterior ends of the inferior turbi- nated bodies, with adenoid vegetations in the vault of the pharynx. and too thick to allow of the throwing-o:ff of the crusts.

In all forms an important point to remember is that ulceration does not occur. Treatment.—In the early stages much can be done in the way of treatment, and by perseverance a cure may be obtained. In the atrophic variety relief from the dis- tressing symptom of foetor only can be expected. In all forms the general health must be attended to. Thus, in the strumous, cod-liver oil or maltine, and the syrup of the iodide or phosphate of iron, are indicated. Locally, in the simple and milder forms of the hypertrophic, the treat- ment consists in cleansing the parts and then applying astringents ; the cleansing may be accomplished by simply blowing the nose, or if this is not sufficient, a cleansing fluid must be used. There are many of these. The one I

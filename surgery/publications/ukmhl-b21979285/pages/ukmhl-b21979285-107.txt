Usual seats.—-The breast; but scirrhous cancer also occurs in the oesophagus, pylorus, and, more rarely, in other situations. The general appearance of scirrhous cancer, the symptoms, diagnosis, varieties and treat- ment, are given under Diseases of the Breast, its favourite seat. (h.) The soft spheroidal-celled carcinomatay the medullary, encephaloid or acute cancers, are much more rapid in their growth than the preceding variety, and form soft and Fia. 17.—Soft spheroidal-celled or medullary carcinoma. often large tumours, quickly terminating in ulceration and general dissemination through the body. Structure. —The stroma is scanty in amount (Fig. 17), and does not contract like that of scirrhus; the cells, which are very prone to undergo fatty degeneration, ave contained in large alveoli. They are very vascular, and as the scanty stroma affords but little support to the vessels, extensive haemorrhages into the substance of the growth are com- mon. On section, they appear of a greyish-white or cream-colour, blotched in places with blood, whilst in the centre they may be almost diffluent, consequent upon their having undergone fatty degeneration. On account of the resemblance to brain-matter the older pathologists termed them encephaloid cancers. After they have in- volved the skin, they protrude in the form of a bleeding fungating mass, and hence were further called fungus hmmatodes. Although in accordance with general usage,

If it is found, after urine has been passed, that the bladder still retains some ounces, then catheterism must be commenced. A soft catheter, or when the middle lobe is enlarged, a coude or bi-coude (Figs. 296, 297), should be used at regular intervals, and any cystitis which may exist should be treated as already described. As the disease advances the passage of the catheter may cause a very irritable condition of the bladder. Under Fig. 296.—Coude catheter. such circumstances it becomes a question whether the bladder should be tapped above the pubes, and a cannula kept permanently in; or whether an incision in the middle line of the perineum should be made to drain the bladder. I prefer the latter method. When retention occurs, and it cannot be relieved by a catheter, the bladder must be tapped above the pubes. Eecently the obstruction has been overcome by punching out a piece of Fig. 297.—Bi-coude catheter. the prostate with an instrument invented for the purpose, by boring a new channel with the galvano-cautery, and by opening the bladder above the pubes and removing with the knife or cautery the obstructing portion of the middle lobe {prostatectomy). The removal of the ob- structing middle lobe holds out the best prospect of success. Tubercle oe the prostate may occur in the course of general tuberculosis, or in connection with tubercular disease of the genito-urinary tract. It gives rise to in- flammation, and sometimes suppuration, in or about the organ; but its diagnosis will depend on the presence of tubercle in other parts, as the testicle, bladder, vesiculse seminales, &c. The local scraping away of caseous material may give some temporary relief.

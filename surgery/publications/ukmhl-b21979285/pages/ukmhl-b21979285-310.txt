The artery under such circumstances may remain pervious, or become converted into a fibrous cord as far as the first collateral branch above and below the seat of the aneurysm. Such a favourable termination may be brought about by the retardation of the blood current induced by—(1) the lowering of the heart's action; (2) the pressure of the aneurysm on the artery above its opening into the sac (Fig. 81, c); (3) the partial blocking of the mouth of the sac with a piece of detached coagulum; (4) the impaction of a piece of clot in the artery below the mouth of the sac (Fig. 81, b) ; (5) the pressure of another aneurysm or of a tumour upon the artery above the sac or Fia. 81.—Diagram to show methods of spontaneous cure of aneurysm. A. by laminated clot, b. by plugging of artery below, c. by pres- sure of aneurysm on artery above mouth of sac, d. by plugging of mouth of sac and formation of passive clot. on the sac itself; (6) the aneurysm rupturing, and the effused blood compressing the artery leading to the aneurysm. B. By the filling of the sac luith ordinary coagulum, the passive clot as it is called, in contradistinction to the deposit of laminated fibrin (the active clot). This coagula- tion of the blood in the sac may be brought about by—(1) the complete blocking of the mouth of the sac by a piece of detached clot (Fig. 81, d), or (2) the complete plugging of the artery above and below the aneurysm. The clot may then undergo the ordinary changes that occur in the so- called organization of blood-clot and be converted into fibrous tissue. C. By the inflammation and sloughing of the sac and the plugging of the artery above and below with clot and the subsequent changes described under the spontaneous arrest of hsemorrhage. A fatal termination may be brought about by—1, rup-

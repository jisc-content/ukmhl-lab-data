463 FRACTURES OF THE ULN'A. The ulna.—Fractures of the ulna may be divided into fracture of—1, the olecranon; 2, the coronoid process; and 3, the shaft. 1. The olecranon may be fractured in a transverse or oblique direction. The elbow-joint is always involved, Fig. 145.—Grordon's splint for Colles' fracture. (G-ordon's Fractures.) Fia. 146.—Fracture of olecranon. (Listen's Surgery.) except when the fracture is through the tip of the process only.

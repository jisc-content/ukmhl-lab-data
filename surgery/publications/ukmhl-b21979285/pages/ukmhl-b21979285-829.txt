TUBEECLE OE THE TESTICLE. 813 (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) epididymitis, in addition to internal remedies, inunction with, mercurial ointment may be of service. TuBEECULAH DISEASE OF THE TESTIS, also known as strumous orchitis, or strumous sarcocele, is variously believed to depend upon the presence of tbe tubercle bacillus, or upon a chronic inflammation in a strumous subject, and to begin either as a tubercular affection in the intertubular connective tissue, or as a catarrhal inflammation in the interior of the tubules. Pathology.—Opportunities for examining the testicle in the early stages of the disease are not common. Hence, the uncertainty as to the origin and exact nature of the inflammation. Typical nodules of tubercle, how- ever, have been found, and tubercle bacilli have been demonstrated either in sections of the organ or, when few in number, after cultivation. The disease generally begins in the epididymis, and thence may spread to the body of the organ. It may also extend up the vas to the vesiculee seminales and prostate, and thence to the bladder, and even to the ureters and kidneys. In some cases the testicle appears to be the starting point of a general tuberculosis; in others, merely to be involved in common with other organs in the general disease. In many instances, however, the disease may remain localized to the testicle, and no other manifestation of tubercle Fig. 316.—Tubercle of the testicle.

STOGICAL METHODS OF ARRESTmO H^MORKHAGE. 129 The suegical methods of arresting hemorrhage may be considered under tlie heads of temporary and permanent methods. 1. Temporary methods,—The surgeon, if the bleeding point IS within reach, need never fear hsemorrhage, as mere pressure with the finger will control it, whatever the size of the vessel, till he can obtain the means of permanently arresting it. The pressure may be made directly on the bleeding point, or between the wound and the heart; in the former situation with the finger, Fig. 28.—Petit's Tourniquet. Fig. 29.—Signoroni's Tourniquet. Spencer Wells' pressure forceps (Fig. 27), or the tour- niquet ; in the latter situation with the finger or the tourniquet, the pressure being then made in such a direction as to press the artery against some resisting structure, as a point of bone. The tourniquets employed are various (Fig. 28 and Fig. 29). The rubber tube of the Esmarch's apparatus perhaps answers the best. An im- promptu tourniquet may be made by tying a pocket- handkerchief loosely round the limb, and twisting it up tightly with a walking-stick or umbrella. These tem- porary means, however, should only be trusted to until more permanent methods can be applied. 2. Permanent methods.—The agents employed for per- manently arresting haemorrhage are—1. Cold, 2., Heat, 3. Pressure, 4:. IStyptics, 5. CavMry, 6. Ligature, 7. Torsion, 8. Acupressure, 9. Forcipressure,

On the evacuation of the pus either naturally as above, or through an incision artificially made, the walls fall more or less together, and the cavity is gradually filled up by granulations till finally only a scar remains. The minute changes concerned in this process are briefly as follows:—The leucocytes which have escaped from the vessels in the way already described, together with the cells resulting from the proliferation of the original tissue elements, aggregate at the focus of inflammation around the micro-organisms which, if not already present as the cause of the inflammation, have

603 DISEASES OE THE SEPTUM NASI. I lateral cartilages, and frequently gives rise to chronic 1 nasal catarrh, and to many distressing symptoms, snch ! as frontal headache, nasal tone of voice, passage of mucus I into the pharynx, &c. Treatment.—The septum may j generally be forcibly straightened by the forceps shown ! in Fig. 221, and then retained in position for the first few I days, while the parts are becoming consolidated, by the retentive apparatus shown in Fig. 222, and subsequently j by ivory or vulcanite plugs (Fig. 223). I have found I hollow plugs (Fig. 224) useful in that they do not so ! completely obstruct nasal respiration. In some instances ! Fig. 225.—iluthor's nasal Fig. 226.—Author's fixation cap j mask. and nasal truss. portions of the prominent septum may be removed by the nasal saw with advantage. Where the lateral cartilages and nasal bones are deviated they can generally be straightened, even after many years have elapsed since the injury. Great force, however, is required, and care must be taken, by properly padding the forceps, not to injure the soft parts. One of the best forms of retentive apparatus then is, perhaps, the mask shown in the accom- panying diagram (Fig. 225), since by its means a fixed point is secured to work from. As the mask, however, is irksome to some patients I have more recently, for suit- able cases, employed the nasal cap and truss depicted in Fig. 226. Cartilaginous and osseous tumours of the septum, though rare, occasionally occur, and can be readily diagnosed from ^ a deflection of the septum, by their hard and resisting nature and the absence of a corresponding depression in the opposite nostril. Their removal is the proper treatment.

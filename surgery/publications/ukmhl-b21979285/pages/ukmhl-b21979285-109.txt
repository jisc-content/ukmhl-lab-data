TUMOURS—EPITHELIOMATA. 93 pipe-stem, in the scrotum to the retention of soot or coal- tar in the folds of the skin. They are also not uncommon in situations where the epithelium is in an abnormal con- dition, as in old scars, white patches on the tongue and inside of the cheek, chronic ulcers, warts, and moles. Structure, — Squamous-celled carcinomata consist of columns of epithelium, which have grown into the con- nective or other underlying tissue, surrounded by an imperfectly fibrillated stroma, and a small-cell-infiltra- tion. At the same time the epithelium is usually also proliferated outwards, forming a warty excrescence or Fig. 18.—Squamous-celled carcinoma (epithelioma). The small- cell-infiltration around the epithelial columns is less marked than usual. cauliflower-like growth. Breaking down rapidly ensues, and an epitheliomatous ulcer is the result. Amongst the cells forming the columns of invading epithelium are found in places small collections of cells of a crescentic shape, arranged concentrically around one or more central rounded cells. These collections, spoken of as cell-nests, are probably due to the more rapid growth of the epithe- lium at certain spots, the shape and arrangement of the peripheral layers of cells being due to their compression between the rapidly-growing central cells and the sur- rounding tissues. In the accompanying wood-cut (Fig. 18) the down- growing epithelial columns, a column in transverse sec- tion, and several cell-nests are seen.

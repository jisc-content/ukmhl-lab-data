718 DISEASES OF REGIONS. the constant action of the sphincter, degenerate into a fistula (Figs. 276, 277, and 278). TiSTULA m ANO is a fistulous track by the side of the rectum.. Three forms are described:—1. The complete (Fig. 276), in which the fistula opens internally into the rectum, and externally on to the skin; 2. The hUnd external (Fig. 278), in which it only opens on to the skin ; and 3. The blind internal (Fig. 277), in which it only opens into the bowel. The complete (Fig. 276) is by far the most common form. It generally extends obliquely upwards on one side of the rectum and opens into the bowel within an inch above the anus, or it may take a curved course around the bowel and then open into it (the horsesJioe Fig. 275. — Fig. 276. — Fig. 277. — Fig. 278. — Ischio-rectal Complete Blind inter- Blind exter- abscess. listula. nal fistula. nal fistula. fistula). Frequently it extends up beyond the internal opening by the side of the rectum in the form of a cid-de- sac ; or it may, though very rarely, open into the bowel several inches above the anus. In rare instances there may be two internal openings. Secondary fistulae branch- ing ofit from the main fistula are often found burrowing beneath the skin of the perineum and buttock, and some- times opening at a considerable distance from the anus. The external opening, however, is usually about half an inch from the anus ; but it may be a greater distance from it; or close to it, and then, perhaps, hidden by the loose folds of skin. It may be little more than a minute hole exuding a slight moisture; or it may be encircled by a ring of granulations, and the skin in its neighbour- hood may be red and brawny. The fistulous track itself will generally be found lined with a smooth shining membrane, and its walls indurated when it has existed some time. Causes.—A fistula is generally the result either of the bursting of an ischio-rectal abscess into the bowel, or on

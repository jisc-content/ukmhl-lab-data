638 DISEASES OF REGIONS. (Fig. 244). The cause of the rotation has been vari- ously explained. The theory, perhaps, most generally accepted is that of Dr. Judson, who believes that the rotation is due to the fact that the posterior portion of the vertebral column, being a part of the dorsal parietes of the chest and abdomen, is confined by the ligaments and muscles to the median plane of the trunk; whilst the anterior portion projecting into the thoracic and abdominal cavities, being devoid of lateral attachments, is free to move either to the right or left of the median plane when the spine is inclined to either side. At first the bones are not affected, but when the compression of the cartilages Fig. 244.—To show the effect of rotation in lateral curvature of the spine. has become permanent the bodies of the vertebrae also gradually assume a wedge shape, whilst the articular processes become contracted and flattened on the concave side and elongated on the convex. The ligaments and muscles on the concave side are shortened and atrophied, whilst on the convex side the ligaments are stretched and the muscles become hypertrophied. Signs.—Pain or a feeling of weakness in the back, general lassitude, and a stooping gait are amongst the early symptoms; but the patient is generally first brought for consultation on account of a slight projection of the scapula, or an apparent prominence of the iliac crest—a growing out of the shoulder or of the hip, as it is popularly termed. In slight cases there may be little or no lateral deviation of the apices of the spinous pro- cesses, and the little there is may be made to disappear on suspending the patient or placing her in the prone position. In the severer cases, however, the signs are unmistakable. Thus, in the more common forms, there is usually a dorsal

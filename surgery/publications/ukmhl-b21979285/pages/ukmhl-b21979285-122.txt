106 GENERAL PATHOLOGY OF INJURIES. sebaceous glands, hair-follicles, papillae and lymphatics, are not formed. The cicatrix, at first red from the abundance of the capillaries in the granulation-tissue, becomes pale as these are obliterated by the contraction of the fibrous tissue into which the granulation-tissue is converted, and though, in the course of time, in conse- quence of the fibrous contraction, it becomes smaller, a permanent scar will remain. In wounds attended with loss of substance, in which healing by the second intention is the normal process, a traumatic inflammation is set up in the tissues imme- diately adj acent to the surface of the wound, and the Fig. 23.—Diagram of a granulating wound, conditions for healing being otherwise favourable, a coagulable material, as described above, is formed over the surface, and the serum drains away. Loops of new capillaries, derived from the old, spring up amongst the cells replacing the coagulable exudation and softened adjacent tissues, and the wound heals and cicatrizes as has just been described. Where there is much laceration or contusion of the surface of the wound, the dead tissues are cast o:ff by ulceration in the way mentioned under gangrene. 3. Healing hy the third intention,—When the two layers of granulations covering the flaps of the wound are placed and kept in contact, the capillaries in the one layer meet with those in the other, and so establish a vascular con- nection between the two flaps, and the healing of the wound then proceeds in the way described under union by the first intention. 4. Healing under a scah.—The minute changes of healing under a scab require no special description.

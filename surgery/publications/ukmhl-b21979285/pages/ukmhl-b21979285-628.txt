The stomach, as near the cardiac end as possible, is now stitched to the parietes by a double ring of sutures, so as to ensure a good inch of the stomach-wall (that between the outer and inner ring of sutures) being in contact with the parietal peritoneum (Fig. 232). The Fig. 232.â€”Howse's method of suture in gastrostoray. outer ring of sutures is passed first, by carrying the needle, armed with a silk suture, through the serous and muscular coat of the stomach, and then through the abdominal parietes a good inch from the edge of the wound. The needle is now unthreaded and withdrawn, re-threaded with the stomach end of the suture, and passed through the abdominal parietes, unthreaded, and finally withdrawn. "When all the sutures are in situ they are tied over a quill. The inner ring of sutures are then passed through the serous and muscular coat of the stomach and the skin and peritoneum only of the parietes, and tied. The wound is dressed antiseptically. 2. At the end of from four to six days the stomach will gene- rally be found adherent, and should then be punctured with a long sharp tenotomy knife, while it is drawn well forwards by the silk ligatures left in for the purpose. A No. 6 or 8 English catheter is passed through the puncture, and the wound again dressed antiseptically, the catheter passing through the antiseptic dressings. At

4 GENERAL PATHOLOGY OF SURGICAL DISEASES. place and stasis is not soon relieved, coagulation of the serum rapidly ensues, and the vessels become thrombosed. At the same time, moreover, coagulation of the liquid exudation in the tissues also occurs, in consequence, it is said, of the fibrin ferment contained in the leucocytes causing the fibrinogen in the liquid to unite with the fibrinoplastin in the leucocytes. The clot thas formed contracts, squeezing out the serum, which is then drained Fig. 1.â€”Diagram of the minute changes in inflammation. away by the lymphatics, so that if the parts at this stage be cut into, a serous exudation will no longer escape. The original tissues, partly in consequence of the plugging of the vessels, and partly in consequence of the digestive action of the leucocytes and soddening effect of the fluid exudation, become swollen and softened, and finally lose their vitality and disappear, their place being taken by a mass of closely-packed small cells embedded in a very slight amount of intercellular substance. This small- cell-infiltration was formerly thought to be derived entirely from the multiplication of the original tissue elements. More recently it has been attributed to the aggregation of the escaped leucocytes, the tissue elements being believed to remain passive or to undergo degcnera-

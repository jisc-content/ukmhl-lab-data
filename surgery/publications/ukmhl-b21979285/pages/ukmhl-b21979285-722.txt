Symptoms.—In infancy, the hernia, which is known by nurses as "starting of the navel," consists of a protru- sion at the umbilicus, readily returning when gentle pres- sure is applied, and when once seen can hardly be mistaken for any other affection. It generally undergoes a spon- taneous cure. In adults it forms a globular, lobulated, or sometimes pyriform swelling, on the lower part of which the cicatrix of the navel is seen. It often attains a large size, nearly always ex- tending as it enlarges down- wards towards the pubes, and is frequently in part or completely irreducible. It is very liable to become ob- structed and less often stran- gulated. Treatment,—In infants the hernia generally undergoes a spontaneous cure, bat a pad, consisting of a piece of cork between two layers of lint, may be applied over it, and fixed with strapping or an india-rubber bandage. In adults, an umbilical truss or bandage is necessary, or when the hernia is irreduci- ble, a hollow supporting truss. When the hernia is incarcerated, the patient must be placed at rest and an enema administered. When strangulated, an operation must be performed. The incision should then be made vertically over the swelling in the middle line, and the stricture divided in an upward direction. If the hernia cannot then be reduced, the sac must be opened, in doing which great care is necessary, as the coverings are often very thin. If the omentum presents first, as is usually the case, search must be made for the intestine, and the latter returned; the omentum must then be unravelled, transfixed with a double ligature, tied, cut off, and the stump also returned. The sac should then be cut off with the redundant skin and Fig. 27-3.—Umbihcal hernia, showing the attenuated condition of its covering. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.)

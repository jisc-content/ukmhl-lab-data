URUsTARY CALCULI. 737 the urea into carbonate of ammonia, which converts the soluble acid into insoluble alkaline phosphates. Carbonate of lime, cystic oxide, and uric oxide, are too rare to require description. B. The organized deposits.—To these belong pus, blood, mucus, epithelium, renal casts, spermatozoa, and fungi. Pus occurs as a thick sediment and may be recognised by the urine containing albumen, and by the microscopical appearance of the pus-corpuscles (p. 25). It may be due to cystitis, pyelitis, gonorrhoea, leucorrhoea, and abscess Fig. 284.—Phosphates of ammonia and magnesia (triple phosphates). (Bryant's Surgery.) in any part of the urinary tract. Urine containing mucus becomes gelatinous and ropy on adding liquor, potassrje. Blood may be recognized by the urine being smoky or red, by the ozonic ether test, and by the microscope. See Hoematuria (p. 762). Epithelium, renal casts, spermatozoa, and fungi may be detected by the microscope. Urinae-Y calculi are commonly spoken of as renal ,- vesical and prostatic, according as they occur in the kidney, bladder or prostate. Renal calculi are formed in the kidney and have already been described (p. 728). Prostatic calculi are formed in the racemose glands of the prostate, and will be further referred to under diseases of that organ (p. 767). Vesical calculi may originate in the bladder, or, as is more commonly the case, in the kidney, w. 3 b

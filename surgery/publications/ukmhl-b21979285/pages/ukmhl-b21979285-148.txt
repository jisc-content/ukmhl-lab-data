The reef-knot versus B, the granny-knot. E Ml cut through the external coat. Eecently Messrs. Ballance and Edmunds, as the result of an experimental enquiry on the ligature of the larger arteries in their continuity, have advocated that two ligatures should be applied so as merely to occlude the lumen of the vessel, without dividing the internal and middle coats. These observations, however, can hardly apply to the liga- ture of the cut end of arteries in wounds, as unless the ligature is ap- plied tightly to such there is, obviously, danger of its slipping. An artery is tied in an open wound by seizing the cut end with nibbed forceps (of which Fig. 30 is one of the best forms), drawing it gently from its sheath, throwing a liga- ture round it, and then tying the liga - ture in a reef-knot (Fig. 31, a). Both ends of the ligature are then cut off short. JE^^ts vf liguture.—"When a ligature is properly applied the intemaL^nd middle coats are evenly and trans- versely cut through by its pressure. Their cut edges retracVahd curve within the canal of the vessel, and the external coat, crumpled ujd and tightly embraced by the ligature, retains the two inner coats in contact with each other (Fig. 32).

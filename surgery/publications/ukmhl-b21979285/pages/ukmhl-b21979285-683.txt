Eeduction may possibly be aided by insufflation of the j rectum with air or hydrogen. If adhesions have formed try to break them down by gently insinuating a probe between the contiguous serous surfaces. After reduction search for any rent in the peritoneal coat and bring it to- gether by suture and seal with an omental graft. Beduction failing, the following courses are open. 1. Exclusion of I the intussusception by leaving it in situ and short circuit- ing the intestine (Fig. 254) by forming a communication between the bowel above and below the intussusception by means of Senn's approximation method, 2.

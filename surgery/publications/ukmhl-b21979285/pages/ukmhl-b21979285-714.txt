The infardile hernia is one in which the intestine, enclosed in its sac, descends behind the funicular process of the tunica vaginalis, which has remained unobliterated but is cut off by a septum at the internal abdominal ring from the general peritoneal cavity. Should an operation become necessary, three layers of peritoneum have to be cut through, viz., the anterior layer of the unobliterated funicular process of the tu- nica vaginalis; the posterior layer of the same; and finally the true sac.

Before escaping at the ex- ternal abdominal ring it either passes through or under the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and trans- versalis, which is situated immediately behind the external abdominal ring; or it protrudes that structure in front of it. The coverings from without inwards are, 1, skin;

PRESSUEE-TREATMENT OF ANEURYSM. 301 of compressors and tourniquets which have been invented for the purpose (Figs. 83, 84, and 85). It is better when possible to apply the pressure to one artery, though slightly varying its position, than to change from one artery to another, as from the superficial to the common femoral, since by so doing different sets of anastomosing arteries are enlarged, and the collateral circulation may become too free. Cases unsuitable for pressure.—1. Where the aneurysm is of very large size, or is rapidly increasing. 2. Where the sac is thin, contains but little fibrin, and appears Fig. 83.—DeCarte's Fig. 84.—Lister'sab- Fig. 85.—Skey's Tourniquet. dominal Tourniquet. Tourniquet. likely soon to burst. 3. Where there is much oedema from venous obstruction. 4. Where the patient is of an irritable disposition, is intolerant of pain, or has been addicted to the abuse of alcohol. It is considered by some that even if pressure fails good may have been done by causing a deposit of fibrin in the sac, and by enlarging the collateral vessels. By others these advantages are thought to be outweighed by the irritation and disappoint- ment to the patient of failure, and the bruising and injury of the tissues at the situation where the artery will have to be tied. (c.) Pressure by EsmarcJi's bandage {Reid^s method) aims at simultaneously compressing the artery above and below the aneurysm, and thus causing the blood contained in both the aneurysm and the artery to coagulate.

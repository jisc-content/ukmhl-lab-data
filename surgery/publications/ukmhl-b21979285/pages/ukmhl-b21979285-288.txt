272 DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES. tuberculous disease, ankylosis and caries may often be observed at the same time. The signs of ankylosis are obvious—?*.e., the joint is stiff. It only remains to diagnose the fibrous from the bony. Ill the former there is slight movement, and generally pain; in the latter neither movement nor pain. In some instances, however, as in ankylosis of the shoulder and hip, it may be necessary to place the patient under an anaesthetic, as the joint may be held so firmly by the contraction of the muscles that the fibrous may simulate the bony form, and again, although bony ankylosis may exist, the revolving of the scapula and pelvis on the trunk may make it appear that there is some movement in the affected joint. The treatment will vary with the nature of the anky- losis. In the spurious form something may often be done by dividing the cicatrices, or by freeing the parts by a plastic operation, though in such cases the treatment is seldom very hopeful. In the fibrous form an attempt should be made to restore the natural movements of the joints— (1) by manipulation, friction, and passive movements; (2) by forcibly breaking down the adhesions under an anaesthetic, at the same time dividing any tendons that may offer resistance; or (3) by gradual extension by a weight and pulley, or some form of cog- wheel or screw apparatus. An attempt to break down adhesions, however, should on no account be made whilst any signs of inflammation remain, and after the opera- tion the limb should be placed on a splint for a iew days, and cold by means of Leiter's tubes or an ice-bag applied to prevent inflammation. Bony ankylosis, with the limb in a good position, is often the best result that can be hoped for after the disease of the joint has reached a certain stage. But in some instances an operation may be required to restore movement, or to rectify a faulty Fig. 76.—Bony ankylosis of the hip. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.)

291 ANEURYSM. 4. By the giving way of the external and middle coats, and the protrusion of the internal coat through them (very rare); and 5. By the giving way of the internal and part of the middle coats, and extravasation of the blood be- tween the layers of the middle coat. Structure of an aneurysm,—An aneurysm consists of a sac and its contents. The sac may consist—(1) of all the coats of the artery, Fig. 79, A and B; (2) of the external coat only, Fig. 79, c; (3) of condensed tissues external to the artery, Eig. 79, r ; (1) of the internal coat only (very rare), Fig. 79, D ; (5) of the separated layers of the middle coat, between which the blood has been forced, with the external and internal coats on either side (dis- secting aneurysm). Fig. 79, E. The practical point. I ^ A B C D E F Fig. 79.—Diao-rani illustrating the structure of an aneurysm. however, to be borne in mind, is that it is only whilst the aneurysm is small, and then by dissection alone, that these distinctions can be made ; and that as the aneurysm increases in size the tissues around become condensed and blended with the sac, which may finally be formed almost or entirely of these tissues. The contents of the sac.— When an aneurysm is first formed, the sac contains only fluid blood; fibrin, however, is gradually deposited from the blood in concentric layers upon the internal surface of the sac, so that after it has existed some time, the contents are partly solid laminated fibrin, and partly coao:u1ated and fluid blood. Next the wall of the sac the fibrin is laminated, firm and compressed, and of a yellowish-white colour; but towards the mouth of the sac it becomes softer and moister, and of a reddish colour: whil>?t that in contact with the fluid blood merely resembles ordinary blood coagulum. In an aneurysm that has been cured, the whole sac will generally be found thus filled with laminated clot, which has been aptly likened to the u 2

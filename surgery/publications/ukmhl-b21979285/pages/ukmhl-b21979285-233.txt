217 rOREIGN BODIES m NERVES. be mentioned crutcli-palsy due to the pressure of a crutch, upon the large nerves in the axilla; the dropped wrist from the involvement of the musculo-spiral nerve in the callus in fracture of the humerus; the tingling, nu;iiibness and partial paralysis sometimes following dis- locations of the shoulder from the pressure of the head of the displaced bone on the brachial plexus; the pain caused by the pressure of a tumour on a nerve; the '' pins and needles " felt in the feet after sitting on the edge of a chair from compression of the sciatic nerve, &c. The treatment consists in releasing, if practicable, the nerve from the compressing agent. If a wound of the soft tissues is necessary to accomplish this object, healing with- out suppuration should be obtained, if possible, as other- wise the nerve may become again compressed by the re- sulting scar-tissue. Contusions of nerves.—A familiar example of this injury is a blow on the ulnar nerve, as it lies behind the internal condyle. There is intense pain at the spot struck, and shooting pains and " pins and needles " in the parts supplied by the nerve. These symptoms pass off shortly, but occasionally they may be more severe and last for several weeks, in which case there is probably some effu- sion of blood in the nerve. In rare instances ascending neuritis, persistent neuralgia, or even paralysis, and changes similar to those observed after complete division of a nerve, may follow. Foreign bodies in nerves.—A portion of a needle broken off in a nerve, the lodgment of small shot from a gun accident, &c., may give rise to inflammation of the nerve, persistent irritation and pain at the inj ured spot, spasm in the muscles, and pain or tingling in the parts supplied by the nerve. Such accidents have occasionally been followed by epileptiform convulsions. The treatment is to cut down upon and remove the foreign body.

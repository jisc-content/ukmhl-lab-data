ABSCESS m BONE. 235 termination of diffuse osteo-myelitis and periostitis. Cir- cumscribed suppuration or abscess is generally of the chronic variety, and, as already stated, is one of the terminations of chronic osteitis. Chronic abscess in hone is most common in the cancellous ends of the long bones, especially the upper and lower end of the tibia and lower end of the femur, but is occasionally met with in other bones. The causes especially leading to the termination of osteitis in abscess are thought to be the presence of Tig. 57.—Abscess in end of tibia. The pyogenic mem- brane is well seen.

Pathology.—In the course of rarefying osteitis the bone- tTabeculse are gradually destroyed, and their place is taken by a small-cell-exudation, which now assumes the form of granulation-tissue. This in the focus of the inflamed spot softens and breaks down into pus, whilst that around the centrally-softened spot constitutes the abscess-wall, and forms to the naked eye a distinct membrane (Fig. 57) lining the bony cavity {pyogenic membrane). The bone around the abscess generally becomes sclerosed owing to

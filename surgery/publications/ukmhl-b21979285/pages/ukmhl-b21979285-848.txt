The pedicle, which consists of broad ligament and its contained structures, is trans- fixed and ligatured as in ovariotomy, the ovary cut off, and the pedicle dropped back into the abdomen. Hysterectomy, or removal oe the uterus, may be done through the vagina {Schrceder^s operation) or through an incision in the abdominal walls {FreuncVs operation). In the former, an incision is made through the vaginal mucous membrane around the cervix, the peritoneal cavity opened, the broad ligament transfixed and liga- tured, and the uterus severed from its connections and drawn out through the vagina. In the operation though the abdominal wall, the peritoneal cavity is opened, as in ovariotomy; the broad ligament transfixed and ligatured ; and the uterus drawn up from the pelvis and carefully severed from its connections. For a detailed account of these operations, however, the student is referred to a larger work. DISEASES OE THE BREAST.

A considerable proportion of cases develop carci- noma of the breast.

The pain is often severe, per- haps shooting down the arm, and may be constant or periodic; whilst the skin over the breast, as well as the gland itself, is exceedingly sensitive onhandling.

No local treat- ment is necessary; indeed, the patient's attention should be taken off the breast as much as possible. Inflammation of the breast may occur at any age, and in the male as well as in the female. In infants it is

FEMORAL HERNIA. 703 at the saphenous opening, at Gimbernat's ligament, or more rarely at the deep crural arch. Signs (Fig. 272).—A femoral hernia usually appears as a tense globular swelling at the upper and inner part of the thigh, just below Poupart's ligament internal to the Fia. 271.—Femoral hernia. The coverings dissected off to show the sac. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) Fig. 272.—Femoral hernia, with line of incision. femoral vessels, and external to the spine of the pubes. It is usually small, but may sometimes be as large as an orange, or even larger. It then extends upwards and outwards over Poupart's ligament towards the iliac spine, and appears as an elongated soft and yielding swelling with its long axis parallel to the ligament. Its neck, however, can always be traced below the ligament towards the femoral ring. The characteristic signs of hernia are, of course, present.

436 INJURIES OF REGIOInTS. the head and face from pressure on the trachea, oeso- phagus, or veins of the neck. Treatment—The forward and the backward dislocations can generally be readily reduced by simply drawing back the shoulders, the knee, if necessary, being placed between the scapulae. In the forward variety, indeed, I have always found the end of the clavicle sink into its place on laying the patient on his back. Eeduction of the backward variety has at times been impossible, and excision of the end of the bone has been necessary for the relief of the severe dyspnoea which it has caused by its pressure on the trachea. The upward dislocation may be reduced by Fig. 125.—Dislocation of the sternal end of the clavicle forwards. (Bryant's Surgery.) placing a pad in the axilla to act as a fulcrum and pressing the arm to the side, thus drawing the clavicle outwards. Direct pressure should at the same time be applied to the displaced end. All forms are difficult to retain in position. The best plan, perhaps, is to keep the patient constantly on his back for three weeks. If, how- ever, he will not consent to this restraint, an endeavour may be made to retain the parts in as good a position as possible by one of the many methods of bandaging described in the larger text-books. I do not mention any here, as I have never seen any of them of any avail. II. The acromial end may be dislocated either, 1, upwards; or, 2, downwards. Both forms are rare, but the upward is the least so. These injuries are sometimes spoken of as dislocations of the scapula. Cause.— Commonly direct violence applied to the acromion. The signs are usually obvious. There is apparent lengthening of the arm with depression and slight flattening of the

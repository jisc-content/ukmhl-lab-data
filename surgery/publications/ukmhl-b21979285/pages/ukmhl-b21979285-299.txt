A purge at the onset is generally required, and opium is usually needed to relieve the pain. The patient at first should be confined to a slop diet, but later a stimulating plan of treatment is commonly called for. Should any stiffness of the part remain after the inflammation has subsided, an attempt should be made to overcome it by passive movements, massage, &c. Dead bone must be removed when loose, and amputation of the affected finger, or even, in severe cases, of the forearm, may become necessary. DISEASES OF FASCIA. Dupuyteen's contraction of the palmar fascia is the only affection of the fasciae requiring notice. It has been attributed to gout and rheu- matism, and to habits or occu- pations necessitating pressure in the palm, or flexion of the fingers. It is probably of the nature of a chronic inflamma- tion, secondary, according to Mr. Anderson, to inoculation of the subcutaneous connective tissue with a specific germ which he suggests might gain admission by a scratch of the palm by the finger-nail. The affection consists in a shortening of the prolongations of the fascia from the palm on to the sheath of the flexor ten- dons. The tendons themselves are not affected. The contraction generally begins in the fascia of the little or ring finger as a small rounded fibrous nodule, and always at a point where a wound from the nail with the finger clenched might occur, and later may affect that of the middle finger, and at times the fore- finger and also the thumb. The affected fingers (Fig, 77) are drawn by tense bands towards the palm, and in severe Fig. 77. â€” Dupuytren's contraction of the pal- mar fascia.

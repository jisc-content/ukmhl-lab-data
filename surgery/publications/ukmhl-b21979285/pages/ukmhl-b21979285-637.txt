A little below the thyroid cartilage the cricoid can be felt. It is situated opposite the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra and is an excellent landmark, as it can always be dis- tinguished however fat the neck. Between it and the thyroid cartilage is the erico-thyroid membrane, which is quite superficial being covered only by the skin, super- ficial and deep fascia, and the overlapping sterno-hyoid Fig. 238.â€”Situation of incisions for operations in middle line of neck. a.

The lines only show the relative situation of the incisions, not their correct length. muscles. This is the spot where laryngotomy is performed (Fig. 238, c). Below the cricoid cartilage are two or three rings of the trachea, and then the thyroid isthmus. There is usually a space between the cricoid cartilage and the isthmus of a quarter to half an inch. Here the trachea is merely covered by the skin, superficial and deep fascia, and the overlapping sterno-hyoid muscles on either side, and it is in this situation that tracheotomy is best performed (Fig. .238, d). When the incision is extended upwards through the cricoid as well as through the upper rings of the trachea, it is called laryngo-tracheo- toray. After the isthmus of the thyroid gland, which, in adults, is usually about half an inch wide, follow four or

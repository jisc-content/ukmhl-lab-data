697 INGUINAL HERNIA. diagrams. The following are those most commonly de- scribed :— 1. The common or acquired form {the inguino-scrotal of Birkett). The sac here consists simply of a protrusion of peritoneum through the inguinal canal, and the hernia ■when complete may descend into the scrotum or labium. The testicle can always be felt either below, or below and behind the hernia (Fig. 264). 2. The congenital. In this form the hernia descends into the funicular process of the peritoneum, which has remained open, and comes into contact with the testicle, the funicular process and tunica yaginalis of course forming the sac. The testis is more or less surrounded by the hernia, instead of being felt distinctly behind and below it, as in the former variety (Eigs. 265 and 266).

The hernia into the fimicular process resembles the congenital, in that the hernia descends into the funicular process of the tunica vaginalis, but differs in that it does not reach the testicle, being cut off from it by a septum at the epididymis. Should an operation be required in this form, the testicle is not seen as in the congenital. 4. The encysted congenital (Fig. 267). In this form the funicular process of the tunica vaginalis is cut off from the peritoneal cavity by a septum at the internal ring. The septum yields to the pressure of the hernia, and be- comes invaginated before it into the unobliterated funi- cular process. Should an operation be necessary, the anterior layer of the funicular process, and the elongated septum forming the spurious sac, will have to be cut s

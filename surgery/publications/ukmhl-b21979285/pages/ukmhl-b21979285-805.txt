STONE IN THE URETHRA, '789 remain localized, giving rise to a hard circumscribed swelling in the perineum, which may slowly make its way towards the scrotum; and lastly, when the extrava- sation occurs behind the posterior layer of the triangular ligament and the urine is extravasated into the pelvic cellular tissue, the symptoms resemble those of extraperi- toneal rupture of the bladder. Treatment.—A catheter should be passed into the bladder, or where this is impossible, down to the stricture, and in either case a free incision in the middle line of the perineum extending into the urethra made on the cathe- ter. Eree incisions through the skin of the scrotum, penis, and groins, in fact wherever the urine has pene- trated, should likewise be made to allow of it draining away, and the wounds rendered as far as possible aseptic by the free application of iodoform or other antiseptics. The patient's strength at the same time must be sup- ported by fluid nourishment and stimulants; whilst opium should be given, unless contra-indicated on account of kidney disease. Stone in the urethra.—A small calculus or frag- ment of one may become impacted in any part of the urethra, but most frequently in the membraneous portion (Fig. 308), or just within the meatus. When sharp and .angular it causes much pain, and when large enough to Fia. 308.—Calculus hupacted in urethra. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.)

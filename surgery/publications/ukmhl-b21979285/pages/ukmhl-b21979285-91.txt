TUMOURS. 75 growing about the scrotum or labium; doughy, non elastic, moveable, pendulous, and fleshy when occurring as wens. Treatment.—When practicable they should be removed. LiPOMATA OR FATTY TUMOURS are composed of fat like that normally found in the body. They are innocent, and grow slowly, but may attain a large size, and do not return on removal. They are most comnion in adult life. Structure,—They consist of masses of fat bound to- gether by delicate connective tissue and blood-vessels, and are surrounded as a rule by a thin capsule, which is Fia. 9.—Fatty tumour. attached by fibrous septa to the skin. The microscopical characters are seen in Fig. 9. Secondary changes.—Mucoid softening, inflammation with adhesion from pressure, and, very occasionally, ulceration and calcification. Usual seats.—They are most common on the shoulders, back, and nates, where they have been attributed to irritation or pressure, as by the braces, the sitting pos- ture, &c. Signs and diagnosis.—They form circumscribed, lobu- lated, semi-fluctuating, painless, soft, inelastic tumours, generally single, but occasionally multiple. They may be distinguished from a chronic abscess, a bursa or a cyst, the swellings for which they are perhaps most likely to be mistaken, by the edge slipping from under the fingers when the side of the tumour is pressed upon, by the dimpling of the skin when pinched up between the thumb and fingers, and by the non-escape of fluid on puncture with a grooved needle. They sometimes, when gravity favours it, shift their site by slipping down in the connec- tive tissue. This is most common in the spermatic cord, a

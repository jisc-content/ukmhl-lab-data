619 TUMOURS OF THE LABYNX. common, and occur as small, smooth, solitary, spherical, pedunculated or sessile growths, springing from the vocal cords. The ejpitlieliomata usually grow from the mucous membrane covering the arytenoid cartilages, or from the ventricular bands or cords. A sarcomatous tumour is shown in the accompanying illustration (Fig. 237). The chief sym,ptoms of a growth in the larynx are hoarseness or aphonia, and dyspnoea. When the growth Fig. 236.—Papilloma of larynx. Fia. 237.—Sarcoma of larynx. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) Museum.) is pedunculated the symptoms are often paroxysmal and intermittent in character, in consequence of the growth being moved by the current of air in respiration. The laryngoscope is essential for the diagnosis. In the early stages it may be difficult to distinguish an innocent from- a malignant tumour, but if a small piece can be removed, a microscopical examination will usually clear up the point. Later, the rapid growth of the tumour, its ten- dency to ulcerate, its induration, its involvement of surrounding parts, the enlargement of lymphatic glands, and the accompanying pain and cachexia will indicate malignancy. Frequently, however, the lymphatic glands are not involved, and there may be no cachexia.

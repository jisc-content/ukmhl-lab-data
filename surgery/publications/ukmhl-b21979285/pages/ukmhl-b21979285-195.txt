TREATMENT OF PRACTURES. 179 Thus, in fracture of the fore-arm or leg, extension should be made from the hand or foot respectively, whilst counter-extension is applied at the same time to the upper fragment, also preferably through the joint above. Whilst steady traction is thus being made, the Surgeon should gently manipulate the fragments, and he should not ,:^est satisfied till the symmetry of the part has been as far as pos- sible restored, and the limb is found, both on inspection and measurement, to correspond as near as may be with the opposite side. In this position the parts should be held till the apparatus for permanently fixing them has been applied. Where great diffi- culty is experienced in reducing the fracture owing to muscular spasm, the limb should be flexed or placed in such a position as will tend to relax the opposing muscles, or if this does not suffice an anaesthetic may be adminis- tered. At times the subcutaneous division of a tendon may become necessary before the fracture can be reduced. In some impacted ^^^^ 40.-Fracture of the Femur with overlapping fragments to show round- ing off of angles, and re- storation of medullary canal by absorption of intervening bone. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) fractures, as of the neck of thehu merus or femur, it may be advis- able not to disturb the fragments, as by so doing non-union, a worse condition than impaction, may result. The special methods of reduction which may be required for certain fractures will be given und^r Varieties of Fracture. 2. To keep the fragments in apposition till union has taken place, numerous contrivances have been invented. They may be said to consist of splints, cradles, fracture- boxes, bandages hardened by plaster of Paris, silica, paraffin, glue, or gum and chalk, and such material as gutta-percha, poroplastic felt, and leather, moulded to the individual case. The method of applying splints will be better learnt by three months' dressing in the wards N 2

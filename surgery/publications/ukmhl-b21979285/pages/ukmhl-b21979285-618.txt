Abscesses of the septum are not very common. They may be due to injury or the breaking down of gummata, but occasionally occur without any apparent cause. When Fig. 221.—Author's forcej)s for Fig. 222.—Retentive apparatus straightening nasal septum. for deflected septum. acute they may lead to perforation of the septum. The parts are hot, red, and swollen, and fluctuation may soon be detected. A free and early incision should be made. Gummata of the septum occasionally form beneath the perichondrium in the course of syphilis. They are readily dispersed with iodide of potassium, but if neglected may Fig. 223.—Nasal plugs.

Deflection of the septum to one or other side may occur as the result of an injury, or as a congenital malforma- tion. It appears as a swelling projecting into and ob- structing one of the nasal cavities, whilst in the other cavity a corresponding depression is seen. The inferior turbinated bone on the side of the concavity is often much hypertrophied. The deflection is generally attended with some lateral deviation or even depression of the

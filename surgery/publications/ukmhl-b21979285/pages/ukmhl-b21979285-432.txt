416 INJURIES OF REGIONS. Method of uniting wounded intestine,—If the wound is small (a mere puncture) it has usually been taught that no suture will be required, since the mucous membrane will protrude, block up the wound, and prevent extra- vasation until the wound has healed by inflammatory exudation from the peiitoneal surface. Gross's experi- ments on dogs show, however, that the protrusion of mucous membrane is not always sufficient even in minute wounds to prevent the escape of faecal matter. It would, therefore, appear to be the better practice in all cases to sew up the wound, however small. This is now usually Fig. lis.—Section of intestine united by Lembert's suture.

The sutures are best applied by Lembert's method, as shown in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 113), in which it is seen that the suture passes through the peritoneal and muscular coats only, avoiding the mucous membrane, since ii this is included there is danger of peritonitis from leakage along the thread. The sutures, which may cons'st of fine aseptic China silk, should be introduced about two lines from the edge of the wound and brought out at the margin of the serous coat, and then passed in the same manner on the opposite side (Fig. 114). If, however, the edges are lacerated the sutures should be introduced further from the wound, and brought out a good line from the margin, so as not to include the bruised tissues. Sufficient sutures should be passed to ensure the parts being everywhere in appo- sition, and should not be tied too tightly, lest gangrene, the commonest cause of non-union, ensue. The peri-

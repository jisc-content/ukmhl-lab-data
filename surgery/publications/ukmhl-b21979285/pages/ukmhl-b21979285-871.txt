855 TREATMENT OF TALIPES. {hollow claio-foot). This condition is frequently due to infantile paralysis affecting the interosseous muscles. General treatment of talipes.—The indications are—1, to restore the deformed foot to its natural position ; and 2, to retain it in this position until the normal func- tions of the joints and muscles have been so far restored that there is no tendency to a relapse. In the congenital and in many of the acquired forms these indications can be successfully fulfilled if appropriate means are taken and sufficient time and care are given to the case. But in the paralytic varieties, where the muscles have under- gone complete atrophy and degeneration, these, of course, cannot be restored, and the foot can only be maintained in the normal position by the use of instruments. Por the fulfilling of the first indication both operative and mechanical or manipulative treatment may be necessary. For the second, the use of mechanical supports and physio- logical after-treatment should be employed. The operative treatment, when this is necessary, will generally consist in the subcutaneous division of certain tendons (tenotomy), in the division of contracted liga- ments {syndesmotomy), and in inveterate cases in the ex- cision or section of some of the tarsal bones [tarsectomy or tarsotomy). Tenotom,y is indicated where there is much rigidity and the foot cannot be brought into its natural position by manipulation. Its object is the lengthening of the shortened tendon, not its mere division. The lengthening is effected by the organization of the small-cell-exudation Fig. 330.—TaUpes valgus or flat-foot.

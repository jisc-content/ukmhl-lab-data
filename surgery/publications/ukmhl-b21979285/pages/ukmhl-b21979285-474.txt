INJITRIES OF IIEGIOKS. 458 month, to five or six weeks. The fingers and fore-arm may often with advantage be bandaged to prevent oedema. 3. The lower end of the humerus. — Fractures in this situation may be divided into (a) transverse fracture; (b) separation of the epiphysis; (c) T-shaped fracture; (d) fracture of the condyles. Of these, the transverse when above the condyles, the separation of the epiphysis, and the fracture of the tip of the internal con- dyle, are extra-capsular; the others involve the joint. Cause.—All varieties are generally the result of direct violence, such as falls upon the bent elbow, (a) The transverse fracture may be above or below the condyles; in the former case it is extra-, in the latter in- tracapsular. Nature of the displacement. — The lower fragment, together with the bones of the forearm, are drawn backwards and up- wards behind the upper frag- ment by the triceps, whilst the lower end of the upper fragment projects in front of the joint (Fig. 142). Signs.— The forearm is shortened and generally bent more or less at a right angle to the arm; the olecranon projects pos- teriorly; and the lower end of the upper fragment forms a prominence in front of the joint. The signs are similar to those of dislocation of the radius and ulna backwards. The following differences presented by the two injuries should serve to distinguish them; although when not seen immediately after the accident the condition of the parts may be so obscured by swelling that an accurate diagnosis cannot be made till the inflammation has sub- sided. Thus, in fracture—1, the deformity is readily reduced, but reappears on removing the extending force; 2, crepitus is obtained on reduction; 3, the condyles bear normal relations to the olecranon ; 4, the distance between the acromion and external condyle is less than on the sound side; 5, the prominent lower end of the upper Fig. 142. — Fracture of the lower end of the humerus.

SEPARATION OE THE EPIPHYSIS OE THE HEAD, are too rare to call for description here. II. Fractures of the shaet oe the eemur are very common in children, less common in adults, and rare in old people, in whom intra- and extracapsular fractures more readily occur. Cause.—Generally the re- sult of indirect violence, occasionally of direct, and rarely of muscular action. State of the parts,—The Kne of fracture is usually transverse or oblique; but in rare instances, Fia. 161.—Fracture of upper third of femur. (After Gfray.) Fig. 162.—Fracture of lower third of femur. (After Grray.) almost longitudinal or spiral. The oblique is more com- mon in adults ; the transverse in children. The fragments for the most part considerably overlap, producing much shortening. The usual situation of the fracture is about the middle of the bone, though it may occur through the upper or middle or lower third. In the upper third (Fig. 161), the lower end of the upper fragment is drawn forwards by the psoas and iliacus, and at the same time,

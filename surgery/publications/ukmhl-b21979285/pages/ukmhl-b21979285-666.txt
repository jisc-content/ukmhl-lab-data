650 DISEASES OF REGIONS. sac some of tlie large nerve-cords given o& from it run forwards across the interior of the sac to re-enter the spinal canal. Hence those nerves that are given off from the cord where it is adherent to the sac-wall, appear to arise from the sac, and were in former times wrongly described as being distributed to it (see Fig. 249). 3. In the syringo-myelocele (Fig. 250), the most rare form, the central canal of the cord is greatly distended with fluid. Fig. 248.—Spinal meningocele. Fia. 249.—Meningo-mjelocele. In the three. diagrams (Figs. 248, 249, and 250) the letters have the same reference, a. Dura mater, b. Parietal, and c. visceral arachnoid, d. Pia mater, e. Cord. the expanded cord being thus spread out over the sac- wall, with which it is intimately blended. The nerves in this case pass through the walls of the sac to their destination. The coverings of the sac may be healthy skin ; but more commonly normal skin is only found at the sides, the central portion consisting of a thin bluish membrane. Sometimes a slight depression is seen on the lower part of the sac at the spot where the cord terminates in the wall. This is called the umhilicus, and at its bottom the central canal of the cord has at times been seen to open. In rare instances there has been no protrusion, but

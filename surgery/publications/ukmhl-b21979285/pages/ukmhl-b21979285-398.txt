INJIJEIES OF EEGIONS. 382 througli the angle may be detected by crepitus and by slight mobility of the fragments on firmly grasping the ascending ramus and body of the jaw. Fracture through the neck may be known by the peculiar displace- ment before alluded to, and perhaps, by crepitus on manipulation. Treatment,—The parts should be placed in apposition and kept at perfect rest. This can usually be done by a gutta-percha splint moulded to the chin (Fig. 103), and secured by a four-tailed bandage (Fig. 106). All movements of the jaw must be avoided, the patient being fed on slops introduced either behind the last molar tooth or through any space left available by the loss of a Fig. 103.—Grutfca-percha splint for fractured jaw.

In placing the parts in apposition some difficulty may be experienced in consequence of a displaced tooth having slipped between the fragments. If the parts can- not be kept in place by the simple splint above mentioned, they must be secured either by drilling the fragments and wiring them together, or by means of the dental splint shown in the accompanying drawing (Fig. 104). This splint consists of a wire frame fitted round the back and front of the teeth, and further secured by transverse wires between the teeth. One of the more elaborate, so- called interdental splints, may at times be found neces- sary. Union is usually accomplished in four or five weeks. Dislocation of the lower jaw.—This accident may sometimes result from a fall or blow upon the chin with the mouth open, but more frequently occurs from spas- modic action of the external pterygoid muscles during yawning. When both condyles are displaced the disloca-

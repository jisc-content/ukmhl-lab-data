Where extension with the heel in the axilla fails, slowly carry the arm to a right angle with the body and extend, or raise Fig. 130.—Reduction by the heel in the axilla. (Cooper's Dislocations.) it above the head, and again extend in this position. An anaesthetic should be given if necessary. 3. Extension with the pulleys, — In long-standing cases the use of the pulleys may be required. First break down any adhe- sions that may be present, by cau- tiously manipulating the arm; then fix the scapula by a well-padded leather strap passed under the axilla and se- cured to a staple in the wall. Attach the pulleys to a leather band buckled round the arm, and make steady exten- sion, manipulating the head of the bone the while. The extension, and counter-extension should always be made in the same horizontal line. This may be first in the direction of the axis of the body, then across the body, with the arm at right angles to it (Fig. 132). Occasionally success may Fig. 131.—The clove hitch.

DISEASES OF REGIONS. 654 or inverted tube, the last 'two together being further called the intussuscepted portion, or intussusceptiim. Thus there are two peritoneal and two mucous surfaces of the intestine in contact (Fig. 252), and between the inner and middle tubes is a portion of the mesentery or meso-colon, which is necessarily drawn down with the intestine. The dragging of the mesentery causes the intussusceptum to assume a greater curve than its sheath, and hence to become puckered along its concavity; it also causes the orifice of the intussusceptum to be directed towards the Fig. 251.—Intussusception. (St. Fig. 252.—Diagram of in- Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) tussusception. mesenteric attachment and to be slit-like in shape. The intussusception nearly always increases at the expense of the lower portion of the intestine, the sheath becoming more and more infolded, so that, if the intussusception occurs at the lower part of the ileum, no more of the ileum will be involved, but the caecum and colon may be gradually drawn in. More rarely, however, the ileum is protruded through the ileo-csecal valve ; the intussus- ception then increases at the expense of the upper portion of the intestine, more and more of the ileum being pro- truded through the valve'. This variety is known as the ileo-coUc in contradistinction to the former which is called the ileo-ccecal. At first the invagination is reducible, and is not attended with any serious obstruction to the lumen

DISEASES OF BEGIONS. 516 disease that patients are specially liable to the complica- tions which will be considered later. Treatment,—After attention to the general health, the most important part of the treatment is great cleanliness. If a quantity of half-dried secretion mixed with epithelial debris be found in the meatus, this should first be removed by the instilla- tion of warm bicarbonate of soda (gr. x. ad f§j.) for several nights, and then thoroughly syringing the ear. Next let the ear be syringed with warm boracic acid night and morning, and after drying the meatus, blow in powdered boracic acid. If this treatment be unsuccess- ful, then try an alcoholic solution of boracic acid ; or if this causes pain, the solution may at first be diluted with an equal quantity of water. Or sulphate of zinc (gr. x. ad fgj.), or acetate of lead (gr. iij. ad f^j.) may be tried. If the perforation be large and the mucous membrane of the tympanum much swollen it should be touched with solid nitrate of silver, or a saturated solution of chromic acid. Often when the discharge has ceased, the membrane remains perforated, and there is considerable deafness. In such cases the hearing may be greatly improved by means of an artificial membrane. "Without here discussing how the artificial membrane acts, it is sufficient to say there are two kinds, known as Yearsley's and Toynbee's. 1. Yearsley^s consists of a piece of moistened cotton-wool, rolled into an elongated plug, and applied with a pair of forceps specially designed for the purpose (Fig. 185). 2. Toynbee's consists (Fig. 186) of a disk of soft india-rubber with a piece of silver wire attached to the centre. The former has the advantage of being less irritating to the ear, and can be moistened with medicated fiuids, should any discharge still persist, but it Fia. 185.—Forceps for inserting artificial drum.

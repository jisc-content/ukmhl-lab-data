491 PUACTtrilES OF THE tATELJLA. cliaracteristic of epiphysial fractures, will point to the nature of tlie injury.- The separation of the fragments, moreover, is usually less than in other fractures in this situation, as the two surfaces are broad. Union generally occurs by bone, and hence shortening is common. Treatmerd. — Some form of the long splint may be applied; or extension made by the stirrup, weight, and pulley ; or the limb may be placed on an iron back-splint, with two side splints, and slung in the way to be described under fracture of the bones of the leg. In the supra- condyloid fracture, where the lower fragment is much tilted backwards by the gastrocnemius, the tendo Achillis Figs. 16.6 and 167.—Transverse and vertical fracture of the patella. may be divided, or the double-inclined plane used. In any case an ice-bag or lead lotion should be applied to the knee till the effusion is absorbed. Passive movements should be begun at the end of about four weeks. The patella. — Fractures of the patella are most common in middle life, of more frequent occurrence in men than in women, and very rare in childhood. Cause. —They are generally due to a sudden and violent action of the quadriceps extensor muscle, such as is exerted by a person to regain the upright position when he feels himself slipping backwards, the knee being then semi-flexed, and the patella unsupported. They are some- times caused by direct violence, as a blow or fall upon the knee. State of the parts.—When due to muscular action the line of the fracture is transverse (Fig. 166), the aponeurotic covering is usually torn, and the upper frag- ment generally drawn some distance from the lower by the action of the quadriceps extensor. When due to direct violence it is more often starred or vertical (Fig. 167), and the aponeurosis being intact, there is little or no

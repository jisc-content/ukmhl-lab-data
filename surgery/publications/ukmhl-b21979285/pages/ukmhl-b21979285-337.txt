LIGATURE OP ARTERIES. 321 r obliquely from within outwards (Fig. 90 d) and divide the semilunar fascia of the biceps; the artery will be found between the tendon of the biceps on the outer side and the median nerve on the inner side. The collateral circulation (Fig. 89) when the artery is tied above the superior profunda is like that after ligature of the third part of the axillary (p. 320). "When tied below the superior profunda it is carried on chiefly by the anastomosis of this vessel with the radial and interosseous recur- rent and the anastomotica magna; when tied below the inferior profunda by the additional anasto- mosis of this vessel with the posterior ulnar re- current. The RADIAL AND ULNAR ARTERIES may be tied for —1, aneurysm of either vessel, or, 2, wound of the palmar arch; but it is a question whether ligature of the brachial is not preferable in the latter case, as the anasto- mosis between the radial and ulnar and the carpal and interosseous arteries is so free (Fig. 89). Both arteries in the case of a wound of the palmar arch need to be tied. This is best done at the ivrist where they are superficial and can be felt pulsating. The radial lies between the supinator longus and the flexor carpi radialis; the ulnar between the innermost tendon of the flexor sublimis digitorum, and the flexor carpi ulnaris, by which it is slightly over- lapped. An incision about an inch long through the integuments and deep fascia parallel to the course of either vessel, is all that is necessary to expose them. (Fig. 90, g, h). In the case of the ulnar, however, the flexor W. Y Fig. 90.—Lines of incision for ligature of arteries of the upper extremity.

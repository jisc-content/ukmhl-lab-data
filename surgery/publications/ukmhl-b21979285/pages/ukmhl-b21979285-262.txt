^46 DISEASES or SPECIAL TlSSfES. are often capped with cartilage, and are regarded by some as ossifying encliondromata. The enchondromata rarely ossify, but may undergo calcification or mucoid softening, and when unmixed with sarcomatous elements are quite innocent. Symptoms.—:Their slow growth, great hardness, evident attachment to the bone, the absence of glandular enlarge- ment, and non-implication of the surrounding tissues and FiBEOMATA OE.

They then consti- tute the common form of epulis and naso-pharyngeal polypus respectively^ and are described under Diseases of the Jaws and Nose. LiPOMATA OE EATTY TTJMOUES too rarely occur in bone to require special mention. I have seen one or two grow- ing from the outer surface of the periosteum {parosteal lipoma). They were not diagnosed before operation. Saecomata in bone may be divided into the perios- teal and the endosteal, the former being commonly of the round-celled, spindle-celled, or mixed variety, the latter of the myeloid variety. The periosteal (Fig. 62) spring skin will serve for their dia- gnosis. When of large size ulceration of the integuments covering them may be pro- duced by their pressure. Treatment.—If small, and involving, say, only one finger, they may be enucle- ated, taking care not to in- jure the neighbouring joint. But when several fingers are implicated, and the hand is rendered useless, amputation of the affected fingers, or of the whole hand, may be necessary. The removal of the limb is usually called for when they grow about the articular end of a long bone, especially if they have at- tained a large size.

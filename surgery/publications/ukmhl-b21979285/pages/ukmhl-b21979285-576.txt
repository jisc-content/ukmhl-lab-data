The twisted suture should be left on till firm union has occurred, and the strapping re-applied. Where the fissure does not extend through the whole lip, an inverted Y-shaped incision may be made, with its angle just above the apex of the cleft (Fig. 198), each arm stopping short of the prolabium; the tissues included in the arms of the Y should now be drawn down, and a diamond-shaped wound thus formed (Fig. 199). On bringing the raw surfaces together, a projection in place of the fissure will exist on the free border of the lip (Fig. 200); but this will disappear in time, leaving the lip nearly natural. When there is Fig. 198. Fig. 199. Fig. 200. Figs. 198, 199, 200.—Operation for single hare-hp v/hen the fissure does not extend into the nostril. much irregularity between the two portions of the lip (see Fig. 201), the incision on the shallower side should stop short of the prolabium, so as to allow the flap thus formed to remain attached at its base. On the deeper side the incision should slope off at an angle through the prolabium, completely removing the tissue. The flap left on the shallower side should be now turned down and united to the sloped-ofE portion on the deeper side, and the vertical portions of the incision brought together as usual. Thus, what was the free edge of the cleft on the shallower side, now becomes the free edge of the lip (Fig. 202). Operation for double hare-lip.—When the premaxillary process projects, it should not, as a rule, be removed, but be forced back into place by partially detaching it with the cutting pliers blunted by being wrapped in lint, and the lip united over it. There are many ways of uniting the lip. The simplest, perhaps (Figs. 203 and 204), con- sists in paring completely the central portion, and then

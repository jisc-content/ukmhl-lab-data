DISEASES or SPECIAL TISSUES. 352 relapse. It is most frequent in women, begins in young adult life, is very chronic in its course, and is often com- plicated by attacks of erysipelas. Treatment.â€”The general health should be attended to, and arsenic, cod-liver oil, or iron should be given if indicated. Local treatment, however, is the only efficient means. Yery numerous applications for relieving the itching and promoting absorption have been recommended, such as mercurial plaster, iodine, and oleate of zinc; but the best method is linear scarification, which must be repeated from time to time for considerable periods. Ingrowing nail is most frequently met with in the great toe as the result of wearing tight boots and of cutting the nail square. The tight boot presses the skin over the sharp corner of the nail on each side, and ulcera- tion, attended by the formation of exquisitely tender and exuberant granulations, results, giving the part the ap- pearance as if the nail had grown into the flesh. The condition is a very painful one, and troublesome to cure. The treatment consists in wearing square-toed boots, so as to provide plenty of room for the toes, and then pressing a piece of tinfoil or lint between the edge of the ' in- growing ' nail and the overhanging portion of skin. Should this not succeed a longitudinal strip of nail should be removed, and the prominent granulations and redun- dant skin shaved away to the level of the nail, together with that portion of the matrix corresponding to the strip of nail removed. As the operation is excessively painful, it should be done under an ansesthetic; or the ether spray may be used, or the part painted with cocaine. Hypertrophy of the toe-nail occasionally occurs as the result of neglect or chronic congestion of the matrix, and may assume the form of a horn. The treatment con- sists in cutting away the hypertrophied portion or in removing the whole nail.

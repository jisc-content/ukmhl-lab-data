cock's operation of perineal section. 785 apart. Withdraw the staff a little, turn it so that the groove looks towards the pubes, and catch up the upper angle of the opened urethra by the hooked end. The urethra is thus held open at three points (Fig. 306). Search for the stricture, and pass a slender probe-pointed director through it into the bladder. Divide the stricture with a probe-pointed bistoury run along the groove in the director. Pass the point of the probe-gorget (Fig. 307) along the groove of the director towards the bladder, dilating the divided stricture. Introduce a gum-elastic catheter from the meatus into the wound, and guide it by the gorget into the bladder. Withdraw the gorget, and retain the catheter in the urethra for three or four days. The catheter should allow a catgut bougie to pass through it to act as a guide when it has to be changed. CocVs operation of perineal section^ or tapping the dilated urethra at the apex of the prostate '' unassisted by a guide staff." Secure the patient in the lithotomy position. Pass the left forefinger into the rectum, and place its point on the apex of the prostate. Plunge a double-edged scalpel (Cock's knife) boldly into the median line of the perineum, and carry it towards the tip of the finger in the rectum. Enlarge the incision by an upward and downward move- ment of the knife, but do not withdraw it. When the point is felt near the tip of the finger, pass it onwards into the urethra. Withdraw the knife, keep the finger in the rectum, and guide a probe-pointed director into the bladder. Withdraw the finger from the rectum, and pass a cannula along the director into the bladder, and tie it in for a few days. This appears to be a good opera- tion for impervious stricture with fistulae and much induration of the perineum, and is held in considerable favour by some of the Gruy's Surgeons.

DISEASES OF ARTERIES. 289 1^ the artery, loss of pulse in the vessel, and often gangrene of the part supplied by it. Its pathology is not known, but there is evidence that points to its depending more on some nerve change than on an inflammation of the artery itself. Primary degeneration of arteries. — We have already seen that fatty, calcareous, and fibroid degenera- tion may follow chronic endarteritis. These changes may, however, occur as primary affec- tions, and may next be considered. Primary fatty degeneration begins in the superficial layers of the intima, immediately under the endothelium. It takes the form of yellowish-white patches, very slightly projecting into the vessel. The patches can be readily stripped oft from the deeper layers, which when thus Gxposed are found healthy; whereas, in atheroma, it is the deeper layers which are the seat of the disease. The disease is attended with no signs, and is of little practical interest. Primary calcification is of more im- portance. It should be distinguished from calcification occurring as a second- ary change in endarteritis. Primary calcification begins in the circular muscular fibres of the middle coat, and is more common in the smaller than in the larger arteries, and in those of the lower than in those of the upper extremity. It is a disease of advancing age, and is a frequent cause of senile gangrene in that the arteries are converted into rigid tubes and the circula- tion through them is in consequence greatly impeded. Thrombosis, moreover, is very liable to occur. In primary calcification the lime salts are deposited in the form of rings (Pig. 78) instead of in irregular patches as in secondary calcification. Fibroid degeneration.—Por a description of this a work on Medicine must be consulted. Fig. 78.—Primary calcification of arteries. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Mu- seum. ) W. u

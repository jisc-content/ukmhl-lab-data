TUMOURS—SARCOMATA. 81 round-celled^ {l) the spindle-celled, (c) the giant-celled or myeloid and [a) the mixed-celled. {a.) The round-celled sarcomata usually occur as soft, vascular, and very rapidly growing tumours, and often attain a large size, and quickly become disseminated through distant parts of the body and through internal organs. Structure.—They consist- of round cells like leucocytes, varying in size in different tumours, and embedded in a small amount of granular or homogeneous intercellular substance. On section they appear soft and vascular, resembling brain matter. Hence the term encephaloid or medullary which is sometimes applied to them. It was this variety of sarcoma that was formerly called enceplia- loid cancer. The microscopical appearance of a typical specimen is shown in Eig. 12. Secondary changes.—They may undergo mucoid soften- ing, fatty degeneration and ulceration, or blood may be extravasated in their substance leading to the formation of cysts [sarcomatous hlood-cysts). Usual seats.—Wherever fibrous tissue exists; but they are most common in the periosteum, bone, skin, sub- cutaneous tissue and testicle. Varieties of round-celled sarcoma, — 1. The glio- «arcoma, which grows in the connective tissue of nerves, and has a matrix like that of the neuroglia of nerve centres. It occurs most frequently in the retina and brain. 2. The lymphosarcoma, which grows in the lymphatic glands. It consists of a reticulum resembling lymphoid tissue, and the sarcoma cells are usually of the size of leucocytes. 3. The psammoma, s. very rare form which occurs only in the pineal body and orbit. 4. The alveolar sarcoma, in which the matrix forms a net-work

oOO INJUBIES OF BEGIONS. not extending beyond the internal malleolus, should line the splint. The splint is bandaged on from above downwards, and the leg having been thus secured, the foot is brought over to the splint by making figure- of-eight turns over the ankle and foot and through the notches at the lower end of the splint. The bandage should not pass over the external malleolus or the seat of fracture. The great objection to the use of this splint is, that having no foot^piece, the foot is not kept at a right angle to the leg. The tarsus.—Fractures of the bones of the tarsus are for the most part the result of great violence, and are rare. Fig. 177.—Dupuytren's sphnt for Pott's fracture. The only one calling for passing notice is fracture of the OS calcis, which may occur from a fall on the heel, passage of a wheel over the foot, or violent contraction of the calf- muscles. Crepitus, and, when the line of fracture is behind the interosseous ligament, some drawing up of the posterior fragment by the tendo Achillis, are the chief signs. But where there is much swelling and bruising of the soft parts, the fracture, as is the case in fractures of the astrag- alus and of the other tarsal bones, may be very difficult to diagnose. Eest, with the foot and leg on a splint, in such a position as to relax the calf-muscles where there is much displacement, and an ice-bag to subdue inflam- mation, are the points to be attended to with regard to treatment. When the case is seen early, and there is but little swelling, a plaster-of-Paris splint or bandage may be advantageously used. The metatarsal bones and phalanges of the toes may be fractured by direct violence. No special descrip- tion, however, of these fractures is necessary. o

109 TREATMENT OF WOUNDS. withdrawn. The drain-tube should consist of red-rubber tubing, varying in calibre according to the size of the wound. It should have lateral holes cut in it to facilitate the >escape of the discharge, and should be made thoroughly aseptic by being kept in some antiseptic fluid. It had better be passed through the first layer of dressing, and its mouth surrounded by some absorbent material to take up the discharges. Where the wound is deep, the tube should be secured by an antiseptic thread, lest it slip in, and becoming lost in the depths of the wound, sub- sequently act as a foreign body. Tubes of decalcified bone have been used in the hope that they would become absorbed, and so prevent the necessity of disturbing the dressings; but they do not appear to have had the desired Fig. 24.—Surgical needles and hare-lip pin. effect. Eecently a reaction seems to have set in against the use of drains of all kinds. Where they are dispensed with the skin wound is not as a rule tightly closed, and the deeper parts of the wound are maintained in close apposition by means of buried or deep sutures and the application of firm pressure over a thick layer of ab- sorbent and antiseptic dressing. 4. Closure of the toound,—The surfaces should be placed in contact, and the edges accurately united by suture, strapping, or a bandage. Where the wound involves different layers of tissue, muscle and fascia should be united, each to each, by aseptic sutures. In uniting the edges of the wound, care should be taken to see that the skin is neither inverted nor everted, and that the sutures, whatever form is used, are only tied sufiiciently tight to keep the edges in apposition. All tension should be avoided, as this in itself is a fertile cause of inflammation. The sutures may consist of silver-wire, silk, catgut, silkworm-gut, or horse-hair. All kinds have their

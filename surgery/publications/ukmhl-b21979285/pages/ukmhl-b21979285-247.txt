231 NECROSIS. generally limited to the external lamellse of the bone {'peripheral necrosis); when to simple osteo-myelitis, to the layers immediately surrounding the medullary canal [central necrosis); when to diffuse, septic or infective periostitis or osteo-myelitis, it may affect the whole thickness of the shaft (Fig. 51), and possibly the whole diaphysis [total necrosis); whilst when due to osteitis it is usually associated with caries, and only a portion of cancellous tissue perishes [caries necrotica). Characters of dead hone,—^l?he dead bone, which is called a sequestrum or an exfoliation, is bloodless, white, hard, Fig. 53.—Syphilitic necrosis of the skull, (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) dry and sonorous when struck, but often becomes brown or black when exposed to the air and the action of the discharges. Its free surface is smooth and even, or if previously inflamed, rough and irregular; its margins are serrated and ragged; and its previously attached surface is rough and uneven. It is heavy when sclerotic changes have occurred, light and porous when associated with caries. Process of separation.—^When a portion of bone has become necrosed it acts as a foreign body and nature tries to cast it off. In some situations she is successful, in others she fails, and if not assisted by art the dead bone may remain as a lifelong source of irrita- tion. The separation of dead bone is best studied in

229 EAEEFYmG OSTEITIS OR CARIES. in solution escapes from them. On probing or on en- larging the sinus and introducing the finger, the bone is felt to be soft and friable, breaking down and readily bleeding. Caries of the vei:tebr8e and of the articular ends of bone will be described under Diseases of the Spine and Joints respectively. The treatment will necessarily vary according to the situation of the disease. When accessible the carious bone may be gouged away. In doing this it will be known when all the _ carious bone is removed Jby the part becoming hard to the gouge. The sinuses should be well scraped with a Volkmann's spoon, and the wound dressed with iodof orm-glycerine emul sion and iodoform gauze. Unfortu- nately, however,. after the carious part has been removed the disease may recur in the surrounding bone, so that in caries of the tarsus or carpus it may be better to excise the whole of the affected bone or bones, or where the caries is extensive, to amputate the foot or hand. Necrosis is the death en masse of the whole or part of a bone, and is analogous to gangrene of soft parts. It is, however, of more frequent oc- currence than gangrene, inasmuch as, owing to the hard and resisting nature of bone, the vessels are more liable to become compressed by the inflammatory effusion, and the blood- supply in consequence to be cut off. For the same reason necrosis is more common in compact than in cancel- lous bone; whilst the reverse holds good with regard to caries. Hence, moreover, necrosis is more frequent when the inflammation is acute, caries when it is less acute, as in the latter case the bone-trabeculse slowly yield and disintegrate before the less quickly-produced inflammatory exudation, and the vessels consequently escape compression. The bones inost often affected are the tibia, the femur, the lowej" Fig. 51. â€” Necrosis of shaft of tibia. (Druitt's Surgery.)

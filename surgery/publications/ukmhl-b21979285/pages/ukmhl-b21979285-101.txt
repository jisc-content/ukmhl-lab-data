The Mixed-celled.—Many sarcomatous tuniours consist of both spindle and round cells. They may resemble either the spindle- or the round-celled tumours, and cannot be distinguished without a microscopical examination. Sarcomatous Uood-cysts.—Soft sarcomatous tumours sometimes become completely broken down by extravasa- tion of blood into their substance, and converted into cysts containing partly fluid and partly coagulated blood. When such a cyst is punctured, the haemorrhage is often difficult to control. When cut into, the walls are gene- rally found ill-defined, and it may be impossible to dis- tinguish the cyst from a heematoma or ordinary blood- cyst, without a microscopical examination of a piece of the wall. II. EPIBLASTIC AND HYPOBLASTIC TUMOURS. These may be divided into the innocent and the malignant. Papillomata or warty and villous tumours re- semble in structure the papillae of the skin and mucous membrane. They include warts, condylomata, and mucous tubercles, and some forms of so-called villous tumours. They are innocent growths, rarely attain a Fig. 14.—Myeloid Sarcoma.

DISEASES OE SPECIAL TISSUES. 266 upon its invasion by the granulation-tissue derived from the synovial membrane and bone. In chronic osteo- arthritis the synovial membrane, at first dry, becomes slightly thickened and vascular, and moderately distended with turbid synovial fluid which at times resembles train oil. In the meanwhile the synovial fringes become hypertrophied, and assume the form of pedunculated pro- cesses, often containing little masses of cartilage or bone. These little masses may subsequently become detached and form loose bodies in the joint (Fig. 73). The Fig. 73.—Chi'onic osteo-arthritis of the knee-joint. The articular surface of the tibia is shown in the upper part of the figure : the patella is turned down. (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Museum.) articular surfaces of the bone become smooth, hard, polished, eburnated or porcellaneous in appearance and variously altered in shape—changes apparently depending in part on friction and mechanical pressure, and in part on the formation of new bone in the cancellous spaces, whereby the bone is rendered harder and is capable in consequence of receiving a higher polish. "Whilst, how- ever, new bone is being formed immediately beneath the polished surface, rarefaction and atrophy are going on a little deeper in the bone leading to the shortening and distortion so commonly observed. Hence, for example, the flattening and enlargement of the acetabulum and glenoid cavity, and the absorption of the neck and flatten- ing of the head of the femur and humerus, seen in osteo-arthritis of the hip (Pig. 74) and shoulder respec-

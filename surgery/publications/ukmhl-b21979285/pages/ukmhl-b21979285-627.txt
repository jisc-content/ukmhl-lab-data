GASTROSTOMY. 611 patient in stricture of the oesopliagus. The operation is now usually performed in two stages. In the first, the abdomen is opened, and the stomach secured by suture to the abdominal parietes ; in the second, which is not per- formed till from four to six days after the first, the stomach, which by this time has become adherent to the abdominal parietes, is punctured, and a tube introduced. 1. An oblique incision (Fig. 253, e) is made between two and three inches long, about an inch below, and parallel with the left costal cartilages, beginning about an inch and a half from the middle line (Howse). The sheath of the rectus is next opened, the fibres of the muscle sepa- rated, not cut, the posterior layer of the sheath divided, and the peritoneum exposed. Mr. Howse thinks that the fibres of the rectus subsequently play the part of a sphincter to the opening. All bleeding having been stopped, the peritoneal cavity is opened on a director, and the stomach sought and drawn into the wound if it does not already present there. It may be distinguished from the transverse colon by its thick, smooth, and pinkish-red coat. Two loops of silk are passed through Fig. 231.â€”A Symonds' tube in situ. R R 2

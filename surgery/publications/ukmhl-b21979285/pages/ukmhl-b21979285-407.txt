FOREIGN BODIES IN THE AIK PASSAGES. 391 fourth and fifth, ribs. When the foreign body has been pushed into the stomach the patient should be fed on oatmeal porridge, and made to swallow portions of hair, and the like, in the hope that the body, if angular, may become surrounded by this soft material and travel through the intestines without injuring them. Should it be too large to pass the pyloric valve, gastrotomy is the only resource. FOUEIGN BODIES IN THE AIR PASSAGES.—A foreign body may become lodged in the larynx, the trachea, or in one of the bronchi.

When a voluminous body, as a piece of meat, becomes impacted at the entrance of the larynx, it may block up the passage, causing instant suffocation. Smaller bodies, wherever situated, may also cause fatal dyspnoea by setting up reflex spasm of the muscles of the glottis; though in some cases a foreign body, such as a tooth- plate, may be so lodged between the cords as to prevent them closing. A foreign body in the ventricle may cause the same urgent symptoms.

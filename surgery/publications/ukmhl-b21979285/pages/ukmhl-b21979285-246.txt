Cause.—The immediate cause of necrosis, like gangrene, can in all cases be traced to the cutting off of the blood- supply of the bone, and this again may be due to inflam- mation, injury, or more rarely, as in the necrosis which sometimes occurs in old people, to some change in the vessels probably analogous to that producing senile gangrene of soft parts. The causes of inflammation of bone may, therefore, also be looked upon as causes of necrosis; but syphilis, the specific fevers, especially Fig. 52.—Diagram of the process of separation of dead bone, 6'.

Healthy living bone. scarlatina, and mercurial and phosphorous poisoning, may be particularly mentioned. Pathology.—In injury, the death of the bone is due to the stripping off of the periosteum, the destruction of the medullary membrane, or more rarely the plugging of the vessels in the Haversian canals with clots. In this wa.y necrosis may occur after compound fracture, or in stumps after amputation; but the inflammation that follows the injury has no doubt also a share in its production. The way in which necrosis is brought about in inflammation has already been described under periostitis, osteitis, and osteo-myelitis, and according as it results from one or other of these causes will it vary in its situation and extent, Thus, when due to simple periostitis it is

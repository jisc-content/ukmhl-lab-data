viii PREFACE. but a brief mention, or have been altogether omitted. The details of Operative Surgery, and Minor Surgery and Bandaging, and such other things as the student is taught practically to do for himself in the wards, have been only shortly discussed ; and no account has been given of the specialties of the Eye and Ear. It will be seen, therefore, that the book is in no way intended to take the place of any of the excellent Manuals of Surgery in present use, but rather to supplement them, and prepare the student the better to profit by their perusal at a subsequent stage in his studies. It is also hoped that it may serve to refresh his memory before presenting himself for examination in Surgery. My best thanks are due to Mr. Spencerj late House- Surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, for his kind- ness in reading through the proof-sheets, and to Mr. Godart, Artist to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, for his care in preparing and making drawings. I am also indebted to Messrs. Arnold and Son for the use of several woodcuts. The space at my command did not permit of refer- ence in the text to the authors consulted ; but I here express my indebtedness for the aid I have received from the works of Agnew, Billroth, Bryant, Erichsen, Holmes, and Pirrie, and from the various articles in Holmes' " System of Surgery," Heath's " Dictionary of Surgery," and Treves' "Manual of Surgery." 27, Weymouth Street, W., July, 1887.

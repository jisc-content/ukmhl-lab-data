651 SPINA BIFIDA. rather a depression in the situation of the cleft between the vertebrae [spina bifida occulta), the cleft being occupied by the blended membranes, cord, and skin, and the spot covered with a tuft of hair. Symptoms.—The swelling is usually of a globular or oval shape, translucent, sessile or slightly pedunculated and flaccid, but becomes tense and distended on coughing or crying. Pressing upon it sometimes causes the fontanelles to swell up, and may produce convulsions. When the spinal cord and large nerves are involved, Fig. 250.—Syringo-myelocele. 1 there may be paralysis of the extremities or of the bladder or rectum. The gap between the laminae of the vertebrae I may at times be felt on pressing on the sac. As a rule ' these tumours show a great tendency to enlarge, and rupture spontaneously, in which case death usually 1 follows from the draining away of the cerebro-spinal j fluid, and septic meningitis. Death, however, is some- I times due to marasmus and defective nutrition. When a j spontaneous cure takes place it is usually due to the I gradual shrinking of the sac. I Diagnosis.—Its congenital origin will at once distinguish I a spina bifida from a new growth developed subsequently to birth ; and its situation in the middle line, translucency.

Sulphide of soda in ten-grain doses has been recommended on account of the beneficial effect it exercises in splenic fever in animals. Actinomycosis is an infective disease depending upon the presence in the tissues of a micro-organism, the acti- nomyces. Cause.—The disease, which is prevalent in cattle, mar be transmitted to man either directly from the diseased animal, as sometimes occurs in cowmen, or indirectly through the medium of uncooked meat or milk. It may Fig. 36.—Actinomycetes—tbe parasite of actinomycosis. also apparently be transmitted by cereals. A grain of barley has been found in several growths. The com- monest site of inoculation is through a carious tooth, but the parasite may also gain admission by the alimentary and respiratory tracts. Pathology,—The actinomyces, having entered the tissues, sets up a progressive inflammation leading to the forma- tion of granulation-tissue, connective tissue and pus. The pus contains pale yellow, or sometimes white or brown grains, which are visible to the naked eye when the pns is spread out in a thin layer, the larger grains being about the size of a pin's head. These grains, which consist of the parasite, are seen, on microscopical examination, to be made up of fine threads of mycelium, with rod-like bacilli radiating from their ends (see Fig. 36). In cattle, the disease affects chiefly the lower jaw, but

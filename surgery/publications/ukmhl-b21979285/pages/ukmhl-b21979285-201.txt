185 SEPARATION OF EPIPHYSES. Treatment.—If the fracture is recent, and the fragments are not firmly united, the patient should be placed under an anaesthetic, the faulty position rectified, and splints properly applied. If firm union has already occurred, an attempt should be made to re-fracture the bone under an anaesthetic; and if this fails, as also in long-standing Fig. 42.—Malimited fracture. ig. 43.—Vicious union after (St. Bartholomew's Hospital fracture. (St. Bartholomew's Museum.) Hospital Museum.) cases, osteoclasia or subcutaneous osteotomy may in some instances be performed, or a wedge-shaped piece of bone removed. Where a sharp fragment projects beneath the skin, it may sometimes be sawn off with advantage, though it should be remembered that it will often become rounded of£ with time. Separation of epiphyses.—This injury may be re- garded as a variety of fracture. It consists in the forcible wrenching of the epiphysis from the shaft at their cartilaginous line of union, and consequently can

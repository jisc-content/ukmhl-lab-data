INJURIES OF REGIONS. 418 director, and at the same time invaginate the ring-lined upper portion of the intestine into the lower portion (Fig. 116) to the extent of the whole width of the ring. Tie the sutures only sufficiently tightly to prevent dis- invagination. The two peritoneal surfaces are thus held in close contact by the rubber ring. The intestinal con- tents, says Senn, pass freely through the lumen of the ring from above downwards, and escape from below is impossible, as the free end of the intussuscipiens secures Figs. 115 and 116.—Senn's method of circular enterorrhaphy.

The catgut sutures fixing the ring are absorbed, and the ring, reconverted into a band, is passed per anum. The invagination sutures are believed by Senn to be removed by substitution on the part of the tissues. Hence the punctures of the bowel remain closed and extravasation is prevented. Intestinal anastomosis y or the restoration of the conti- nuity of the intestine by Senn's decalcified bone-plates after complete division or excision of a portion of intes- tine is done as follows:—Having let what faeces will escape from the proximal portion of the intestine, clamp

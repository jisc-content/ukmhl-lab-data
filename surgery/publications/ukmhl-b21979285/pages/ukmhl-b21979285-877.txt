APPENDIX. ♦ AMPUTATIONS. Amputations.—The objects that should be kept in view in performing an amputation are :—1, to remove the whole of the injured or diseased part that is beyond the reach of recovery, with as little sacrifice of the healthy tissues as possible ; 2, to prevent all unnecessary haemor- rhage; 3, to secure a sufficient covering for the end of the bone; 4, to avoid adhesion of the cicatrix to the bone; 5, to divide the large blood-vessels and nerves transversely, and leave their cut ends in such a part of the stump that they may be little exposed to pressure; and 6, to ensure an efficient drain and aseptic condition of the wound. Amputations may be performed by the circular or by the flap method. In the circular metJiod the integuments are first divided by a circular incision round the entire circumference of the limb. They are then retracted, and the muscles divided higher up the limb by a similar circular sweep of the knife. The muscles are next in their turn retracted, and the periosteum is divided still higher up the bone, which is finally sawn through at that spot. This method possesses the advantages that the vessels and nerves are divided transversely, and that the wound is of moderate dimensions; but the cicatrix is opposite the end of the bone, the coverings for the latter are apt to be deficient, and the stump is liable to assume a conical shape. The circular method is now seldom employed, except for amputation of the arm. In the flap method, double flaps, or a single anterior or posterior flap, are provided for the covering of the bone. The flap or flaps may consist of integuments alone, or of more or less of the muscular and other soft tissues as well. In the former case the flaps are cut and reflected, and the muscles and other soft parts are then divided at the level of the base of the flaps in a .circular inanner down to the

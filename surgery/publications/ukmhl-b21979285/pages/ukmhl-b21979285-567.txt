EHRORS OF RErRACTION AND ACCOMMODATION. 551 further back (My.) from the lens tha^ the focal point; and rays coming from a point (C) beyond infinity {convergent) are focussed at H between the lens and its principal focus Em. Emmetropia.—In an eye of normal refraction {emme- tropia) with its accommodation relaxed, parallel rays (P) passing through the pupil will be focussed by the surfaces at a point (Em.) represented by the external surfaces of the rod and cone layer of the retina; divergent rays (D) will be focussed behind the retina at My. ; and convergent rays (C) in front of the retina at H. In order to focus the diver- gent rays (D) upon the retina (Em.) it is necessary to in- crease the convexity of the lens and so shorten its focal Fig. 195.—Diagram to illustrate errors of refraction.

This is done by accommodation, and a young emmetrope with normal accommodation should be able to focus on his retina all rays from parallel to divergent ones starting from a few inches from his cornea. Hypermetropia is the condition in which in the eye at rest the retina (H) only receives convergent rays (C)-; parallel rays (P) and divergent rays (D) are refracted beyond the retina (H). This takes place from too short a distance between the cornea and the retina, or from lessened con- vexity of the lens; the usual cause is congenital shortness of the axis of the eye. Hypermetropes from this fact are obliged to accommodate for parallel rays and still more for divergent ones. The treatment naturally is to increase the V My.

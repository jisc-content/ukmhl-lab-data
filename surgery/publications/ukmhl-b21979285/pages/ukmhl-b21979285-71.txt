It would appear, therefore, that the so-called strumous inflammations, though often tubercular, are sometimes of a simple chronic character, and only distinguishable from ordinary chronic inflammations by the indolence of their course and the tendency of their products to undergo caseation or become secondarily infected by the tubercle bacillus. And further that the strumous condition or diathesis is a constitutional state in which certain tissues and organs possess a feeble resisting power, and are hence exceedingly liable to be infected by the tubercle bacillus or on very slight injury to become inflamed, whilst the most trifling irritation, as friction, tension, or pressure, is then sufiicient to keep such inflammation up. The causes of the condition known as the strumous diathesis are hardly known, but it is thought to be here- ditary, and has been attributed to bad hygienic conditions of all kinds, as impure air, dark and damp dwellings, improper or insufficient food, &c. It is said to be espe- cially common in children born of dyspeptic or phthisical, or very young or very old parents. Syphilis in the parent is also believed by some to be a cause. Symptoms,—The general symptoms which are usually regarded as strumous, irrespective of any of the local lesions, as enlargement of the tonsils or of the lympathic glands, eczematous eruptions of the skin, disease in the bones or joints, and catarrh of the mucous membranes, are thus given by Sir William Savory, who speaks of two chief forms of the diathesis :—"In tlEie first, distinguished as the sanguineous or serous, there is a general want of muscular development; for although the figure may be sometimes plump and full, the limbs are soft and flabby ; the skin is fair and thin, showing the blue veins beneath it; the features are very delicate; often a brilliantly transparent rosy colour of the cheeks contrasts strongly and strikingly with the surrounding pallor ; the eyes grey or blue, are large and humid, with sluggish pupils sheltered by long silken lashes ; hair fine, blonde, auburn, or red ; teeth white and often brittle; there is frequently a fulness of the upper lip and alse nasi; the ends of the fingers are commonly broad, with convex nails bent over their ex- tremities. Such persons usually possess much energy and sensibility, with elasticity and buoyancy of spirits; they often possess, too, considerable beauty. In this variety, with the same delicacy, the skin and eyes are

494 INJURIES OF REGIONS. the patella together. The latter proceeding, it cannot be denied, has often secured bony union without any ill effects, but on the other hand, suppuration, stiff-joint, amputation, and even loss of life have resulted. In the face of these facts, therefore, and considering that no such dangers attend the ordinary methods, and that by these methods a perfectly useful joint can be obtained, even though the union is only fibrous, I, for my own part, have always hesitated to undertake such an operation for a recent fracture of the patella. Eecently Mr. Barker has tied the fragments together subcutaneously by passing Fia. 170.—Mayo Roh-son's method of hokling fragments of patella a suture by the aid of a nsevus needle first behind the patella, and then in front of it between the patella and the skin. The blood is squeezed out of the joint, the frag- ments pressed together, and the sutures tied tightly, thus keeping the fragments in apposition. -The TIBIA AND FIBULA.—Both bones, or the tibia or fibula alone, may be fractured. Fracture of both hones, which is by far the most common variety, may be due to either direct or indirect violence. When the result of direct violence, the frac- ture occurs at the spot where the force is applied, and both bones are usually fractured more or less transversely, and in the same line; but when the result of indirect violence, the tibia generally first gives way at its weakest spot, i.e., about the junction of the middle with the lower in contact.

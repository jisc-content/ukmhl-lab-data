467 DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP. ruptured, tlie control which it exercises over the position of the bone is lost. Our attention here will only be directed to the regular dislocations. • Of these Bigelow describes seven, the first four of which are commonly known as the classical dislocations of Sir Astley Cooper.

Irregular. ches of Y ruptured to the dorsum ilii {the dorsal of 1. Dislocation Bigeloiu),—This is the most common form of dislocation of the hip. The head of the bone is thrown upwards and backwards on to the dorsum of the ilium., the articular surface of the head looking backwards, and the great trochanter forwards. The capsular ligament is generally ruptured at its lower and inner part, sometimes posteriorly, and the round ligament is usually torn. The Y ligament is uninjured, the external branch preventing eversion. The glutei muscles are raised from the ilium by the head ' of the bone, which is always situated above the tendon of the obturator internus. The other external rotators have been found variously lacerated or torn from their attach- ments. Signs (Fig. 147).—The limb is slightly flexed, adducted, rotated inwards, and .shortened, so that the, lower end oF the femur crosses tKe lower third of the^ opposite thigh, and the'^great toe rests on the instep of the' opposite foot.

537 IRIDECTOMY. rally due to dislocation of the lens), rupture of the ciliary border of the iris [coredialysis), a rent in the pupillary border, and prolapse of the iris after a perforating wound. The congenital abnormalities are difference in colour in both irides, irregularity in shape and position of pupil, multiple pupils (polycoria) remains of pupillary membrane, deficiency of part of iris {colohoma) and absence of iris {irideremia). In coloboma the deficiency is generally downwards and inwards, and is often combined with a similar condition of the choroid. IniDECTOMY.—This Operation may be performed (a) to improve the sight in cases of corneal opacity, anterior polar cataract and zonular cataract, (b) as a remedial measure in glaucoma, re lapsing iritis, and com- plete posterior synechia, and (c) in cataract ex- traction. ^ ^ Fig. 188.—Spring eye-speculum. Fia. 189.— Showing speculum in eye, fixation-forceps in position, and the keratome passed into the anterior chamber in the opera- tion of iridectomy downwards and inwards. Operation.—Place the patient in the recumbent posture and induce general anaesthesia, preferably by chloroform, or local anaesthesia, by means of cocaine (4°/^). Standing behind the patient's head introduce the spring speculum (Fig. 188), fix the conjunctiva near the cornea with fixa- tion-forceps opposite the place selected for the coloboma.' Pass the keratome by pressure perpendicularly through the cornea (Fig. 189), and then lowering its handle press the blade into the anterior chamber parallel to the iris ; now lower the handle still more till the point nearly touches the posterior surface of the cornea and then slowly withdraw the keratome. Give the fixation-forceps to an assistant to gently depress the eye; pass through

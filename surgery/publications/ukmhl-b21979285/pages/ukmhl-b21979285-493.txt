DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP. 477 pulleys attached to a staple in the floor, counter-exten- sion being made by the perineal band, which is carried upwards and inwards across the opposite shoulder, and attached to a staple in the wall. After the extension has been applied some time the head of the bone may be lifted over the edge of the acetabulum by a jack-towel, the thigh, if necessary, being rotated inwards at the same time. The patella may be dislocated outwards, inwards, upwards, and edgeways. The outward dislocation is the most common; the upward variety can only occur Fig. 158.:—Reduction of pubic dislocation by pulleys in extended position. (Cooper's Dislocations.) when the ligamentum patellae has been ruptured or divided. The outward and inward varieties may be complete or incomplete. In the dislocation edgeways, which is very rare, the patella rests vertically on one edge between the condyles, either the outer or the inner edge looking forwards, but most commonly the former. Cause, — Muscular action, or a blow on the outer or inner edge of the bone. Knock-knee predisposes to the outward dislocation. The signs are obvious, the position of the patella indicating the nature of the acci- dent. Treatment.—With the patient under chloroform, the thigh should be flexed on the abdomen, to relax the quadriceps extensor muscle; and the leg, for the same purpose, extended on the thigh. In the outward and inward dislocation, pressure should now be made on the edge of the patella that is further from the centre of the joint so as to raise the opposite edge and

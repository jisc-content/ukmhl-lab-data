Some effusion into the tunica vaginalis may at first occur; the two surfaces, however, rapidly become adherent, the skin is implicated, and a fun- gating mass protrudes externally. The lumbar glands are generally affected, the inguinal only becoming in- volved after the skin has been reached. In a typical case (Fig. 319) the growth appears, on section, like a mass of brain-matter, blotched in places with blood ; whilst fibrous bands, the remains of the trabeculse testis, are generally seen traversing the growth. Masses of cartilage are often found in the sarcomata, and cysts, sometimes containing intracystic growths, are not un- common {cystic sarcoma). The disease formerly described as cystic sarcocele would generally appear to be of such a nature. Signs.—The swelling is at first generally uniform, smooth, elastic or tense, and hard, and no distinction between the body and the epididymis can be made out; but later the cord becomes thickened and the lumbar glands enlarged, and the tumour may feel hard in one place and soft in another. Ultimately the skin becomes adherent, gives way, and a fungating mass, covered with a sanious discharge, protrudes.

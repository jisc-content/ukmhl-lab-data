78 GENERAL PATHOLOGY OE SUHGICAL DISEASES. the processes forming a delicate stroma in tlie meshes of which the homogeneous, gelatinous basis-substance is contained (Fig. 11). The round and spindle cells vary in number, and are not shown in the diagram. Fibrous tissue, fat, cartilage, and sometimes adenomatous and sarcomatous elements may likewise be present; but it is. questionable in these cases whether the tumour should not be regarded as a soft fibroma, lipoma, enchondroma, sarcoma, &c., undergoing mucoid degeneration. Secondary changes.—Fatty degeneration, inflammation, ulceration, and the formation of blood-cysts owing to rupture of the capillary vessels. Usual seats.—They are most often found in the nose, where they constitute the gelatinous polypus. They are Fia. 11.—Myxomatous Tumour. also found in the adipose, subcutaneous, submucous, ,and subserous tissue, and occasionally in the periosteum and medulla of bone and neurilemma of nerves. Signs.—Except when forming polypi, as in the nose, they resemble fatty and soft fibrous tumours, from which they cannot be diagnosed with certainty. The so-called gelatinous or mucous polypus will again be referred to under Diseases of the Nose. Treatment.—Eemoval where practicable. B. Tumours of the type of the higher connective tissues. The myomata or muscle tumours consisting of non- striated or even of striated muscular fibres; the neuromata consisting of true nervous tissue, either the grey or the

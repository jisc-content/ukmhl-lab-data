461 FRACTURES OF THE RADIUS AND ULNA. indirect violence. Both fragments are drawn towards the ulna, the upper by the pronator teres, the lower by the pronator quadratus. (Fig. 143.) Treatment.—Similar to that of fracture of both bones. 3. Fracture of the loiuer end of the radius (CoUes^ frac- ture).—The line of fracture generally runs transversely about three quarters of an inch above the articular surface of the bone. Cause.—Falls on the palm of the hand. It is more frequent in the old than in the young ; and is especially common in elderly women. Nature of the displacement.—Sometimes there may be no dis- placement, but generally the lower fragment with the hand is so displaced that the articular surface looks down- FiG. 143.—Fracture of the radius. (After Grray.) wards, and slightly backwards and. outwards, instead of downwards, forwards and inwards. This, according to Mr. E. W. Smith, is due to the action of the supinator longus, the extensors of the thumb, and the radial extensors of the carpus. By others it is believed to be due to the impaction of the upper fragment into the lower, a condition frequently met with in specimens preserved in museums.' Occasionally the lower fragment is displaced forwards in consequence of falls on the back of the hand. Comminution of the lower fragment with involvement of the wrist-joint frequently occurs. Signs.—Very characteristic. On the back of the wrist, just above the joint, there is a prominence caused by the backwardly displaced lower fragment, and above this a slight de- pression ; whilst on the palmar surface there is a promi- nence caused by the lower end of the upper fragment, corresponding to the dorsal depression, and below this a depression corresponding to the dorsal prominence. Pro- nation and supination are lost, the hand is deflected to the radial side, and the lower end of the ulna is promi- nent. The deformity is well seen in Fig. 144. These

173 INJURIES OF BONES. /, SECTION III. Injueies oe Special Tissues, injuries of bones. Fractures.â€”A fracture may be defined as a sudden and forcible solution of continuity of a bone. The Causes of. fracture are predisposing and exciting. 1. The jpredisposing causes may be enumerated as senile atrophy, fatty degeneration, rickets, mollities ossium, locomotor ataxy, strumous, tuberculous and syphilitic in- flammation, caries and necrosis, and malignant growths ; in brief, any condition rendering the bone unusually fragile, to which may be added the male sex as more frequently exposing to violence. 2. The exciting causes are either external violence or muscular action, (a) External violence may be direct or indirect. In fracture from direct violence the bone is broken at the spot where the violence is applied. Such fractures are usually attended with more serious consequences than fractures from indirect violence, since the soft parts are, as a rule, much injured, and the fragments comminuted or fissured, and, perhajDs, driven into important organs, as the lung in fracture of the ribs, or the brain in fracture of the cranium, &c. In indirect violence the fracture occurs at a distance from the spot where the violence is applied, as, for instance, a fracture of the clavicle from a fall on the arm. The bone usually breaks at its weakest spot, and the fracture may be rendered compound from the fragments, which are very sharp and irregular, being driven through the soft parts. Fracture from indirect violence is most common m the bones of the extremities, and the base of the skull. (6) Muscular action, except in the case of the patella, is not a common cause of fracture. "When the long bones are broken in this way, they are usually the seat of some of the diseases mentioned above as predisposing causes. "When a bone infiltrated with a malignant growth, or softened by mollities ossium, breaks from very slight violence, the fracture is said to occui' sjjontaneoiisly.

The conditions oe a hernia.—A hernia may be : (1) reducible; (2) irreducible; (3) strangulated; (4) in- carcerated, and (5) inflamed. . 1. A REDUCIBLE HERNIA is One that can be returned into the abdominal cavity; i.e., it either goes back when the patient lies down; or it can be made to do so by the patient himself, or by the Surgeon making pressure upon it in a suitable direction.

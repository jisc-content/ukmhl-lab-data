488 INJURIES OE REGIONS. foot. The splint, well padded, is first bound to the foot and leg by a bandage carried tbrough the notches in the splint, and over the ankle in the form of a figure of 8, and then up the leg, and beyond the knee to prevent relaxation of the ligaments of the joint (Fig. 163). A perineal band having been previously adjusted, and its ends brought out through the holes in the top of the splint, is now tightened, whilst extension is made upon the foot. The ends of the perineal band, as soon as the fracture is reduced, are securely tied. The band thus acts as a counter-extending force, and the displacement is prevented from returning. A broad bandage is finally passed round the thorax to confine the splint to the side. The perineal Fig. 163.â€”Liston's long splint.

It should take its bearings from the tuber ischii, and not rest between the tuber ischii and great trochanter, as here it would press on the great sciatic nerve. The splint is improved by a cross-bar at its lower end, to prevent the limb rolling outwards, and by an oval aperture opposite the external malleolus, to prevent pressure on that bone. As the perineal band is apt to chafe, some surgeons, in its place, employ, in com- bination with the long splint, the stirrup, weight and pulley for the purpose of extension, raising the bed at the foot so that the weight of the body may act as the counter- extending force. Many modifications of the long splint are in use; amongst these may be mentioned Beyer's, Desault's, Bryant's, and De Morgan's splints. Bryant's (Fig. 164) consists of two long splints united above and below by iron cross-bars in the way shown in the drawing, and interrupted opposite the trochanters to avoid

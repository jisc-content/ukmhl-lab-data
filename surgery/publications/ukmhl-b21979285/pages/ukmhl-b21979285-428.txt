Iq rupture of the spleen the signs are similar, save that the pain is referred to the left side, and there may be increase of the splenic dulness, and perhaps fracture of the ribs in that region. 3. Eupture of the stomach is attended with extreme collapse, and if not rapidly fatal, with intense pain in the region of the stomach, and vomiting of blood, followed by peritonitis. 4. In rupture of the intestines, in addition to the intense pain radiating over the abdomen, there may be vomiting, first of the contents of the stomach, then of bile, and tben of altered blood; blood in the stools; tympanites with dulness in the flanks ; and, later, peritonitis, o.

The swelling following rupture of the ureter may require tapping or free drainage. Wounds of the abdomen may be divided into the penetrating and non-penetrating, according as they do or do not involve the peritoneal cavity.

323 LiaATITRE OF AKTEHIES. artery. The small crural branch of the genito-crural nerve lies on the artery, and the circumflex iliac vein and vas deferens cross it just be- fore it passes under Poupart's ligament. The chief accidents that may occur during liga- ture are:—1.- Injury of the peritoneum; 2, wound of the vein; 3, wound of the sper- matic cord; 4, wound of the epigastric artery ; and 5, puncture of the circumflex iliac vein. The chief dangers after ligature are :—1, Gran- grene of the limb; 2, peri- tonitis ; 3, secondary haemor- rhage. Should secondary haemorrhage occur, carefully applied pressure must be tried. If this fails, nothing is left but the desperate expedient of cutting down on the bleed- ing vessel and trying to secure it. Davy's lever should be used to control the haemor- rhage during the operation. The peritoneum will be pro- bably opened, and success can hardly be hoped for. The collateral circulation (Pig. 91) is carried on chiefly by the anastomosis between the in- FiG. 91.—Diagram of the collateral circulation after ligature of ' the common iliac, external and internal iliac, femoral, pop- liteal, and arteries of the leg. a.

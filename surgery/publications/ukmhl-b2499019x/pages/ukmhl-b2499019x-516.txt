DISEASES OP THE RECTUM AND ANUS. 490 from the sigmoid flexure downwards, the anal aperture being altoge- ther wanting—or the anus may be open for an inch or two, with an obstruction beyond. * Treatment.—If the end of the intestine can be felt protruding when the child cries, a crucial incision maj' be made into it without delay— if it cannot be felt, a day or two should be waited, so that it may become distended with meconium, and then a cautious incision should be made with a double-edged bistoury, in the direction of the curve of the sacrum. If it succeed in reaching the bowel, the aperture should be kept open by tents. But if this operation should fail in reaching the bowel, or if the rectum appears to be altogether deficient, the only resource is the formation of an artificial anus in the left loin by Amussat’s operation. Vide p. 467. III. Spasm of the Sphincter Ani is known by violent pain of the anus, with difficulty of evacuating the faeces. On examination, the muscle feels hard, and resists the introduction of the finger. This affection may be caused by constipation of the bowels, or disorder of the health. It may occur in sudden paroxysms which soon go off, or may last permanently, and lead to organic thickening and stricture of the anus. Treatment.—In recent cases, a dose of calomel and Dover's powder, followed by castor oil, and by enemata of warm water with a little • Imperforate anus. From tlie King’s Coll. Museum.

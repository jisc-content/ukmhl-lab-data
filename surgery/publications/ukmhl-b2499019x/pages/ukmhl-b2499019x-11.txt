PREFACE. In bringing before my professional brethren a fifth edition of the present work, my first impulse is to express my thanks for the very favourable reception which this humble contribution to Surgical Literature has everywhere met with. This has made me doubly anxious that the present should not fall short of the preceding editions in utility. I have endeavoured to make this edition more complete and more practical, and to incorporate with it the various improvements which surgery has received during the last three years, but without adding materially to its bulk ; thus avoiding the common vice of books which pass through many editions, and which are apt to increase to an incon- venient size by the addition of new materials to the old. I have adhered to the original plan of the work, which is simple enough, and enables the various contents to be arranged in an intelli- gible order, so that the reader can readily find any part which he wishes to consult. The first Part is devoted to those affections of the entire constitu- tion which may be induced by disease or injury of any part; and which being common to the other subjects of the book, ought neces- sarily to be treated of first. In the second Part, the various elementary forms of local disease, that is to say the various changes which disease may effect in the structure of any part of the body, are passed in review ; beginning with congenital malformation, and the simpler errors of nutrition, and going on to that series of changes commonly called inflammatory, and to ulceration, gangrene, tubercle and carcinoma.

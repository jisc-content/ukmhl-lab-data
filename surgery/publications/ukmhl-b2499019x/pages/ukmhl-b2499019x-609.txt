AMPUTATION OF THE THIGH. 583 There are a few varieties in the manner of performing this circular operation that require a brief notice. Some surgeons, after having cut through the skin, dissect it from the fascia, and turn it back—a proceeding necessary enough if this operation is performed (which it never should be) when the cellular tissue is condensed and adherent. Again, if the patient is very emaciated, the circular incision may be carried down to the bone at once without ceremony, because in such patients the muscles alwaj's retract greatly. Sir C. Bell recommends the skin not to be divided quite circularly, but the knife to be inclined a little, first to one side then to the other, so as to make two oval flaps. The same may be done also in dividing the muscles. He fur- ther recommends that the limb should be raised perpendicularly whilst the bone is being sawn, so that the saw may be worked horizontally, by which means, he says, the bone may be divided more evenly, and much shorter, so that its end will be no more seen when the stump is depressed. 2. Flap Operation. — The flaps may be made, either from the inner and outer, or from the anterior and posterior aspects of the limb. The latter way is the most convenient if the amputation is low down; but the former, if it is in the middle or upper third ; because the end i of thp.-hnne,ig,Jiable_to,J).e tilted forwards by the ilmcus and psoas muscles, and to project between the lips of the wound. In perform- ' ing this operation, the surgeon, standing as before,* grasps the flesh on the anterior surface ol the liiiilj wiili his left hand, and lifts it from the bone; then passes his knife horizontally through it—carries the Mr. Fergussoii thinks it more convenient that the surgeon should stand on the outer side in amputating the right thigh, as it is awkward to stoop over the sound limb; which, moreover, is in the way of the surgeon’s hand.

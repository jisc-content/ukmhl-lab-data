560 CHAPTER XXIV. OF THE DISEASES OF THE HANDS AND FEET. CLUB-FOOT, AND OTHER DEFORMITIES OF THE LIMBS. I. Club-Foot (Talipes) signifies a peculiar deformitj' of the foot, produced by rigidity and contraction of the muscles of the leg. 1. In the most simple variety, which is called talipes eejuinus, the heel merely is raised, so that the patient walks on the ball of the’ foot. 2. In the talipes varus, which is far more common, the dis- tortion is much more complex. In the first place the heel is raised ; secondly, the inner edge of the foot is drawn upwards ; and thirdl}', the whole foot is twisted inwards; so that the patient walks on the outer edge, and in confirmed cases, on the dorsum of the foot, and outer ankle. The next figure shows the talipes varus. 3. In the talijxs vah/us the outer edge of the foot is raised up, and the patient w’alks on the inner ankle. Cutises.—Tills affection con- sists essentially in that state of shortening and rigidity of the muscles of the calf, which we have described as ripid atrophy (vide p. 207). The exciting causes are various circumstances that interfere with the supply of nervous influence, or with the proper nutrition of the muscles. Thus it may be a consequence of fevers; of injuries of the spine ; of diseases of the brain; of division of the sciatic nerve; of long confinement and inactivity; of repeated attacks of rheumatic or other kinds of inflammation of the muscles of the calf; or it may be a sjnnpathetic consequence of irritation of the bowels, or of some other part of the system ; and lastly, it may be congenital, or produced during uterine life. As a proof of the imperfect nutrition and innervation of the distorted limb, it is always cold and feeble; the bones are small, and the muscles wasted. Treatment.—If this distortion is congenital, or commences in early • Talipes equinus, from a cast in the King’s College Museum.

AMPUTATION OF THE ARM. 586 made to transfix the limb ; this stage of the operation is represented in the preceding cut; and then the flap is cut, as above directed- When transfixing the right limb, the surgeon must take great care not to get his knife between the two bones. When the operation is per- formed high up, the popliteal artery will be divided instead of the (two tibials. The tibia, however, should never be sawn higher than •Pits ti^erqsity, or the joint will be laid open. The amputation maybe 'performed near the ankle in the same manner. If low down, the iRiido A chillis will require to be shortened after the flap is made. The flap is to be brought forwards, and confined by a stitch or two, the line of junction being of course horizontal. IV. A.mputation of the Arm.— In amputation of the upper iextremitj', the flow of blood may be sufficiently commanded by com- pressing the artery above the clavicle, or in the arm. If it is thought proper, however, the tourniquet may be applied so as to compress the arter}' against the humerus. 1. Circular,—The arm being held out, and an assistant drawing up the skin, one circular incision is made through the skin, which bcinn- forcibly retracted, another is made down to the bone. These incisions should be made with two slight divergences, so as to cut the skin and muscles rather longer in front and behind than at the sides. The subsequent steps are precisely similar to those m ampu- tating the thigh. • , i 2 /Vans.—The knife is entered at one side, earned down to tlic bone, turned over it, brought out at a point opposite (the vessels being left behind for the second flap), and then made to cut a neat rounded anterior flap two or three inches long. It is next earned behind the bone, to make a posterior one of equal length; and is

AMPUTATION OF THE HAND. 589 IX. Aimi’UTATIONS of the Hand.—1. Amputation of the fingers or thumb at their last joint may be performed thus: The surgeon holds the phalan.T firmly between his finger and thumb, and bends it, so as to give prominence to the head of the middle phalan.x. He then makes a straight incision across the head of the middle phalanx, so as to cut into the joint, and takes care to carry it deeply enough at the sides to divide the lateral ligaments. The joint being then thoroughlv opened, the b.stoury is carried through it, and made to cut a flap from the palmar surface of the last phalanx, sufficient to cover the head of tlie bone; and it is bettor to leave too much than too little.

570 ARTERIOTOSIY.—CUPPING. patient, if a child, being laid in a nurse's lap, with his head towards the surgeon, the latter puts his left thumb on the vein a little above the clavicle, and then opens it with a lancet, cutting towards the thumb, and in a direction downwards and inwards, so that the incision may cross the fibres of the platysma. When blood enough has been taken, the wound should be closed with lint and plaster, and not till then should the thumb be removed. The veins in the leg, scrotum, or neighbourhood of the eye or ear, can readilj’^ be opened in the same manner instead of the ordinary mode of veiioesectioii, or leeching, or cupping. Abscess in the cellular tissue, inflammation of the fascia, phlebitis, neuraigTaTvancose aneurism, and ancurismal varix, are occasional ill consequences of venaescction. III. Arterioto.-mv.—The temporal artery should be opened above the outer angle of the eyebrow—not just above the zygoma. The surgeon feels for the largest branch, steadies it with two fingers, one placed above, and the other below the intended puncture—then pushes in the lancet in the same manner as in venaescction. The incision should be directed across the vessel,and should cut itabout half through. When sufficient blood has flowed, the best plan is to introduce the lancet, and cut the vessel completely across, so that its ends maj* retract. A firm graduated compress should then be applied, and be confined with a bandage passing round the head; and some degree of pressure should be kept up on the wound for a week or ten days. Any subsequent bleeding or spurious aneurism must be treated by completel}' dividing the artery, if it has not been done already, and b)' pressure ; but if the wound is much inflamed or ulcerated, so as not to admit of pres- sure, a transverse incision should be made ou each side of it, and the artery be tied in both places. IV. Cupping.—The patient being placed in a comfortable position.

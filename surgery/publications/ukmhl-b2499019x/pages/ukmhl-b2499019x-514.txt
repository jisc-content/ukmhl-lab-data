Its treatment requires no distinct observations ; but if it should ever be necessary to operate for the relief of strangulation, care must be taken to avoid the epigastric artery.* III. Perinjeal Hernia descends between the bladder and rectum, forcing its way through tlie pelvic fascia and levator ani, and forming a tumour in the perinffium. IV. Vaginal Hernia is a variety of the preceding, in which the tumour projccts'dnto and blocks up the vagina, instead of descend- ing to the perinaeum. V. Labial or Pudendal Hernia descends between the vagina and ramus of the ischium, and forms a tumour in one of the labia. It is to be distinguished from inguinal hernia by the absence of swelling at the abdominal rings. These three hernia; must be re- placed by pressure with the fingers, and be kept up by pads made to bear against the perinaeum, and perhaps by hollow caoutchouc pes- saries worn in the vagina. VI. Obturator or Thyroid Hernia projects through that aper- ture in the obturator ligament which gives exit to the artery and nerve. In a fatal case related by Mr. Howship, in which a very small piece of intestine was strangulated in this opening, the patient • Mention is made in the Lend. Med.

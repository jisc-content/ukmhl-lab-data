I) THE SURGEON’S VADE MECUM. PART I. OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS OF LOCAL INJURY AND DISEASE. CHAPTER I. OF PROSTRATION, OR COLLAPSE.* Definition.—As tlie most proper commencement of a systematic treatise on Surgery, we shall begin by describing a state commonly known as prostration, or collapse, or shock to the 7tervous system; by which terms we signify that general depression of the powers and actions of life, which immediately follows any severe injury. Sy.mptoms.—The usual symptoms are, that the patient lies cold, and half-unconscious ; with a feeble pulse and imperfect sighing respi- ration. But these symptoms are liable to great variety ; for thej' may not only differ in severity in different cases, but likewise in the relative degree in which the principal bodily functions are disordered. Thus, sometimes depression of the vascular system predominates, and the patient lies in a state of perfect spicope, with the pulse and respi- ration imperceptible. Sometimes the nervous system is chiefly affected, the patient being bewildered and incoherent, as though intoxicated ; or even comatose, as though he had taken a narcotic poison. Nausea and vomiting ; hiccup ; suppression of urine ; and in children, con- vulsions, are also very frequent symptoms. The duration of these symptoms is also extremely various. Some- times they pass off very quickly; but they may remain even for forty- eight hours before reaction is thoroughly established. Terminations.^—The process of recovery from collapse is commonly called reaction; and the manner in which the case may tenninate must depend on the nature and degree of that reaction.

WOUNDS OF JOINTS. I The adjoining cut shows the portion of hone removed by Mr. H. Smith. After the operation the limb must be brought into the straight position, and bo kept at rest by means of a long splint, and the case be treated on general principles. If everything goes on well, the patient will recover a useful limb with a considerable degree of motion at the hip, and can walk comfortably with a high-heeled shoe.* SECTION VIll.—WOUNDS OF JOINTS. Symptoms.—A wound may often, but not invariably, be known to have penetrated a joint, by the escape of synovia, in the form of small oily globules. Treatment.—The object is to avert acute inflammation of the syno- vial membrane, which might prove fatal. If, therefore, the part wounded be the knee, and if the skin be so torn or injured that the wound cannot be closed, or so that it is certain not to unite by adhesion, and if the patient’s constitution be bad, amputation should be per- formed at once. Otherwise, the wound should be carcfullj' closed with a piece of lint dipped in blood ; the joint should be kept quite motionless on a splint ; and every local and constitutional measure be adopted, to avert or subdue inflammation.

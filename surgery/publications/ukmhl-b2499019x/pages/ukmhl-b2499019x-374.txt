DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 348 effused in the stdiaraclmoid cellular tissue, after partial adhesions had formed between the cord with its nerves, and the two layers of arachnoid covering its posterior siuface. But in some cases the cord and its nerves are found spread out upon the posterior wall of the sac without passing through its cavity ; and in these most probably the fluid was effused into the subarachnoid cellular tissue, after extensive adhesions had united the cord and its nerves to the two layers of arachnoid covering its posterior surface. Whereas, if the fluid be efiiised into the cavity of the arachnoid, before any adhesions foi-m be- tween the two layers of that membrane, no nerves will, in Mr. Hewett’s opinion, be connected with the sac. Terminations.—The tumour fonned hy a spina bifida, may varj- in size from that of a turkey’s egg, to that of an adult head ; and its in- teguments may be thick and covered with a dense cuticle, or may be thin and transparent. In some cases the tumour bursts dining the act of birth ; in most others, after the patient has lived some months or j-ears, it becomes enormously distended, and ulcerates, the patient speedily dying of the irritation : in one case, of a young woman, aged 27, which came under the author’s observation some time ago, and which has since been under the care of Mr. Walsh, the tumour re- lieves itself when distended by the exudation of a watery fluid through a minute aperture ; and in some few cases the patient lives to the ordinary span of life, without being much troubled with the deformity.

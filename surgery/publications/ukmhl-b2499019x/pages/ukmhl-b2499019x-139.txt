113 PART III. OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INJURIES. CHAPTER I. OF INCISED WOUNDS. Definition.—Wounds made witli clean-cutting instruments. Treat.ment.—There are four indications : — l, To arrest haemor- rhage; 2, to remove foreign bodies; 3, to bring the divided parts into apposition, and keep them in union; 4, to promote adhesion. (1) To arrest hcBmorrhayc, moderate pressure, a raised position, and the application of cold, will be sufficient in most cases;—but if an arterj" have been wounded, or the bleeding prove obstinate, the measures must be adopted which will be indicated in the Chapter on Wounds of Arteries. (2) The removal of foreign bodies if any arc in the wound should be effected as soon as possible. The best instruments for this and every other surgical puqiose which they can pcrfomi, are the fingers; —but they may be aided by probes and forceps, if necessary. Dirt, gnivel, &c., are best got rid of by affusion with water. All clots of blood must likewise be removed, or they will act as foreign bodies and prevent adhesion. (3) In order to bring the sides of the wound into apjwsition, the part must be placed in such a position as will relax any muscular fibres that have been divided, or that may be subjacent to the divided parts. Then the edges must be made to meet as nicely as they can without undue straining, and must be retained by cross strips of adhesive or isinglass plaster, one end of the plaster being first applied to that side of the wound which is loosest, and the other being brought across with a mild degree of traction. Then a light compress and bandage may be applied to keep on the dressings, and protect the parts from injurv'. If the wound is so situated that the plasters cannot be applied smoothly, a slip of lint may be laid on it first. (.'ollodion.—A very useful substitute for adhesive plasters in many cases is the solution of gun cotton in ether, commonly known by the I

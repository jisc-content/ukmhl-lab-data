607 THE PERONJEAL.â€”THE ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY* heel and the ankle, hut rather nearer to the latter. The integuments, the superficial fascia, and a verj^ strong tendinous aponeurosis, con- tinuous with the deep fascia of the leg, must be successively divided to the same extent. The sheath of the vessels which will be thus exposed must be opened, the venae comites separated, and the needle passed from the heel towards the ankle in order to avoid the nerve, which lies a little nearer to the heel. XVIII. The PeroNjEal artery may be exposed in the upper part of the leg by an incision similar to that which Mr. Guthrie proposes for the ligature of the posterior tibial, only rather more external. For the first few inches of its course, this vessel lies underneath the deep fascia ; afterwards it lies concealed under the inner edge of the flexor longus pollicis, which must be turned aside to expose it. But this is an operation which is enumerated rather from form than because it is of real utility. XIX. The Anterior Tibiae artery in the first third of its course, where it is covered by the extensor muscles, is very difficult to reach. If, however, it is expedient to place a ligature on it, an incision four or five inches in length must be made down to the fascia, in the direction of a line drawn from the head of the fibula to the base of the great toe. The intermuscular septum, between the tibialis anticus and extensor digitorum muscles must then be cut into, and the muscles

598 CHAPTER VI. OF THE LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. It may be as well to remind the reader, that when an artery is wounded, the wounded part should always, if possible, be exposed, and a ligature be placed both above and below it. If the wound in the superjacent parts pass directly to the vessel, it may be enlarged in the proper direction and to the requisite extent. If, however, the wound pass indirectly (from the back of the thigh, for instance, to the femoral artery), the part of the vessel'supposed to be wounded should be cut down upon in the ordinary way. In both cases the introduction of a probe will be a useful guide to the seat of injury. If the wounded part of the artery cannot be tied, a ligature must be placed on the main trunk above, at the nearest practicable point; and perhaps it may be expedient to place another below to prevent regurgitation. I. iHE Common Carotid Artery is generally tied below the spot where it is crossed by the omo-hyoideus muscle. The patient being placed on his back, with the shoulders raised, and with the head thrown back and slightly turned towards the opposite side, an incision

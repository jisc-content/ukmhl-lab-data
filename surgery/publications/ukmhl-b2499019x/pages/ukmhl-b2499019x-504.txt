INGUINAL HERNIA. 478 SECTION V. OP INGUINAL HERNIA. Definition.—Inguinal hernia is that which protrudes through one or both abdominal rings. Varieties.—There are four varieties. The oblique, direct, con- genital, and encysted. 1. The oblique inguinal hernia is the most common. It takes precisely the same route as the testicle takes in its passage from the abdomen into the scrotum. It commences as a fulness or swelling at the situation of the internal abdominal ring, that is to say, a little above the centre of Poupart’s ligament, next passes into the inguinal canal (and in this stage is called bubonocele), and if the protrusion increase, it projects through the external ring, and descends into tlie scrotum of the male, or labium of the female. The coverings of this hernia are, 1, Skin. 2, A strong layer of condensed cellular tissue, derived from the superficial fascia of the abdomen, in which the external epigastric artery ramifies. With this is mostly incorporated, 3, the fascia sper- matica, a tendinous layer, derived from the intercolumnar bands, a set of semicircular fibres which connect the two margins of the external ring. Under this lies, 4, the cremaster inuscle, sometimes called tunica communis. 5. Next comes the fascia propria, a cellular layer continuous with the fascia transversalis of the abdomen ; and lastly, 6, the sac. The internal epigastric arteiy is always internal to the • neck of the sac. The spermatic cord is generallj' behind the sac; but, in old cases, the parts which compose the spermatic cord are separated by the tumour, so that the vas deferens and spermatic artery lie some- times in front, sometimes on either side of it. 2.

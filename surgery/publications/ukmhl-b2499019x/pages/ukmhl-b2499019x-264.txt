FRACTURES OP THE SCAPULA. 230 part passes down the back, and is confined by a belt round the abdo- men. Besides these there is the clavicle bandage, which consists of two loops for the shoulders, attached to two pads resting on the scapulae, which are drawn together by straps and buckles ; and A mesburg's ap- paratus, which, although very complex, seems constructed in a manner that prevents all possibility of displacement. If nothing else will do, it should be procured at an instrument maker’s.* IV. Fractures of the Scapula.—The body of this bone maybe broken across by great direct violence. One case is known also in which it was fractured by muscular action.The symptoms are, great pain in moving the shoulder, and crepitus; which may be detected by placing one hand on the acromion or spinous process, and moving the shoulder or the inferior angle with the other. Treatment.—A roller must be passed round the tnink, and a few turns be made round the humerus, so as to fix the arm to the side, and prevent all motion. Bleeding, or at all events purging and low diet, will be required to avert inflammation of the chest. Fracture of the Neck of the Sc.\pula, by which is meant an oblique fracture, detaching the coracoid process and glenoid cavity from the rest of the bone, is a rare accident, insomuch that some sur- geons doubt its existence.I • Mr. Vincent treats all fractures and dislocations of the clavicle by merely placing the patients on flat beds, by which the parts assume and preserve their natural position. Bandages, he says, do*little good commonly, and arc not required if the patient keeps his bed.

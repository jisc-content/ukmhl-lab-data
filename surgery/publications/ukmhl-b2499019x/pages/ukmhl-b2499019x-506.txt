480 INGUINAL HERNIA. munication with the general peritonajal cavity has become obliterated. The sac of this hernia is consecpiently formed by the tunica vaginalis; its coverings in other respects are the same as those of the oblique variety, and the protruded bowel lies in immediate contact with the testicle, and if not replaced, generall}' adheres to it. 4. Tlie e?ici/sted (or hernia infarttilis) is a sub-variety of the conge- nital. The protruding bowel pushes before it a sac of peritonaeum either into or close behind the tunica vaginalis, and this tunic and the sac adhere very closely together. Tliis hernia, therefore, has, as it were, two sacs : viz. one proper sac, and anotlier anterior, composed of the tunica vaginalis, which in these cases is verj' liable to be the seat of hydrocele. The second figure in the preceding page, shows an- other variety of the encysted hernia, in which the sac is app.arently formed of tunica vaginalis, but its communication with the testicle is closed. Diagnosis—\. The difference between ih^-ohlique and direct in- guinal hernia, and their relations to the epigastric artery, ai-c shown in the accompanying figure, which is taken from Tiedeniann. In the oblique, the neck of the tumour inclines upwards and outwards, and causes a fulness extending up to the middle of Poupart s ligament. • In the direct, it inclines (if at all) rather inwards; and when the hernia is reduced, the finger, carrying integument before it, can be passed straight back into the abdominal cavity. But in old cases of oblique

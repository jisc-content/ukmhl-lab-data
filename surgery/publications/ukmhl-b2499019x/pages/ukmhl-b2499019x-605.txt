Bandage fob the Peuin.'eu.'m.â€”This consists of a circular girth for the loins; and of a piece that descends perpendicularly, and that is provided with a pad, covered with oiled silk, intended to press on the perinasum. The perpendicular piece is divided to enclose the scrotum or labia, and, lastly, is brought up in two portions to be attached to the circular girth in front. The circular girth may be kept up in its proper place by means of a pair of braces passing over the shoulders. This bandage is highly useful in prolapsus ani ; and in prolapsus uteri from rela.xation of the vagina ; in which firm pressure on the perinaeuin gives the greatest possible comfort.

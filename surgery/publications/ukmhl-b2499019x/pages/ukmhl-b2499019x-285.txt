It is to be well padded, and applied to the side opposite the fracture ; but it is not so easy to keep the foot in a proper position with this, as with the other apparatus. The surgeon will often find one or more bar/s of sand most conve- nient auxiliaries in keeping fractures of the leg in proper position. They may be used both to lay the broken limb upon, and also to put on either side to prevent the limb from rolling. This substance is so ponderous and devoid of elasticity that it steadily retains whatever position is given to it. Compound fracltircs of the leg are to be treated on the principles already laid down for the treatment of compound fracture in general. XIV. Fractures of the Foot will often be attended with so much other mischief as renders amputation expedient. But an at- tempt should bo made to save part of it; especially the ball of the great toe. Pasteboard splints and other contrivances must be used to preserve the proper position ; and if matter forms, there should be no delaj’ in freely dividing the dense fascim of the foot, to let it escape. The tuberosity of the os calcis may be broken by the action of the muscles attached to it, in the same manner as the patella and ole- cranon, and will unite only by ligament. The treatment must be the same as that of ruptured tendo Achillis. CHAPTER VI. OF THE DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE JOINTS. SECTION I. — OF THE DISEASES OF THE SYNOV'IAL MEiUlIRANE. I. Acute inflaimsiation of the synovial membrane {or synovitis) I may be produced by local or by constitutional causes. The former are I blows, strains, mechanical injuries, and especially penetrating wounds. The latter are, exposure to cold, the rheumatic and gouty diatheses, and the state of constitution produced by syphilis or the abuse of mercury;—sometimes, also, this disease is a sequel of gonorrhoea.

AMPUTATION OF THE WRIST. 588 tailed retractor, one tail of which is put between the bones, and the bones are then to be sawn through together, the saw being worked perpendicularly. The radial, ulnar, and two interosseous arteries require ligature. 2. Flaps.—The limb being placed in a state of pronation, the sur- geon makes a flap from the extensor side, just as is represented in the next cut; and he then transfixes the flexor side, and makes the other flap; taking care not to pass the knife between the bones, whilst performing cither transfixion. The interosseous parts are next divided, the flesh drawn upwards, and the bones sawn through. If the tendons project, they must be shortened. VIII. Amputatio.n of the Wrist.— 1. Circular. — The skin being pulled back, a circular incision is made a little below the level of the lino that separates the fore-arm from the palm of the hand. The external lateral ligament is then cut through, and the knife carried across the joint, to divide the remaining attachments. 2. Flaps.—A semi-lunar incision is made across the back of the wrist, its extremities being at the styloid processes, and its centre reaching down as far as the second row of carpal bones. This flap being dissected up, the joint is opened behind, the lateral ligaments are cut through, and the knife, being placed between the carpus and bones of the fore-arm, is made to cut out a flap from the anterior sur- face of the palm as represented in the next figure. This operation is scarcely to be preferred to amputation of the fore- arm low down, as the flaps with their numerous tendons may not unite readily, and there may be a difficulty in preserving flesh enough to cover the ends of the bones.

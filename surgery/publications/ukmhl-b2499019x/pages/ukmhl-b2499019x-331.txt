305 ANEURISM. the blood finds its way between the arterial tunics, and may even open into the artery at another part. Pathology. — The formation of aneurism is preceded by some disease of the artery. Sometimes the middle or fibrous coat becomes opake, }mllow, and as thin as paper; sometimes it degenerates into a fatty substance; and a soft, pultaceous, or, as it is called, mtheromatous matter is deposited upon it; this, according to Mr. Gulliver, displays under the microscope earthy and albuminous particles, oily globules, and crystal- line plates and scales; and is principally composed of cholesterine. At the same time the lining membrane often acquires considerable thickness and hardness ; in consequence, apparently, of an eftbrt to compensate for the weakness of the middle coat; and Dr. Davy believes that these changes must ter- minate either in aneurism, or in obliteration of the artery.-f- Or, lastly, there maybe a deposit of a brittle calcareous substance (com- posed of phosphate of lime) in the substance or on the outer surface of the inner tunic. This earthy matter may be deposited in spots, or scales, or rings, or pro- jecting spicula ; and in the arteries of elderly people it is very common. But the earthy degeneration of old age does not appear to be so common a cause of aneu- rism as the soft mtheroma- tous deposit. Aneurism generally com- mences by a giving way of This drawing exhibits an aneurism of tlie common femoral artoiT, for whicli the external iliac was tied by Sir B. Brodio. The ligature is seen, imbedded in lymph ; tile coagulura in the artery above and below it; and the laminated coagula in tlie aneurism.

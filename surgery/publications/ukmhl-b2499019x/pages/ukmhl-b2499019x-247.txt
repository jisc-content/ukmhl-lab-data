•221 DISEASES OF THE BONES. one form,—in which part of the shaft of a cylindrical bone dies, and is ) enclosed in a case of new bone. The term exfoliatmi signifies necrosis *7 of a thin superficial layer, which is not encased in any shell of new bone. J 1. Necrosis is a frequent consequence of inflammation of the shafts of long bones in children, especially of the femur and tibia. It more frequently attacks bones or parts of bones of compact tissue, than of spongy. Yet sometimes a small portion of the cancellous tissue in the centre of the head of a long bone becomes necrosed, with great detriment to the neighbouring joint. Necrosis of the lower jaw from the fumes of lucifer matches, will be noticed in the Chapter on Diseases of the Face and Mouth. Pathology.—The bone dies; but its periosteum and the surround- "| ing cellular tissue, if healthy, together with the articular extremities of J the bone, and its medullary membrane—any contiguous healthy parts in fact—effuse Ij-mph, which speedily ossifies, forming a new shell around the dead portion, and adhering to the living bone above and below it. The dead portion (technically called the sequestrum) generally consists of the circumference of the shaft only, and not of the entire thickness; for the interior of the shaft seems to be atrophied and absorbed after the death of the exterior. The inside of the sequestrum is usually rough, as if worm-eaten. In the majority of cases the epiphyses, or articular extremities, are fortunately unaffected. After a time, if the sequestrum is removed by art or accident, the newly-formed shell contracts, its cavity is abolished, and it gradually assumes the shape and function of the former bone. Microscopical appearances of Diseased Pone.—Healthy bone, when a thin section is e.xainined under the microscope, is shown to consist of

If it arise, in a healthy subject, from acute inflammation which is still progressing, there will be inflammatory fever ;—but, on the other hand, if the mortification be very extensive —if the inflammation of the adjacent parts be unhealthy, with no dis- position to form the line of demarcation, but, on the contrary, with a greater tendency to serous effusion—or if the mortified part be of great importance, as intestine or lung, the constitutional sjTnptoms will be of a low typhoid cast; there will be great anxiet3% hiccough, a jaun- diced skin, a soft or rapid, threadj', and jerking pulse ; and frequentlj” profuse perspiration of a cadaverous odour. Diagnosis.—It is important not to mistake the lividitj' and vesica- tions of bruises, especially wlien they acconipan}' fractures, for gan- grene. They maj' easily be distinguished bj" their sensibility and temperature ; and b_v the fact, that in gangrene the whole cuticle has lost its adhesion to the cutis, so that pressure will cause the vesicle to shift its place. Treatment.—The general indications are, to allay inflammation if excessive ; to support the strength ; and to cause the formation of a line of healthy adhesion, by which the mortification may be arrested. If gangrene occurs in a healthy, young, robust subject, with great pain, and a full, hard, strong pulse ; and if it appears likely to spread from the violence of inflammation, of which the best example is slough- ing of the penis from inflamed chancre, it will be necessary to use • From a cast in the King's College Museum.

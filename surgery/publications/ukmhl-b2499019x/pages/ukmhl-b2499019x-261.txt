235 FRACTUKE OF THE JAW. dressing forceps up the nostril, and applying the other externally, so as to grasp the fragment between them. Some practitioners ai’e in the habit of introducing tubes or plugs of oiled lint, in order to keep the fragments in their places ; but this appears to'be unnecessary and is very irritating. A plug of lint may, however, be requisite to check profuse hmmorrhage. If the fracture is compound, any loose splinters should be carefullj' removed. The great swelling, ecchymosis, bleed- ing from the nose, and headache, with which this injury is followed, will require to be combated by bleeding or leeches, purgatives and cold lotions, and spoon diet; and if collections of matter form, they should be opened without delay. If there are symptoms of pressure on the brain, and the vomer seems depressed, it should be carefully drawn forwards, if possible. II. Fracture of the Lower Jaw may be caused by violent blows. Its most usual situation, says Mr. Vincent, is at the situation of one of the eye-teeth. Sometimes in children (though rarely) it occurs at the symphysis, and still more rarely at the angle, or in the ascending ramus. Symptoms.—It is known by pain, swelling, inability to move the jaw, and irregularity of the teeth, because the anterior fragment is generally drawn downwards by the muscles arising from the hyoid bone, whilst the posterior fragment is fixed by the temporal. On moving the chin, whilst the hand is placed on the posterior fragment, crepitus will be felt; and the gums are lacerated and bleeding. The diagnosis of fracture of the ascending ramus will often be obscured by the great

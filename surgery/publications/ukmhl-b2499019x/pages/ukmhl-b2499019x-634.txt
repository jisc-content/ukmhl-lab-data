LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. 608 be separated down to the interosseous ligament, where the artery will be found. The foot should be moved backwards and forwards at the ankle, in order to ascertain with exactness the junction of the muscles. Below the middle of the leg, at any point to the termination of its course, this artery may be found on the fibular side of the extensor proprius pollicis tendon, which must be the guide for the incision. But it lies much more deeply in the living subject, than would be sur- mised from a mere dissection of the dead. The coverings must be divided with the usual precautions, and neither the peronasal nerve nor the venae comites should be wound- ed with the knife, or be included in the ligature. In wounds of the arteries in the sole of the foot (except perhaps of the external plantar, opposite the base of the little toe) before en- larging the wound with the view of securing the bleeding point, me- thodical pressure should be applied after the manner recommended at page 299 ; if that fails, the posterior tibia! artery should be tied behind the inner ankle, and the anterior tibial on the dorsum of the foot likewise, if necessiiry.* * For further information on tlicse operations, vide Manec on tlie Arteries ; the works of Harrison, Liston, and Fergussun, and Brittanâ€™s Translation of Malgaigne.

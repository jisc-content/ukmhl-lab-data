580 CHAPTER V. OF THE AMPUTATIONS. I. Amputation of the Thigh.â€”This amputation being probably the most important, and one tliat is very frequently practised, it will be convenient to describe it first; and to embody in the description of it such general precepts as are applicable to the other amputations. In the first place, the surgeon should have his tourniquets, ampu- tating knives, saws, forceps and tenacida, ligatures, bone-nippers, sponges, and curved needles threaded, close at hand on a tray, ar- ranged in due order; and he should see with his own eyes that every requisite is at hand before he begins. The ne.vt point is, to place the patient in a convenient posture. For amputation of the thigh, the patient may be placed on a bed, or on a table covered with a folded blanket; the diseased leg should project sufficiently over the edge, and should be supported at the knee by an assistant, who sits on a low stool in front; and the sound limb should be secured to one of the legs of the table with a handkerchief. Then measures must be adopted for compressing the main artery.

This paste is now to be spread with the spatula on the slightly heated groove of the caustic- holder, and, when it has cooled, any projection is to be removed with the spatula, or with pumice-stone.

The bougie must be equally thick throughout its whole length to about one inch from its point, from whence it should gradually taper, and terminate in a firm round point.

23 PART II. OF THE ELEMENTARY PROCESSES OF LOCAL DISEASE. CHAPTER I. OF MALFORMATION, HYPERTROPHY, ATROPHY, AND OTHER DEGENERATIONS OF TISSUES. I. Congenital Malforaiation.— In the present part of our work we propose to give a general view of the various forms of local disease, which may be met with in any part of the body, from any cause interfering with the regular processes of nutrition and function. Amongst these, the earliest in point of time, are the various original malformations, which occur through some inexplicable defect in the vital powers of the germ out of which the foetus is developed. Of such malformations, some depend on an arrest of development, through which various organs, or parts of organs, are left as it were incomplete and unfinished. Such are the cases, which come under the surgeon’s "notice, of spina bifida, or incomplete closure of the arches of the ver- tebra; ; such are hare-lip and cleft-palate, which arise from a similar condition of the bones and soft parts of the face;—such, too, arc epispadias, and hypospadias, or incomplete closure of the receptacle and ducts provided for the urine. From a like want of development, though the immediate effect is opposite, arise the conditions of imper- forate anus, or vagina. Other cases of congenital deformity are caused by local eacci’s of deve- lopment ; such as for instance, supernumerary toes and fingers. Others again arise from defects in the relative position of twin ova; so that one foetus becomes adherent to the other; or even becomes included within the body of the other. Of the causes and prevention of congenital deformities, it is not worth while to speak. Of the treatment of such as are capable of relief by surgical means mention will be made in PART 1V., in the chapter devoted to the organ in which each variety may occur. II.

In order to complete the view of general disorder.? produced by local injury or disease, it is necessary briefly to allude to convulsions, occurring in epileptic paroxysms. These are familiar in medical prac- tice, when arising from irritation of the gums, of the stomach, of the uterus, &c.; they also occur occasionally from some of the local affec- tions which custom has assigned to the surgeon. In particular, they may arise from spicula of bone growing from the inner surface of the skull; or from slight injuries to the skull which have left the bone unsound ; and especially from irritation of the urinary organs ; reten- tion of urine, renal calculus, and the like. In children, convulsions are apt to be produced by severe injuries of any kind. Into the symptoms and treatment it is not the author''s province to enter in this place. It will suffice to give the general rule, that in all obscure cases of convulsions, search should be made for excentric causes of irritation, and that the surgeon will do well most carefully to scruti- nize the urinary and genital system, and to recollect how frequently they are caused by the retention of bile and urea in the blood.

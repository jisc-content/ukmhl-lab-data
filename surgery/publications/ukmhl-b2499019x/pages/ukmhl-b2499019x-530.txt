DISEASES OF THE DRINARy ORGANS. 504 Puncture of the Bladder by the Rectu:« is performed by placing the patient on liis liands and knees, or placing him on his back with liis knees drawn up, and bringing him close to the edge of the bed, introducing the right fore-finger into the anus, and a long curved trocar and canula, by its side, then feeling for the distended bladder just behind the prostate, .and e.vactly in the middle line, and plunging the trocar into it—leaving the canula for four-and-twenty hours. The point of tlie trocar should be withdrawn slightly within the canula as it is being introduced into the anus. SECTION II. — FEUJIANENT STRICTURE.

But in old neglected ciises, the c.anal with the corptis ^poiipiosuvi around may become converted into a thick, gristly, cartilaginous mass several inches in extent. Out of ninety-eight specimens, lUr. H. Smith found the disease situated in the membranous portion in twenty- one, whilst in seventy-seven it was anterior to the triangular ligament, and chiefly either in the bulbous portion of the canal, or in front of it. The catise.i are repeated gonorrhcca, intemperance, and unhealthy con- ditions of the urine. St/mpUms.— In what may be called the^irs/ ^lope, the patient finds that he wants to make water oftener than usual,and that helms more or less uneasy sensation in the perin.-enm after doing so; he also notices that a fe1f- drops hang in the urethra, and dribble from him after he has buttoned up. Then he observes that the stream of water

AORTA.—ILIAC. G03 third, where it is covered deeply by muscles, it is an undecided point whether the wound should be dilated, cutting through or across the muscles to reach the bleeding point, or whether the lower end of the brachial should be tied. In the middle and inferior thirds of the fore-arm, this vessel may be readily exposed by cutting through the in- teguments and superficial fascia along the outer margin of the flexor carpi ulnaris for the extent of three inches. That muscle is then to be drawn inwards, the deep fascia to be divided, the veins to be separated from the artery, and the needle to be passed from within, so as to avoid the ulnar nerve which lies on the ulnar side. In wounds of the palm of the hand, with great hannorrhage, the wound should be dilated, and the bleeding vessels be tied, unless they lie too deepl}\ If that is the case, methodical pressure should be re- sorted to—the wound being cleared of coagula, and filled with lint (which may or may not be dipped in oil of turpentine), and firm pres- sure being made upon it, before and behind, in the manner described at p. 299. But if haemorrhage has recurred again and again, and the parts are inflamed or infiltrated with blood, the brachial artery should be tied just above the elbow. If an operation is required at all, it is better at once to do this, since the anastomoses are so numerous, that after tying both radial and ulnar above the wrist, the hemor- rhage maj" still continue tlirough the interosseal arteries. XII. The Aorta, the Common Iliac, and the Internal Iliac ’ arteries, may be tied by a similar operation. An incision from four to six inches in length must be made on the anterior surface of the abdo- men. It may either be made parallel to the outer border of the rectus, or to the epigastric artery—and it should terminate an inch above Poupart’s ligament. The three layers of abdominal muscles are to be cautiously divided to the same extent—and tlie fascia transvcrsalis

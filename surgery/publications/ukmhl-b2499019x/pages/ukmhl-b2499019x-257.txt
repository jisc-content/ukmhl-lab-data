SECTION V'll.—OF NON-UNION AND FALSE JOINT. There are some cases in which fracture of the shafts of bones does not unite by bone. This is liable to happen: — 1st. If the fractured part is subjected to frequent motion and dis- turbance ; in which case the effused lymph, instead of ossifying, will either be converted into a ligament which unites the broken extre- mities, or else a false joint will be formed ; the ends of the bones being covered w'ith synovial membrane, and surrounded with a liga- mentous capsule, as is well shown in the ad- joining figure from a pre- paration in the King’s College Museum. 2ndly. The repara- tive processes may be deficient if the vital powers are exhausted by age and debility; or if the system is under the influence of gout, syphilis, or cancer; or if an acute disease or fever comes on; or if the patient becomes preg- nant, and all the nutri- tive energies of the sys- tem are employed in the developement of the foetus; or if the part be deprived of its nervous influence. Thus Air. Travers relates a case in which a patient had a fracture of the arm, and of the leg, and likewise an injury of the back, which palsied the lower extremities. The arm united readily enough, but the leg did not. But yet there are some cases which it is as difficult to account for as it is to remedy. Treatment.—There are three indications; 1st. To bind up the part in splints, or the starched bandages, or to envelope it in a mould of plaster of Paris, so as to insure perfect rest, perfect apposition, and pressure of the broken ends against each other.

AKEUEISM. 307 lobes of the thyroid (jland may be distinguished from aneurism of the carotid by tlieir slipping up out of the fingers, along with the larjmx, in the act of deglutition. Gthly, Psoas abscess may be known from aneurism by the precursory pain and weakness in the back ; and b}' its disappearance when the patient lies down. 7thly, Pulsating tu- mours, composed of erectile or of malignant (/rowlhs—especially those connected with bone—are sometimes mistaken for aneurisms ; from which, in fact, it is hardly possible to distinguish them during life, since thej’' have the same kind of pulsation, attended with the same whizzing noise, and checked like that of aneurism, by pressure on the artery above. The mistake, however, is of no very serious conse- quence, because the ligature of the main artery, which would cure an aneurism, might check the growth of a tumour. Progress.—As an aneurism enlarges, its coats become thinner, but are strengthened by the adhesion of the parts around. As the en- Fig. 1.* Fig. 2. largement proceeds, these are gradually absorbed ; bone offers no resistance, but is absorbed as well; and at last the tumour reaches the skin and distends it. Inflammation succeeds ; the skin becomes red, then livid and vesicated ; and sloughs. When the edge of the slough sepai’ates, a fatal bleeding ensues; sometimes in a gush enough to destroy life at once, although more frequently the blood oozes away slowly. But an aneurism may burst into a mucous ainal; * Figure 1 exliibits a front, and the succeeding one a back view of an aneuiiem of tlie arch of tlie aorta, wliich burst into tlie tracliea. The opening into tlie .aneurism Irom the artery, and tlie letheroniatous patclios between tlio coats of the latter, are well shown. From Mr. Lane’s Mubeum.

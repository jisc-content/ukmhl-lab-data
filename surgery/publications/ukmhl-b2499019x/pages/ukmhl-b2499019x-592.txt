5G6 PART V. OF THE OPERATIONS OF SURGERY. CHAPTER I. OF OPERATIONS IN GENERAL. I. Tiir Av'’.\raTus necessary for operations in general comprises one or more Ijistouries, scalpels, or other specific cutting instruments; a dissecting forceps, a tenaculum, and small forceps (which should have a spring or catch") to take up .arteries; plenty of well-waxed ligatures, curved needles threaded, fine sponge, water both w.arm and cold, .and wine and hartshorn in case of faintness. There should also be a sufficient number of assistants—there should be one whose sole business it should be to administer the chloroform, and to watch its effects, and others to keep the patient in a proper position, to hand the different instruments to the surgeon, or to assist him in other respects—besides a good light, and a bed or table, with pillows or cushions to m.ake the patient’s position as convenient as possible. Mr. W. Fergusson gives the useful hint that it is desirable to h.ave delicate instruments made to shut in a h.andle like a pocket clasp-knife; so that they may be kept in the surgeon’s waistcoat-pocket till they are wanted, and that their edge or point may not be injured through the c.arelessness of the assistants. “ The temperature of cutting instruments should be raised,” s.ays ^I. IM.algaigne, “ to that of the body ; since cold metallic sounds pass with more difficulty into the urethra, and the r.azor cuts better after being warmed.” * II. Incision.s.—In making incisions, there are several points that demand attention. First of all, the manner of handling the knife, which, as systematic writers say, may be held either like a common dinner knife, or like a pen, or like a fiddle-stick. The first two positions are those which are employed commonly; the third is re- sorted to in cutting into the different layers over a hernial sac, and in * Malg.aigno's 0])crative Surgery, translated by F.

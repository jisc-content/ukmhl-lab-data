EXTRACTION OP TEETH. 431 JU ' ■ XII. Extraction of Teeth.—The instruments for extracting teeth are the forceps, the elevator, and the key. 1. The forceps is the instrument that is now generally employed by dentists. It should be made with sharp edges, so that it may be pushed up between the tooth and the gum, and should seize tlie tooth by its neck, close to the alveolus. For this purpose also, the jaws of the instrument should be made to incline towards each other in such a way, that they may slip up and embrace the neck of the tooth accurately when the handles are pressed together ; and they should be ground in such a manner that they may be adapted accurately to the shape of each tooth. For this purpose, the surgeon will require several sets of instruments. Two are required for the upper molars, one for each side, because of the third fang which projects inwards. Tlie adjoining figures show the manner in which they should fit the depressions and elevations of the tooth. One will suffice for the lower molars, both right and left, because they have only two fangs. One instrument will be necessary for the bicuspides and canines of the upper jaw, and another for those of the lower jaw ; and two sets will be necessary for the incisors of either jaw. In extracting teeth by the forceps, there are two things to be done; first to loosen the tooth, and then to pull it straight out. In extract- ing the incisors and canines of the upper jaw, they may first be loosened by giving them a gentle twist combined with a slight rock- ing motion, and then may be pulled perpendicularly downwards with a slight inclination backwards. The incisors and canines of the lower jaw are to be loosened by giving them a firm but gentle notion back- wards and forwards, and then may be pulled straight up. The bicus-

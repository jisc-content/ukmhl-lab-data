313 ANEURISM BY ANASTOMOSIS. SECTION IV.—OF ANEURISM BY ANASTOMOSIS AND N.EVUS. I.—Aneurism by Anastomosis is a pulsating tumour, generally situated in the subcutaneous tissue of the head or neck, or sometimes in the extremities. It is formed of several enlarged and tortuous ar- teries, whose coats are excessively thin; and ivhich are accompanied with many dilated veins, which feel like a bundle of worms. II.—N.EVUS is a similar affection, consisting apparently in an en- largement of very many small vessels, which form a kind of erectile tissue. It may either be seated in the skin itself, or under it in the cellular tissue; and occasionally is developed in bone. It is doubtful whether it is always a congenital affection, or whether it may be developed in after life. When in the skin it appears soon after birth as a small shining rod spot, dusk}', or scarlet, according as arterial or venous capillaries pre- dominate in its composition. In many cases it remains stationarj', and gives no further trouble; but more commonly it enlarges, and forms a soft pulsatory tumour, the skin covering which is so exceedingly thin, that profuse bleeding may occur from the slightest abrasion. The symptoms of large naevi, and of aneurism by anastomosis, are the same. “ Some of these tumours,” says Mr. Liston, “ communicate a thrill to the fingers; thej' can be emptied to a certain extent by uniform and continued pressure, or by inteirupting the circulation, and are instantly filled on permitting the blood again to flow into or • From a preparation in the King’s College Museum, allowing an enlarged and tortuous .artery.

The autlior says, page 5, “any fever may soon be extin- guished by the use of tlie following powders :—Take of tartarized antimony five grains; white sugar or nitre a drachm. Let tliem be well rublied in a glass mortar, and be divided into six powders; one to be taken evei-y three hours, notwithstanding the nausea the first may possibly occasion. If they bring on a dian'hcea they should still be continued, and it will soon cease. If these are taken (which is most commonly the case) without any manifest inconvenience, let there be seven giains in the next six powders, and in the next, ten. Here I beg leave to retract what 1 said in some former editions of this work: viz. that till sickness and vomiting was excited this noble medicine, was not to be depended on. For 1 have seen many instances wherein a paper has been given every three hours (of which there have been ten giains in six powdersi, without the least sensible operation, either by sickness, stool, urine or sweat, and though the patients had been unremittingly delirious for more than a week with subsultus tendinum, and all the other appearances of ha-stening lioath, they have iierfcctly recovered without any other medical aid, a clyster every other day excepted." * Made by .\lurray or Dinneford.

N^VUS. 31C Mr. Lawrence, in an aneurism by anastomosis on the finger. He divided all the soft parts, except the tendons and thecm. But in other cases it has been unavailing. If the disease is inaccessible to any of these means (as in the orbit), and increases rapidly, ligiiture of the common carotid (or of all the large trunks supplying it) is the only resource; but it is dangerous and not often successful. The adjacent figure represents a case of this disease, chiefly of a venous character in a female, about thirty years of age. Mr. Storks tied the common carotid artery, with the effect of producing a marked decrease in the tumour; and the patient having been subsequently admitted into the King’s College Hospital under the care of Mr. Fergusson, the remaining tumour was successfully treated with the needle and ligature employed as for the cure of varicose veins.* ♦ Vide Curling’s Pathological Lectures in Med.

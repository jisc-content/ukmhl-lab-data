197 PART IV. OF THE INJURIES AND SURGICAL DISEASES OF VARIOUS TISSUES, ORGANS, AND REGIONS. CHAPTER I. OF THE DISEASES OF THE CELLULAR TISSUE. SECTION I.—CARBUNCLE AND BOIL. Definition.—A carbuncle signifies an unhealthy inflammation and sloughing of a circumscribed portion of the cellular tissue. Symptoms.—It begins with a hard, circumscribed, livid red swell- ing, and with severe burning, smarting pain. Its most prominent part soon becomes soft and qumjgrj^ and numerous small ulcerated apertures form on it, which give exit to a thin discharge, compared by Sir A. Cooper to flour and water. These ulcers gradually unite, and form a considerable opening, from which a slough of cellular tissue is slowly protruded; and when that is separated, the parts may granu- late and he.al. The most usual situations of carbuncle are the back, the nape of the neck, and the nates. The tumour may vary in size from that of a half crown to that of a small plate. Causes.—Carbuncle is always an evidence of a vitiated state of the blood and disorder of the digestive organs; and it usually afflicts elderly people, whose health and spirits arc impaired bj' intemperance, or by hard study, or anxiety of mind. It sometimes appears to be the means by which some poisonous matter is thrown out of the system;* in cor- roboration of which idea, Sir B. Brodie mentions a case in which a car- buncle disappeared suddenly, and the patient began to sink and die at the same moment. It is often attended with considerable fever, and almost always with loss of appetite and flatulence. And it may be • Carbuncles, and unhealthy abscesses, are fretiuent consequoncos of what is called the watei- mrc; and the Genuan.s persuade tliemselves that they consti- tute a critical evacuation of diseased humours; but it is far more probable that they arc owing to the exhausted vitality of the skin, wliich is so inordinately taxed to relieve the system of the immense quantity of water witli wliich the blood is deluged.

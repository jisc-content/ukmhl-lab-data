DISEASE OF THE HIP-JOINT. 275 history of tlie case, the age of the patient, the absence of audible crepi- tation, and by the pain caused by pressing the ai'ticular sui-faces against each other; which is not a character of the chronic rheumatic affection. * Yct it must be remembered that this latter disease may lead to abscess if the patient meets with injury. The great pain caused by pressing the femur against the acetabulum will distinguish this disease from sciatica. Treatment.—This must of course be the same in principle as the treatment of other diseased joints. If the patient comes under treat- ment in the earliest stage, the limb should be maintained at 'perfect rest in the struipht posture, by means of a straight splint reaching from the axilla to the foot. If distortion has alread}' commenced, a bandage of leather or pasteboard should be applied; and the patient should not be permitted to lie constantly on the sound side, else the distortion of the spine and tlie chance of dislocation will be enhanced. Cupping or leeching, if there is considerable pain and tenderness, with strength sufficient, will be of great service in the early stages, and a course of mercury may be cautiously tried. But the principal dependence is to be placed on cod liver oil and tonics, and on counter-irritation by means of an issue behind the great trochanter, or at the anterior edge of the tensor vagina; femoris, or by a seton in the groin; and these measures should not be neglected, even though suppuration has com- menced. When abscess forms, it should be opened in the manner • Sketch of the patient from whom Mr. M. Smith removed the head of tlie thigh bone.

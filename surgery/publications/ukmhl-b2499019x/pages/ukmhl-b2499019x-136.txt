no MEDULLARY SARCOMA. left in its place a cyst containing a clear or coffee-coloured serum. Some portions of the mass are sometimes harder than brain, whilst other parts have softened into an almost diffluent pulp. Progress and Termination.—This tumour enlarges rapidly; and its arterial circulation is sometimes so vigorous as to cause pulsation like an aneurism. The skin covering it soon becomes purple or livid ; and the subcutaneous veins enlarged and tortuous. It is now subject to fits of aching or throbbing pain, but by no means so severe as that of schirrhus. At length one of the most projecting points ulcerates, and discharges a grumous fluid, — and a rapidly increasing fungus grows from the aperture. Sometimes this fungus exudes an enonnous quantity of a thin, colourless serum — sometimes it is covered with a slight crust of coagulum — sometimes its blood-vessels give way, and there is a profuse hasmorrhage—and sometimes large portions of it soften down or slough. The constitution suffers in the same manner as in scirrhus, but much more early and severely; and the patient ex- pires after a few months, worn out by the irritation of the external malady, and by its invasion of the viscera. This form of malignant disease has a special preference for the tes- ticle, lungs, kidneys, spleen, and meninges, and is the form which generally occurs in the earlier periods of life ; moreover, it generally takes the place of scirrhus, when the latter has been removed by excision. It occurs more generally in a distinct or tulcriform mass, than in the form of infiltration. Varieties. — The mammary sarcovia of Aberneth}", the miltlike tumour of Monro the youngest; and the solanoid and nephroid tmnours are varieties of this disease, deriving their appellations from their acci-

260 DISEASES OF THE very seldom attacks young children. The joint most frequently affected is the knee. Symptoms.—In the most acute form, the symptoms are severe aching pain in the joint, aggravated by the slightest motion; great swelling occurring very soon after the pain ; redness and tenderness of the skin; and fever, which is often violent and alarming. The swelling is peculiar, and is distinctive of the disease. It is occasioned by a rapid effusion of fluid into the sjmovial cavity; and, consequently, if the joint is superficial, it fluctuates freely. It is always most prominent at the points where the joint is least covered by ligament, and, consequently, the shape of the joint is always altered. When the knee is affected, the patella is protruded forwards, and there is a great fulness at each side of it, and at the lower and front part of the thigh. In the elbow, the swelling is most distinct .above the olecranon, and in the hip and shoulder there is a gener.al fulness of the surrounding muscles. Profjnosis.—This disease is much more serious when it affects one joint solely, and more particul.arly when it arises from local injury (especi.ally a penetrating wound), th.an when it .affects many joints, and arises from constitutional disorder. The danger to life in any case will be proportion.ate to the severity of the febrile symptoms, » Sketch of a patient alfected with acute synovitis of the right knee.

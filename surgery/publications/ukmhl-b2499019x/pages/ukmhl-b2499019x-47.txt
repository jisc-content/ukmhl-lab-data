•21 IITSTERICAL TETANUS. The time at which the disease appears is generally from the fifth to the tenth day after birth ; hence the popular Irish term nine-day fits. The symptoms are, locked jaw, spasmodic difficulty of breathing and swallowing, and general convulsions. They are almost invariably attended with diarrhoea, and preceded by fretfulness, startings diming sleep, and unusual greediness for the breast. Treatment of any kind is seldom successful; but it may be pre- sumed that the warm bath, four or five doses of calomel (gr. i.—ii,) at intervals of four or five hours, a teaspoonful or two of castor oil to clear the bowels, and minute doses of laudanum (one-eighth of a minim cautiously increased) every two hours afterwards, or chloroform, are the measures most likely to be of servico.(") Hysterical Tetanus.—It is one characteristic of hysteria, that it frequently assumes the more palpable outward sjnnptoms of various diseases, so as to simulate them pretty completely; although proper investigation may always detect the real features of hysteria, under an}' mask whatever. Thus an hysterical female may be seized with stiffness of the muscles of the face and jaws, which may extend to the neck, and gradually invade the trunk and limbs, so as completely to close the mouth, and render the whole body rigid and motionless. The chief points of diagnosis are, the hysterical state of the mind ; and the fact that the muscular contraction, however great, may almost always be overcome for the moment by forcing the patient to exert her volition. The best remedies are, warm aloetic purgatives, and turpentine enemata, and valerian, galbanum, and other antispasmodics of that class. (*) (*) Case of acute pleurosthotonos, Med.

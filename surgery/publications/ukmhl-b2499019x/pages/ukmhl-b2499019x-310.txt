â€¢284 DISLOCATION OP THE ELBOW. wastes away, owing probably to injury of the circumflex nerve. Violent spasms and neuralgic pains of the arm sometimes occur from injury to the other nerves ; and there are some cases in which rupture or displacement of the long tendon of the biceps is the source of continued impairment of motion ; and, together with displacement of tins tendon, the head of the humerus has been known to be partially dislocated upwards.* V' IV. Dislocation of the Elbow presents six varieties. Both radius and ulna may be dislocated, 1. simply backwards ; or, 2. backwards and outwards ; or, 3. backwards and inwards. 4. The ulna by itself may be dislocated backwards; and the radius by itself either, 5. backwards, or, 6. forwards. 1. W^hen both radius and ulna are dislocated lackmirds, the elbow is bent at a right angle, and is immoveable. The olecranon projects much behind ; a hollow can be felt at each side of it, correspond- ing to the great sigmoid cavity ; and the trochlea of the humerus forms a hard protuberance in front. The coronoid process rests in that fossa of the humerus which naturally contains the olecranon. 2. In dislocation of both bones backicards afid ontwards, the coro- noid process is thrown behind the external condyle ; and in addition to the preceding symptoms, the head of the radius can be verj^ plainly felt on the outer side of the joint. (3.) The dislocation backwards and inwards \s known by a great projection of the outer condyle, in addition to the sjTnptoms of the first variety. * See a paper By Mr. Stanley on Rupture of the Biceps Tendon, in the Loud. Med. Gaz. vol. iii.; and case of jmrtial dislocation of tlie humerus upwards, by Mr. Soden, in Med. Cliir. Trans, for 1841. Some morbid changes often attributed to injur)", such as atrophy or laceration of tlie capsulai" tendons, are more pro- t)al)ly produced by clironic rheumatic artliritis.

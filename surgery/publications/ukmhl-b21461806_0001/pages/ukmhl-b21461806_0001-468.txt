1 . „ , CPiOL^EMIA The mfluence of a chlorotic state of the blood in wh ch the fibrm is essentially deficient in quantity or defective m quality, as in scorbutus, hyperinosis, and many aflfect.ons resulting from the action of septic poisons. In chlorosis there is usually a sufficient quantity of organisable plastic exudation forheahngby the adhesive process/and, accordingly less tendency to suppuration, and a rarity of 14 morrhages, either active or passive ; this being due as remarked by Andral, to the fibrin remaining nor- ma although the corpuscles are diminished. Many Ovving to anemia being one of its most serious complications, loss of blood ought to be sedulousW guarded agamstin chlorotic subjects, and operations involving a risk of hemorrhage should, ifSwe be delayed until the blood has been ^stored to a healthy state. Iron is the appropriate remedy After I S employment for a few weeks the solid con- stituents have been found on analysis to be doubled and the red corpuscles nearly trebled.

These medicines are ancillary to iron in their operation. Iron, in some of its fbrms, shou d be steadily administered, and exercise with other Jiygienic measures enjoined. Friction of the sur- lace, or shampooing, is also a most useful auxiliary. After a few days treatment on these principles, the cheeks, hps, and gums, begin to regain their colour, and in a few weeks all the symptoms sub- side. On recurring to exhausting practices and delective hygienic customs, the patient is very apt to suffer a relapse ; as remarked by Van Swieten we are sometimes called on to repeat this course three or four times, even in the space of a year, belore the patient becomes obedient to rules.] rriTTrvT !r^,^r . Henry Ancdl. [CHOL^MIA. Biliary Rood. Jaundice.1 [A biliary condition of the blood may result from ---l _i he materials of bile being received into or formed 111 the blood in excess ; 2. A failure in the action ot the bile-secretmg cells of the liver ; 3. An ob- struction to the passage of the bile in its ducts, fol- lowed by the reabsorbtion of its constituents. These causes may operate simultaneously ; obstruction cannot continue long without producing a remora of bile m the ducts, modifying their calibre, and in- teriering with the function of the hepatic cells ; and excessive production of the elements of bile may co-exist with diminished secretion. In some indi- viduals there appears to be an habitual excess of the materials of bile in the blood, marking a pecu- J.ar temperament and rendering its subjects torpid wLn"f,!'P^'f-^ ''"'■''y •'^"'^ "'«"tal exertion.

Med. Rev. Jan. 1857 ) Jaundice may result from either of the patholo- gical conditions here described, but is not neces- sarily present when the blood is bilious. It con sists in an accumulation of colouring matter ren- denng the liquor sanguinis usually of a deep golden- yellow tmt ; the serum and clot, and the b Jy coat when formed, are tinged with the same colour Uwmgto the circulation of this liquor within theves- sels and the discolouration of the parenchymatous fluids, the skm, mucous and serous membranes.fibrous tissues, osseous part of the teeth, and even the hairs, lymphatic glands and brain, the secretions of milk sweat, sputa, urme, and of the serous membranes' and the pathological products of these membranes may be tinged yellow ; after a time all the free fluids and the more stationary solids become alike 'tII : ^ ""t^ 'P?"'™ exception being the enamel oi the teeth. In this condition of blood organic che- mists have detected the resin of bile, cholic acid, leucine and tyrosine (products of the decomposition ot albuminous substances), and an excess of chole- sterine and fatty matter generally; audit is proba- ble that other compounds usually removed by the secretory action of the liver may be detained in the blood, and that new compounds are often formed, as indicated by a bluish, greenish, or red- dish tint, superseding the pure yellow of bile pig- ment. In typhus fever and small-pox, leucine is detected in the blood, nitrogenous materials being probably converted into this substance instead of into bile and urea. The effects of choL-cmia on the system depend much upon the action of the skin and kidneys, winch perform a vicarious function, and act as safetj'-valves, the materials of the bile being de- tectable in the urine. The temporary re-absorption of bile, owing to obstruction of the ducts, although attended with jaundice, is not in general followed by such serious results as the retention of the biliary constituents in the blood. Some of these, as the resinous acids, are intended for absorption and for ulterior use in the sconomy, and the colouring matter is probably identical with that of the liquor sanguinis. The colouring matter in excess, and the resinous acids, have been observed in the blood without any train of symptoms. Absorption being gradual, the kidnej's have more power to prevent accumulation and the formation of new compounds.

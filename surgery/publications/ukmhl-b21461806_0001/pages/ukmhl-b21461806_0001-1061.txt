HYDKOPHOBIA. 1047 the tunica vaginalis, with a communication be- tween the cavity of this membrane and that of the peritoneum, which was not closed at birth. Wiien the patient is laid upon his back, the fluid returns into the belly, but descends again when the body is erect. Pressure will also cause the contents o( the tumor to recede; but this happens very gra- dually, and less quickly than the return of a hernia. The "opening of communication between the two cavities is generally small, but varies from the size of a probe to that of a goose-quill. {Sir B. Bi odie, Med. Giiz. vol. xiii. p. 89.) [In these cases it is difficult to determine whether the fluid is secreted in the abdomen or in the tunica vaginalis; since, if poured out by the peritoneum, it must naturally tend to accumulate in the more depending cavitj'. But as the fluid usually becomes absorbed after the communication between the abdomen and tunica vaginalis has been obliterated by pressure, it seems probable that the fluid is originally formed in the abdomen. {Curling, On the Testis.) In the treatment of this form of hydrocele the main object is to obtain the obliteration of the neck of the sac, so as to cut off the communication with the abdomen. This is accomplished by con- stantly wearing a truss, so made as to press firmly on the inguinal canal; and after adhesion has taken place the tuid usually disappears : its removal may be encouraged by the application of a stimulating lotion, or may be eifected by acupuncture. In early life this plan of treatment is generally suc- cessful; but should it fail after many months' trial the truss should still be worn, not only to prevent the passage of fluid from the abdomen into the sac, but also to impede the descent of a hernia, and to afi'ord a further chance of obtaining obli- teration of the opening. This form of hydrocele very rarely requires injection for its cure, and the operation, or even that of simple puncture, should never be performed unless the surgeon is fully satis- fied that a communication no longer exists between the sac and abdomen. If the sac be injected be- fore closure of its neck, peritonitis is very liable to ensue, and to endanger the life of the patient. {Curling, op. cit.)] Hydrocele in Women. [Closely resembling hydrocele of the tunica vagi- nalis in man is the congenital hydrocele of women, in which, by the collection of water in the perito- neal sheath of the round ligament, a swelling is formed, which passes through the inguinal canal into the lower part of the labium pudendi, and is at first returnable, but afterwards not so.] It is an exceedingly rare disease. The researches of Sacchi, Palletta, Scarpa, Monteggia, and Regnoli, prove that it is generally situated in the canal of Nuck, and may comnmnicate with the abdomen, or not. In one example of the kind, a cure was etfectod by Regnoli by incision. (See Revue Med. Oct. 1834.) Tliomas WaUci/, Jitnr. Monro, on the Tumors of the Scrotum, in the Edinb Med. Essavs, vol. v. .7.

This being for the most part a striking symptom of the fatal in- disposition which results from the bite of a mad dog, and some other animals affected in the same way, the disease itself has been named hydrophobia: some have used the more general term liygropliobia, from v-yphv liquid. But strong objection has been made to both these terms, because derived from a symptom which does not exclusively belong to the disease, nor constantly exist in it. The old writers, as we learn from Coelius Aure- lianus, used the terms aerophobia, or a dread of air, and pantehobia, or a fear of all things, since the impression of cold air sometimes excites terror, and the disorder is marked by a singular degree of general timidity and distrust. Others called it phobodipson (5ii(/os signifying thirst), because the patient is thirsty, yet fears to drink. Several modern authors, however, objecting to any appella* tion expressive only of one symptom, denominate the disease jabicB, and rabies canina, canine madncas, 3x4

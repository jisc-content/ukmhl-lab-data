120 AMPUTATION, which the pelvis is affected) may also require the performance of amputation at the hip-joint, as was recentlj' illustrated in the practice of Mr. Syme, and in tliat of Sir Astley Cooper. The case in which Mr. Carmichael amputated at the hip was what is termed an osteo-sarcoma: the patient, a gii'l, nineteen years of age, died on the fifth day. (See Trans, of the Kinr/'s and Queen s College of Phi/sicians, freland, vol. ii. p. 357, &c.; and vol. iii. p. 158.) Dr. Mott's case was one of fracture of the upper part of the femur, ending in disease of the bone and extensive abscesses. The disease for which Delpech operated was necrosis of the thigh bone. The propriety of the operation in desperate cases is now perfectly established. Thus, as M. Velpeau observes, a comminuted fracture, an osteo-sarcoma, a spina ventosa, any incurable disease of the femur extending above its shaft, gangrene, in short, any disease reaching to the vicinity of the hip, and so serious as to require the removal of the limb, are cases for amputation at this joint, provided the acetabulum and bones of the pelvis be unaft'ected. It is indispensable for gunshot wounds of the upper third of the thigh combined with fracture. (See A^owu. Elem. de Med. Opei: t. i. p. 516.) It was performed by Mr. Mayo for a neuralgic affection of a thigh stump. [Several of the more recent operations have been for malignant disease of the femur, and the question has arisen whether in all such cases it would not be better to amputate at the hip than in the con- tinuity of the bone already diseased. That the disease does return rapidly in the slump when the amputation is performed in the continuity of the bone is unfortunately too well ascertained. Three cases of this kind occurring to Messrs. C. Guthrie, Lloyd, and Prescott Hewett, are recorded in the Lancet for 1850 and 1851, and in all these cases the surgeons are stated to have expressed their regret at not having amputated at the next joint above the disease. But, as it is observed in that journal, it is doubtful whether there is a sufficient guarantee against recurrence in taking off the limb at the hip-joint, to justify the immediate risk of life incurred by this hazardous operation. (See Lancet, vol. i. 1863, p. 406.)] [Statistics ov Asiputations.] [It is to be regretted that all our large public institutions do not fm-nish regular returns of the results of their principal operations. Sucii returns, showing not only the mortality, but the causes of death, and the period after the operation at which it takes place, would be of the greatest possible value in determining many questions relating to the subject of amputation. In the absence of such sources of information, the following tables have been compiled from the principal statistical returns which have been pub- lished of late years. They produce, it will be seen, an aggregate of 5242 cases. Being derived from various sources, military and civil, from liospitals, both provincial and metropolitan, in this country, France, and America, and the cases having been subjected, therefore, to every variety of external influences, they may be supposed to afford a tolerably correct idea of the mortality after these operations. _ The following are the authontios whose re- searches have been made available for this pur- pose.

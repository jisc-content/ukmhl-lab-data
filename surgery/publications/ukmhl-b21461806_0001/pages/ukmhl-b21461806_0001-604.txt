^90 DURA of Amiens. It happened in a dragoon, in conse- quence of his horse falling with him and squeezing his foot against the ground. The toes were dislo- cated outwards, and the head of the first metatarsal bone escaped through a transverse wound on the inner side of the articulation. Reduction was at- tempted, but the protruding extremity of the me- tatarsal bone opposed an insurmountable resistance. It was therefore removed, and the bones could then be replaced with great facility, the outer toes re- suming their normal position almost spontaneously. The wound in the integuments healed, and at the end of seven weeks he was able to return to his duty, the great toe, strange to say, having pre- served all its movements. {Malgaigne, t.ii. p.1095.) Dislocation of the phalanges of the toes may occasionally occur, but from their diminutive size, and the mobility of the metatarso-phalangeal arti- culations, such an accident is very unlikelj'. The treatment required would be the same as in the fi"gers.] James R. Lane. MATER. BiBlioG. AND Refer.—On the subject of Dislo- cations consult A.

A double row of eyelashes' the innermost ones of which irritate the eye. The pseudo-cilia, which grow in distichiasis, seldom occupy the whole length of the eyelid ; but are mostly scattered about between the natural place ot the cilia and the Meibomian apertures. fSee Trichiasis.) DURA MATER, FUNGOUS TUMORS Ui'. The disease arises giaduallj-, in the form of a tumor, which makes its way through the bones of the cranium, and Insensibly blends itself with the integuments, which seem, as it were, to make a part of it. Fungous tumors of the dura mater may originate spontaneously at any part of this membrane ; but they are particularly apt to grow on the surface, which is adherent to the upper part of the skull, or to its basis. They are firm, indolent, and chronic, seeming as if they were the' consequence of slow inflammation, affecting the vessels, which supply the dura mater, and inoscu- late with those of the diploe. It is very difficult to determine whether the disease begins in the dura mater or the substance of the bone itself. The general belief, however, is that the bone is affected secondarily, and that the disorder originates in the dura mater. The patient, the subject of the first case related by M. Louis, imputed the complaint to a fall, which he had met with four of five months previously, and in which the head itself had not received any violence ; but, from this time, he ex- perienced a stunning sensation, which continued till he died. The cranium and dura mater were found both equally diseased. Though this case may tend to prove that fungous tumors of the dura mater may form spontaneously, yet, it is not the less confirmed by a vast number of cases, that this affection more frequently follows blows on the head, than any other cause. Hence, a slow kind of thickening of the dura mater is produced, which ends in a sarcomatous excrescence, the formation of which always precedes the destruction of the bone. In the memoir, published by M. Louis in the fifth volume, 4to. of those of the Royal Aca- demj' of Surgery, tliere is a very interesting case, illustrating the nature of the present disease. The subject was a young man, aged twenty-one, who had a considerable tumor on the left side of the head, which was taken for a Jiernki cerebri. (See i/ns Article.) The swelling had begun in the region of the temple, and had gradually acquired the magnitude of a second head. The external car was displaced by it, and pushed down as low as the angle of the lower jaw. At the upper part of the circumference of the base of the tumor, the inequalities of the perforated bone, and the pulsa- tions of the brain, could be distinctly felt. Some parts of the mass were elastic and hard ; others soft and fluctuating. A plaster, which had been applied, brought on a suppuration at some points, from which an ichorous matter was discharged. Sliiverings and febrile symptoms ensued, and the man died in less than four months, in the year 1764. On dissection, a sarcomatous tumor of the dura mater was detected, together with the des- truction of the whole portion of the skull, corres- ponding to the extent of the disease. When a tumor of this nature has decidedly

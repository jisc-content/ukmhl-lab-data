Surg. Mott's transl. vol. ii. p. 632.) ^ ^ A very ingenious instrument has been con- trived by Mr. Trant of Dublin, to effect a cure on De<:ault's principles, i. e. to restore the canal by pressing back the septum, but without the division or removal of any portion of it. One part of the instrument is made to press back the e'peron to- wards the spine, while another part retains the anterior wall of the intestine in close contact with the posterior surface of the abdomimal parietes, by which the danger of separating the delicate ad- hesions in this situation is prevented, which might otherwise cause a fatal extravasation into the cavity of the abdomen.

In one case related by Guattani the pa- tient recovered from the wound, a false aneurism, however, followed at the point of puncture, as discovered by a post-mortem examination several years afterwards. In the Journ. de Med. t. xlvi. p. 435, a case is described where a patient was wounded in the aorta just at its origin from the left ventricle, and where death followed on the sixth day. Another case is recorded by Lerouge, in which the wound passed through the right auricle and the aorta, notwithstanding which the patient lived till the eleventh day. {Recueil d'Observations CIdrurgicales de Saviard.)] The following case is recorded by M. Pelletan. In the month of Ma}', 1802, a young man was brought to the Hotel Dieu. In a duel, he had been rmi through with a foil, which penetrated above the right nipple, and came out at the left side of the chest. The most alarming symptoms were apprehended; but several days elapsed without any serious com- plaints taking place. The patient was bled twice, and kept on a very low regimen. Everything went on quietly for a fortnight. He now complained of severe pains in his loins, and he was relieved by the warm bath. He seemed to be recovering, got up, and went to walk in tlie garden allotted for the sick; but the pain in his loins quickly returned, attended with difficulty of breathing, constipation, and wakefulness. He now became very impa- tient, and out of temper with the surgeons for not relieving him. On the 15th of July, two months after the accident, a deformity of the spme was remarked, about the eighth dorsal vertebra. Ihe patient grew rapidly worse, and died m the ut- most agony, saying that he felt suffocated ; and tearing off his shirt that his chest might ba free from the pressure of all kind of clothing. On the body being opened, the right side of the chest was found full of blood, coagulated in various degrees; and an opening, the diameter of which was equal to that of a writing pen, was detected in the aorta above the crura of the diaphragm. A i .he adjacent cellular substance was injected with blood, and three of the dorsal vertebra were found carious. No mark of injury was perceptible in any of the thoracic or abdominal viscera. {Pelleian, Clinique Chir. t. i. p. 92—fli.) AORTA. iofTft, the principal systemic arterj. Aneurisms of this vessel have already been treated of: but some other particulars relating to it merit notice in a dictionary of surgery. Wounds of the Aorta. [The general opinion of surgeons is that wounds of this vessel are necessarily and instantly fatal. If the wound be of a size to permit the escape rapidly of a large quantity of blood, this result would of course be inevitable. Cases are recorded Thickening and Constriction of the Aort.\. Meckel met with two cases in which the aorta was thidcened and considerably constricted, just below its aixh ; yet, in botli subjects, there was every reason to believe that the abdominal viscera and lower extremities had been duly supplied with blood. This fluid, which could only pass Irom the heart with great difficulty, and in small quantities ad, by regurgitating, lacerated the semilunar V Ives. OWe»^ * I'Acud.

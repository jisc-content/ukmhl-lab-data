On this point all surgeons must, on reflection, be unani- mous. It IS one that I have always insisted upon in my surgical wntings, and it is one that is very properly defended by Mr. Amesbury.

The bad effects and painful consequences of having the vhole weight of the trunk operating upof the fmctured ends of the bone, which ar°e often not properly in contact, are too obvious to need any comment Yet this injudicious pressure was made in the position recommended by Pott, which « so forbids the use of long effective splints, and all assistance from moderate continued extension A fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone mav be complicated with a dislocation of the head of'the bone.

[Oblique fracture through the trochanter major without injury to tU neck of the hone.~ln this somewhat rare form of injury the fracture has an oblique direction downwards and inwards, so as to separate the upper part of the trochanter major, ogether with the head and neck, from the shaft of the femur Sir Astley Cooper has given several examples of this fracture ; in one of which the na- Pvnl- 1 ' '"-"T^ ''''^'^ ^y post-mortem examina 1011.

Cooper, the leg IS very little, and sometimes not at all, short- ened; the foot is benumbed; the patient cannot turn in bed without great difficulty and pain • in some cases the detached portion of the trochanter IS drawn forwards towards the ilium; in others, it lalls towards the tuberosity of the ischium ; but, in general, it is widely separated from that portion which remains connected with the neck of the bone, so that the finger may be placed between the fractured portions. The foot is considerably turned outwards, and crepitus is with diflicultv discovered if the trochanter is either much fallen or much drawn forwards. This fracture unites very firmly and more quickly than when the cervix is broken at the root of the trochanter, and the jiatient reco- vers with a very good use of his limb. (On Dis- locations, B. Cooper's cd. p. 175.) [Usually there IS little or no diminution in the length of the limb; but, says Sir A.Cooper, when the fracture happens DjIow the insertion of the principal rotatory mus- cles, the lower portion of bone is much raised by the action of the gbitanis maximus, and the limb becomes very much shortened and deformed at the place of union by exuberant callus. This allusion to the rotator muscles is not very intelligible ; the presence or absence of shortening is much more likely to depend upon the direction of the line of fracture. If this is very oblique downwards, the lilutaius maximus may readily draw upwards the slialt of the bone, wliilo if it passes more imcnrds, or at all approaches to the horizontal line, it will

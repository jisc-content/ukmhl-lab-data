According to Beer, dropsy of the eye is seldom entirely a local dis- ease, but at least ia generally combined with an unhealthy constitution, or is a mere symptomatic eflfect of some other dropsical affection, anasarca, hydrocephalus, &c. Sometimes, it appears as a symptom of chlorosis. On the other hand Mr. Lawrence informs us, that the facts which 'have come under his observation have not afforded the slightest support to the doctrine, that the disease owes its origin to a morbid state of constitution or requires the use of antihydropic remedies. (On Dis. of tlu3 Eye, p. 653.) Dropsy of the eyeball seems also to Mr. Middleraore to be a local defect not arising from constitutional causes, or meta- stasis. {0)1 Dis. of the Eye, vol, ii. p. 475.) The disease may originate either from a preter- natural accumulation of the aqueous humour; from that of the vitreous humour; or fl-om an im- moderate accumulation of both these humours together. (Juehre, von den Augenltr. b. ii. p. 616. Wein, 1817.) When the vitreous humour collects in this manner, it usually loses its natural con- sistence, and becomes thinner and more watery. {Richler, Anfanysgr. b. iii. p. 392.) It is sometimes conceived, however, that in ge- neral, dropsical affections of the eye " depend entirely on some local cause, which has operated, not so much in directly increasing the fluid con- tents, as in weakening the resisting power of the tunics of the eye-ball, and especially of the cornea and sclerotica.'' (See Mackenzie, On Dis. of the Eye, p. 627, ed. 2.) Beer states, that in the case proceeding from a morbid quantity of the aqueous humour, the first indication of the disease is an increase in the dimen- sions of the cornea, attended with a manifest en- largement of the anterior chamber. The cornea may become, in this manner, two, three, or even four times wider, than natural, without bursting, or losing its transparency ; for, though a turbid appearance is discernible, this depends rather upon the state of the aqueous humour itself. The iris, which, in the very commencement of the disease, begins to lose its mobility, soon becomes completely motionless, and acquires a duller colour ; the pupil always remaining in the mid-state between con- traction and dilatation. In the eyeball an annoying sense of pressure, tension, and heaviness is felt, rather than actual pain. In the beginning of the disease, there is a considerable degree of far-sight- edness, or presbyopia, which soon changes into a true amaurotic weakness of sight, but never termi- nates in perfect amaurosis. The free motions of the eyeball are more and more interrupted, in propor- tion as the organ grows larger, and it has invariably a hard feel, while the sclerotica, to the distance of two lines from the margin of the cornea, is as blue as it is in the new-born infant. Respecting the precise cause of the accumulation of the aqueous humour, Beer offers no observation worthy of repetition, excepting perhaps that in which he reminds us, that a similar collection hap- pens apparently as an effect of the conical staphy- loma of the whole cornea. (See also Wardrop's Essays on the Morbid Anatomy of the Eye, vol. v. p. 19.) Mr. Ijawrencc has seen dropsy of the an- terior chamber remain as an effect of internal acute inflammation which had destroyed sight. Long-con- tinued syphilitic inflammation of the cornea, is attended with increased secretion of the aqueous humour. After the termination of the inflam- mation, near-sightedness is produced ; there may be, however, a cloudy state of _ the cornea, and a corresponding imperfection of vision. Mr. Law-

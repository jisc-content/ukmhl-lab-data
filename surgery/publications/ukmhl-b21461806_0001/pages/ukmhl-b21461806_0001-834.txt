172 497 3 725 ^^20 GUNSHOT out by Mr. Guthrie aa demanding tlie early per- formance of amputation, and a deviation from the old rule of waiting till the mortification has ceased to spread. {On Gunshot Wounds of the Extremi- ties, p. 63, &c.) Secoiul case. Bad State of tlie Wound.—It often happens that, in gunshot wounds compli- cated with fractures, notwithstanding the most skilful treatment, the discharge becomes of a bad quality ; the fragments of bone lie surrounded with the matter, and have not the least tendency to unite ; the patient is attacked with hectic fever, and a colliquative diarrhcea. Under these circumstances, life may sometimes be preserved by amputation. [Secondary amputation may become necessary on gangrene _ setting in after ligature of a main vessel of a limb, or a vessel may be secondarily injured by a fractured bone where it maybe impos- sible to secure both ends of the bleeding vessel, and the heemorrhage cannot be arrested in any other way: in such a case, amputation must be had recourse to as a last resort.] _ Third case. Bad State of the Stump.—In hos- pitals, the cure of amputation is sometimes pre- vented by a fever of a bad character. The stump swells, the integuments become at first retracted, and then everted and diseased a good way upwards. The vyound changes into a fungous ulcer, the cica- trisation of which is hindered by the deep disorder of the bone and the ulceration of the soft parts. WOUNDS. The extremity of the bone projects. In order to remedy this last evil, it has been proposed to saw oif the projecting part of tlie bone, and, with this, even to amputate all the flesh beyond the level oi the skin. Larrey condemns such practice as uii necessary and dangerous, and he recommends giving nature time to bring about exfoliation. (Se;- Mim. de Chir. Militaire, t. ii.) Exceptions to this advice, however, are met with. [Larrey was of opinion that secondary amputa- tion, performed on the very first appearance of acute tetanus, or for the chronic form of that dis- order, checked the disease. One of his patient? recovered after undergoing the operation, and few other cases are recorded where beneficial results followed. This doctrine is, however, entirely re- nounced both by the modern French and English surgeons; and no one, that I am aware of, now re- commends amputation for the acute form of that malady. In certain, though rare instances, secondary am- putation may be demanded, where haemorrhage persists from a wound or compound fracture in which all other means have failed to restrain it. Styptics, pressure either on the wound, or compres- sion of the main artery, or ligature, ought to be resorted to previous to having recourse to amputa- tion; and this measure should only be adopted as a last resource for the preservation of the life of the patient. Such a case, I believe, only once occurred in the campaign before SebastopoL] [Return showing the number and results of Amputations in Non-commissioned Officers and Privates m the Crimean War, from 1st of April 1855 to the close of the War.] 'Shoulder-joint Arm ....

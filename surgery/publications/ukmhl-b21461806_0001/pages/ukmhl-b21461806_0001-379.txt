When the foDtus is contained in the womb, and cannot bo expelled, by reason of the invincible obstacles to which I have already referred, and embryotomy, or the practice of sacrificing the foetus and extracting it piecemeal by the vagina, be deemed improper, the Cfesarean operation should be practised before the mother and fcetus both perish from the violence of the pains, htemorrhage, convulsions, &c. For this purpose, it is necessary to make an ex- tensive incision in the integuments of the abdomen and in the uterus. All the opponents of the Ca:sa- rean Operation fear the hfemorrhage, which, they say, must follow. Indeed, if the uterus were not to contract sufficiently, when the foetus and after- birth had come away, the bleeding would really be perilous. But when the fcetus is extracted, to- gether with the placenta and meinbranea, the uterus contracts, just as it does after a natural labour. Besides, even when the mother is alive, the opo- ation is not commonly done till the uterus evinces a propensity to deliver itself, and begins to contract. The womb being delivered of its contents, the incision becomes closed, the vessels obliterated, and there is no fear of ha;morrhage. The wound must also make so irritable an organ more disposed to contract ,- but whatever arguments may be ad- duced, it is cnougli to say in this case: Artem acperieiilia fecit, crcmplo moiislrante viam. Roiisset, in 1851, published a work, in French, entitled. Jlysteiotomic, on VAvcouchcmcnl Cesaricn. Tin's book, in 1601, was translated into Latin, and en- Even T "PP^^di^l^y the celebrated Bauhin. E^en then, the practice of the Cajsarean operation on the hying mother had its defenders. Bauhin relates that, in the year 1500, a sow-gelder per- formed the Cesarean operation on his wife, iani fehcUer, ut ca posted, gemellos et qualuor ad hue in- jantes emxa fuerit. \ The possibility of operating successfully on the hving mother was proved with great perspicuity and accuracy by Simon. (See Mhnoues de I'Acad de Chirwyie, t. i. 4to.) But, if the life of the mother should not invariably be preserved the Cffisarean operation ought not to be rejected on this account; it ought always to be done when relief cannot be obtained by other means • just ia amputation and lithotomy are practised,' thoueh they are not constantly followed by success Would any tiling be more cruel than to abandon a mother and lier child, and leave them to p fsh i t uo t7/' ''"J"^ °f ««ving.them botlf J? is true hat when a pregnant woman dies of anv inward disorder, and not from the pains and efforts of labour, he fnetus is sometimes 'still alive in the uterus; but, in cases of death after difficult labou s and the great efforts mde by the uterus to om come the obstacles to parturition, the fc^U. is ^ ] n rally dead, and tlio operatior: therefore is 4s W«ly to bo availing. (See Bertrandi, Traitu del Operations de Chirurgie, chap, v.) It is the opinion of the best writers upon this subject that whenever a woman dies far advan ed m pregnancy, the performance of the CoDsarean

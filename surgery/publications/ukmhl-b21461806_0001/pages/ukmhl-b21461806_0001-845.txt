He passed a ligature through the piece of the mesentery corresponding to the two extremities of the bowel. These he reduced as far as the margin of the opening, which he had taken care to dilate ; and the dressings having been ap- plied, he awaited events. The first days were attended with alarming symptoms, which, how- ever, afterwards subsided. Those which depended upon the loss of the alimentary matter, suc- cessively abated ; and, after two months, the ends of the ileum were opposite each other, and dis- posed to become connected together. Larrey seconded the efforts of nature, and dressed the patient with a tampon, or sort of tent, that was occasionally employed for two months. The patient was then discharged firora the hospital quite cured. In several instances, says Larrey, the sigmoid flexure of the colon was injured, and yet the wounds were cured without any fajcal fistute. At the siege of Acre, three examples occurred ; and, at that of Cairo, two. Larrey dilated the entrance and exit of the ball. Clysters of the decoction of linseed, and emollient beverages, were frequently exhibited ; and the patients were kept on low diet, and in the most quiet state. [Wounds of the intestines sometimes remain fistulous for years, .and then close. Wounds of the stomach are followed by hic- cough, bloody vomiting and discharge of its con- tents, through the wound; they are very fatal. Baron Larrey calculates that foiu- or five only out of twenty, survive. Mr. Alcock states that only one recovered in the Spanish Legion. In some of the recoveries fistulous openings have continued for years,, or throughout life, as in the celebrated case of St. Martin. Wounds of the spleen are rare; Larrey only saw three cases in his extended experience. The danger arising from them is primarily from haemor- rhage ; and if the patient escapes this he may still succumb to fatal inflammation of the general peri- toneal cavity.] [Tables showing the nature and results of Cases treated in the British Army, from 1st of April 1855 to the end of the Crimean War.] Non-commissioned Officers and Privates.

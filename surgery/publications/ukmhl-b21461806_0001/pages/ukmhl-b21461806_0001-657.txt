During the seven years 1848-54, the entire and although it may afifect almost any part of the T T 2 body, the vicinity of the umbilicus is naturally the far most frequent seat. It soon spreads, especially to the genital organs and thighs, and produces vesication, suppuration in the subcutaneous tissue, and gangrene of the skin, if it be severe or phlegmonous. The constitutional symptoms are those of great debility, restlessness, whining, per- haps convulsions or coma. " The genital parts," say Drs. Maunsell and Evanson, "are not nn- frequently destroyed altogether ; and we have sometimes seen the scrotum become black and slough away, leaving the testicles bare and hanging loosely by the cords." So little, they add, spite of the intense mortality of the disease, are we justified in despairing of children under the most unfavourable circumstances, that we have seen a case recover after the whole scrotum and skin about the pubes had sloughed away, the bare testicles being again covered up by an extension and cicatrisation of the neighbouring integuments. (Diseases of Children, 4th ed. p. 223.) Of the cause of this affection, all observers speak with one tongue. Foul air, especially hospital air. It attacks chiefly children born in lying-in hospi- tals, and comes, say Drs. Maunsell and Evanson, at periods when other malignant diseases, as diffuse inflammation, puerperal fever, scarlatina, &o. prove the constituiio anni to be of a typhoid character. The treatment is that of erysipelas generally, modified to suit the age and feebleness of the pa- tients. In the first place, as in all other cases, re- moval to a pure air is essential, and the utmost cleanliness of clothes and person. The navel should be dressed with an unguent of the nitrate of bismuth and glycerine, which will eifectually ab- sorb any putrid matter. Good breast milk should be supplemented by occasional teaspoonfuls of beef-tea and port wine and water. The practitioner may relieve the bowels by enema, and if he can do it without neglecting nourishment, may give tonics, of which the liquor cinchoiiceJlavx of Battley, in the dose of a drop or two in sweetened water, is the best. Half-grain doses of quinine are recom- mended by many.] [Ery.sipelas, Statistics of.—The materials for this branch of our subject are either entirely want- ing or very imperfect. The following brief notes may, however, be of interest. The proportion which erysipelas bears to the total sickness of the whole population is unknown ; but we may refer to the returns published by the me- tropolitan medical officers of health, during parts of the years 1857 and 1858. These returns were Bet on foot in the hope that they would prove a record of the amount of sickness, and of its nature, amongst that large part of the population which receives medical attendance gratuitously, whether from parishes, or from dispensaries, or within the •wails of hospitals, and other charitable institutions. The project was abandoned at last, from the im- possibility of obtaining the required information with sufficient regularity and completeness. But, from the returns that were published, it appears that during the last forty weeks of 1857, and the first forty of 1858, out of 7.01,506 cases of illness, there were 2649 of erysipelas. This is more than three times the number returned of cases of small- pox ; and is nearly equal to the number of cases returned of acute pneumonia and pleurisy com- bined. mortality, in England and Wales, from ery- sipelas was 14,950, There were thirty-eight other diseases more fatal. In 1855 the deaths were 2256. In London, during the years 1844-58, 5768 deaths occurred from erysipelas, being at the rate of 384"4 per annum. The highest mor- tality was 579, in 1848 ; the lowest, 299, in 1857. Deaths jfrom erysipelas are evidently not on the increase. With regard to the seasons, Mr. P, H. Bird (in the pamphlet in which he gives a summary of his Jacksonian prize essay) says that 260 cases oc- cm-red in the following order:— Spring, 66 ; summer, 49 ; autumn, 56 ; winter, 89. He quotes from the Registrar-General also, to show that during the years 1845-54, the total deaths in London were :—Spring, 1117 ; summer, 972 ; autumn, 875 ; winter, 107G. Out of Mr. Bird's 260 cases, the deaths were 7-5 per cent. Dr. W. H. Stone (Med. Times, Nov. 12, 1859) states that the mortality of erysipelas in St. Thomas's Hospital is 7 per cent. Of 260 cases of erysipelas ambulans observed by Fenger, in the Frederick Hospital, at Copenhagen, 33 died, or 12-S per cent.; of 194 cases of erysipelas vulgaris, there were 2 deaths ; taking the 454 cases of both kinds together, the mortality is 77 per cent. Assuming 7 per cent, as the mortality, it is probable that, in 1857, there were 2100 cases of the disease in London. Out of 217 of Fenger's cases, 198 arose within the hospital; 17 idiopathic, 200 traumatic. Of the 200 traumatic, 140 cases followed surgical opera- tions. In this hospital, at Copenhagen, erysipelas seems, of late years, to have taken the place of hos- pital gangrene, which ravaged it previously. Puer- peral fever has been prevalent throughout in the ad- joining lying-in hospital. The sexes, notwithstanding the greater liability of the male to traumatic diseases, die equally of erysipelas. In the seven years 1848-54, the males who died were 7464 ; the females, 7486. Respecting the ages— Males, under 1, 1725 ; 5, 2100; 5 to 15, 290 ; Females, „ 1, 1805 ; 5, 2363; 5 to 15, 278. After these ages, the mortality in each sex is distributed pretty equally during each succeeding decenniad ; but with an evident rise, as age in- creases. Between 55 and 65, 884 men, and 816 women died of erysipelas.] (R. Driiilt.) ERYTHEMA (from ipvBph, red). A red- ness of any part. A mere rash or efflorescence, not nccpmpanied by any swelling, vesication, or fever; circumstances which, according to Dr. Bateman, distinguish it from erysipelas. {Synopsis of Cuta- neous Diseases, p. 119, cd. 3.) Its six varieties are described in the latter work. For the ery- thema mercurialo, see jyiet'cury. The term is often wrongly applied to eruptions, attended with red- ness, and distinct papular and vesicular ele- vation, as wo see in the instance of mercurial erythema, which Dr. Bateman says should be named eczema. ESCHAR (from i(rxapou, to form a scab, or crust). This term is applied to a dry crust, formed by a portion of the solids deprived of life by the action of concentrated heat. When any living part

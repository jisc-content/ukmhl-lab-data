The plan succeeds but seldom m animals ; dogs, for instance, whose blood 3S more plastic. On one hand, the adhesion of the parietes of the artery together is so feeble for the tirst live or six hours after the operation ; and, on the other, the clot is so small, that the impulse of the blood and the disturbance of extracting the thread will destroy one and displace the other." (bee P. J. Manec, De la Ligature, 4-c. p. 30 ) If ever the practice, however, should merit revival I invite the attention of the profession to the simple invention proposed by Mr. John Barker, of Ipswich tor loosening and removing the ligature. (See Aneurism.) ^ It appears, then, that the first effects of a lica- inteinal and middle coats, the bringin.. of its .vounded surfaces into contact with each other, and an obstruction to the circulation of the blood through nant blood, just within the extremity of the arter/; but this does not, in every instance, immediately form a coagulura capable of filling up the canal of the aitery. In most cases only a slender coagulura IS formed at first, which gradually becomes larger by successive coagulations of the blood; and hence the coagulum is always at first of a tapering form, with Its base at the extremity of the artery^ But as Dr. Jones remarks, the formation of this coagu- lum is not material ; for, soon after the ligatSre has been applied, the end of the artery inflames and the wounded internal surface of its canal' being kept in close contact by the ligature, adheres mid converts this portion of the artery into an im- pervious and, at first, slightly conical sac. It is to the efl^used lymph that the base of the coagulura adheres, when found to be adherent. Lymph is also effused between the coats of the artery/and among the parts surrounding its extremity. In a ttle time the ligature makes the part on which it IS directly applied ulcerate; and, acting as a tent, a small aperture is formed in the layer of lymph effused over the artery. Through this aperture a small quantity of pus is discharged, as long as the Jigature remains ; and, finally, the ligature itself also escapes, and the little cavity which it has oc- rnn"r^^r?'^''' and fills up, and the external wound heals, leaving the cellular substance a little beyond the end of the artery much thickened and indurated.

Every part of an artery is organised in a similar manner to the other soft parts, and its coats are susceptible of the same processes of adhesion, ulcera- tion, &c. as the latter parts are. Hence, the pre- cautions taken to secure the adhesion of other parts, should be observed for the same purpose, with regard to an artery. The vessel is put in a state to admit of adhesion by the ligature, which, when properly apjiliod, cuts through its interiinl and middle coats, keeps their cut surfaces in con- tact, and affords them an opportunity of uniting by the adhesive inflammation, as other cut surfaces do. The immediate stoppage of the bleeding is merely

[These injuries are judiciously classified under three heads; first, those that concern the abdominal walls only, without penetration of the cavity; secondly, wounds of the parietes opening into the cavity, but without implicating any of the viscera; and thirdly, penetration of the cavity, complicated with lesion of one or more of the hollow or solid viscera. It is not essential to every case of wounded or injured viscera that it should necessarily be ac- companied by perforation or other lesion of the abdominal walls; many instances are recorded of laceration of the liver, or spleen, or rupture of the intestine, where the parietes of tlio cavity were but little, if at all, injured. Four fatal cases oc- curred from rupture of viscera without external wound, before Sebastopol; in two of these there was rupture of the liver, one of the spleen, and one of the intestines. The muscul.ar portion of the walls of the abdo- men, according to Mr. Guthrie, are subject to absorption after a severe bruise from gunshot in- jury, rendering the portion liable to rupture; the division of its walls by a sharp cutting instrument is attended by the same consequence, and it never fails to occur after a bullet wound which has pe- netrated the cavity. {Commentaries of Surgery, edit. 6, p. 535-6.) No case of ruptured muscle, followed by atrophy and protrusion of the abdo- minal contents, is recorded in the returns from Sebastopol. Musket-lialls, impinging' obliquely against the wall of the abdomen, are doscribetl as sometimes making a circuit round tlio outside of the cavity, either between the skiu and muscles, or in the in- terval between the latter and the peritoneum; tliis deflected and circuitous route of the missile seems to have been produced more frequently by the old spherical bullet than is the case with tlie

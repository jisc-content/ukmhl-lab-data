The pathology of the blood will be found a very important addition which has contributed to augment the pages of the work. This subject in its entirety has been undertaken by Mr. Ancell, whose competency to the task is well established by the publication in the year 1841-42 of his "Lectures on the Physiology and Pathology of the Blood," which with the contemporaneous writings of Andral, Stevens, Piorry, Coi^land, and others, unquestionably influenced the progress of Medical and Surgical Science and the direction it subsequently took. At the period of the publication of the last edition, but slight account had been taken by surgeons of the blood as a vital constituent of the animal frame, or the seat of either the material elements, or the dynamic actions which enter into morbid processes. But at the present day, in every department of surgical practice, the question of the actual state of the blood must be entertained before any case can be fully compassed or rational indications of treatment, whether by operation or otherwise, can be laid down. Under these circumstances, the duty of the editor would appear to be to present to the surgical pi'actitioner and the student a fair summary of all that is known on the subject. The accom- plishment of this has been attempted in the Articles—Blood, Pathology of — Cholmmia — Hydrccmia—-Ilyperinosis—Hypinosis—Hetcrocltymeusis — Hypercemia— Oxalaimia —Nccrcemia — Pycemia — Toxmmia—F,pan- cemia, Urcemia, Sfc. Some of the articles have been through the press for a considerable period, but the writer has contrived eo to arrange the materials that, under the various headings above specified, will be found comprised a sufficiently complete view of the actual state of our know- ledge of the pathology of the blood. The plan adopted in conducting the present edition through the press has been, to retain as much as possible of the original matter.

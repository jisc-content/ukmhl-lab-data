In ague, BLOOD, SUPERALKALINE. 341 in the blood of the dead bod)', have been seen in abundance in that obtained from the prick of a finger. {Brit, and For. Rev. Oct. 1854.) In various diseases they have been observed, in the state of black, or occasionally brown-yellow, brown, or very rarely red, granules or flakes. They are united together by a clear hyaline substance; and, in rare cases, pigment-cells occur. In all the cases investigated, they were found in the blood of the heart, and sometimes in other organs, as the liver, and especially the spleen. The capillaries appear to be sometimes choked by them ; and especially they have been observed blocking up the cerebral capillaries — the finest in the body {KoHiker)—to the extent of giving a dark slate-grey aspect to the grey substance, and sometimes producing puncti- forin hemorrhages. They appeared to be some- times outside the vessels, and between the cells; and have been observed also both within and ex- ternal to the vessels of the cortical substance, and in the Malpighian capsules of the kidneys, in the lungs, and in the lymphatic glands. This pathological condition has been observed in intermittent fever and diseases of the spleen, in patients who have died comatose or paralytic, some- times with and sometimes without fever; in cases of albuminuria, in dropsy without kidney disease, and in cases where the patient died of some disease which appeared to be totally unconnected with the existence of such a substance. In many cases the patients have died suddenly with cerebral or ty- phoid symptoms. Little notice has been taken of this condition of the blood by our own pathologists ; but the readers of this work will not fail to collate some of the above facts with those recorded by Dr. Kirkes and Mr. Paget relating to the passage of minute coagula into the capillaries.

This may arise from an in- sufficient supply, or a defective formation of, acid constituents ; or it may be produced by the too rapid and complete oxydation of the acids, leaving the alkaline bases in excess. The blood may be- come alkaline also from the retention and oxidation of effete nitrogenous substances, which are con- verted into ammonia or its carbonate. Excessive alkalinity is inferred from an alkaline condition of the urine, the cutaneous excretions, and the pul- monary exhalations ; by the blood corpuscles often being crcnate, or otherwise misshapen, deficient in colour, and irregularly agglomerated, and in several cases partially dissolved; and by the blood being more fluid than usual. It may be produced by the use of alkalies. Dr. Bostock examined the serum of the blood of a young lady who had taken soda in excess for a considerable time, and found it much more alkaline than ordinary, from an unusual quantity of uncombined alkali. (Med.- Chir. Trans. vol. v.) In diseases attended with loss of appetite and abstinence from food, and when the body is ex- hausted by fatigue and abstinence, the alkalinity of the blood has a tendency to excess, owing to the acids being, for the production of animal heat, oxi- dised more rapidly than their bases arc excreted. When the kidneys fail to aecieto urea, this sub- stance is converted, by oxidation, into carbonate of ammonia, and may thus render the blood alkaline % 3

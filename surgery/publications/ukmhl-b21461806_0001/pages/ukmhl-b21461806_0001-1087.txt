When active, with increased action of the heart and arteries, and accumulation . of blood in the cerebral vessels, it produces a I flushed countenance, pressure on the encephalon, vertigo, somnolency, and loss of consciousness when mechanical, from obstruction to the return of blood and distension of the veins-the weak action ot the heart and arteries at the same time even dimi- nishing the flow of blood-it still produces pressure on the brain and a similar train of symptoms- and passive hyperajmia, from poisons, produces similar effects, from the slightest vertigo to the most pro- found coma. Partial hyperemia of the brain or spmal cord may coincide with either morbid ex- citement or paralysis, or the suspension of the func- tion of one part and the excitement of that of another, with many diseases referrible to the cerebro-spinal axis, as epilepsy, spinal irritation, Hysteria, hallucinations, and errors of sense and motion. The results of hyperemia are as multifarious as Its causes, varieties, and symptoms. They depend on its nature, seat, extent, duration, the condition ot the blood, and not only upon the organ, but the particular part of the organ affected. When It constitutes only an increased supply of healthy blood, as already stated, it promotes nutrition, secretion, and healthy function. Thus, in a marked manner, it increases the growth of hair and of the nails, the nutrition and power of the muscles, and the elongation of bone. It promotes also the heal- ing of wounds. It is right to state, however, tiiat It has recently been maintained byVirchow thathv- perremia alone does not exercise a direct regulating influence on nutrition. When produced artificially for days, weeks, or months, by section of the sjTnpathetic in the neck, no nutritive disturbance arises necessarily therefrom. A greater quantity ot blood in a part promotes the attraction of a larger quantity of material from the blood, but according to the pathologist last quoted it is not thereby compelled to take up more; for this purpose. It 18 essential that the part itself should exist 111 a particular state, as of increased activity or irritation, or that specific substances should be present in the blood, upon which definite parts of the tissues are able to exercise a particular at- 1 f^"''. f important considerations' re- lating to hypera:mia, however produced is th ft tL current of blood being retarded^:™:'3 d^S degree, not only do the corpuscles accumu ate and become grouped together, taking on a retrograde and oscillating motion, and displacing the paf ctal layer of the liquor sanguinis, as already Mated but the latter fluid becomes denser from (ransi da tion of Its more iquid portion; delicate, transparent fibimous coagula form, by which th'e coJusc£ are impacted, and a stasis or stagnation of blood occurs. This stasis may lead simply to coag ilatkin particu arly in passive and mechanical hypSks' as in the case of aneurism or tiie ligature o an artery, or as sometimes found in h^eniorrhidos; bu .n active hyperfcnua it has two most impo tan flYPER^MU. 1073 mrvZf.r^" r constitutes a pri- niaiy leature in local innammation (see Inflam- "nT^iir it r^'-d to inflamm - tion of the blood or inflammatory fever Cseo HvfERiNosis). The moment the blood becomes stagnant in a congested part transformations occur especially in the liquor sanguinis. Its condition having previously been that of health, the form-itiv^ process is exalted and oxygenation probably i„ creased; in an unhealthy state combinations of a totally heterogeneous nature are generated. Hence the exudations which follow differ from the nutri- tive bhistemata, and also, in the various forms of hypera3mia from each other.

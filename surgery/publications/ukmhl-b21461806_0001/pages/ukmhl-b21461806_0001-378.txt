366 CESAREAN OPERATION. Med. Cliir, Trans, vol. ix. and xi. &c.) Dr. Miiller, of Lowenburg, in Silesia, performed the Csesarean section, and saved both the mother and the child. (^Magazin fur die gesammle Heilhmde, 1828 ; b. 28, p. 146.) An instance of similar success is reported by C. H. Graefe. {Journal fur Chirur- gie, ^c. b. 9, s. i.) Two cases occurred in which both women and children were saved, at the hos- pital of Maestricht, by M. Bosch. {Bill. Med. 1823.) And in a valuable periodical work one example is reported from Hufeland's Joiurnal, where the mother and twins were all saved by the operation. (See Quarterly Journ. of Foreign Me- dicine, S(c. vol. iv. p. 625.) The most extraordinary case of Ctesarean oper- ation on record, is one performed by a negro-girl on herself, who recovered. (See Neio York Med. a?id Physical Journ. March, 1823.) Dr. Mosely mentions the case of a negro-woman at Jamaica, who opened her side with a butcher's knife, and extracted a child, which died of locked jaw. The woman recovered. (See Ryan's Manual of Mid- wifery, p. 280.) In England, the operation has been attended ■with remarkably ill success; no doubt tlie reason of this was correctly explained by Dr. Hull : — " In France," he says, " and some other nations upon the European continent, the Ceesarean operation has been, and continues to be, performed, where British practitioners do not think it indicated ; it is also had recourse to early, before the strength of the mother has been exhausted by the long continuance and freq[uent repetition of tormenting, though un- availing, pains, and before her life is endangered by the accession of inflammation of the abdominal cavity. From this view of the matter we may reasonably expect that recoveries will be more frequent in France than in England and Scotland, where the reverse practice obtains, And it is from such cases as these, in which it is employed in France, that the value of the operation ought to be appreciated. Who would be sanguine in his expectation of a recovery under such circum- stances as it has generally been resorted to in this country, namely, where the female has laboured for years under malacosieon {moUiiies ossium), a dis- ease hitherto in itself incurable ; where she has been brought into imminent danger by previous in- flammation of the intestines, or other contents of the abdominal cavity ; or been exhausted by a labour of a week's continuance, or even longer?" Dr. Hull thus refutes the opinion of Mr. W. Sim- mons that our ill [success was owing to climate or some peculiarity in the constitution of the fe- males of this island. (See Jluirs Defence of the Ccesarean Operation, p. 10.) The general readiness of Continental practitioners to have recourse to the Csesarean section, has been sometimes censured, because they have even oper- ated in cases, in wliich the patients had previously borne children in the natural way. According to Dr. Ryan, however, there are but four such cases on record : —" One by Nagele, in his Erfahriin- gen mid Ahhamll. aus dem Gebiete des Krankheitcn des Wciblielicn GcschlecMs; another by Hender- son, in the Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ. No. G6 ; a third by Meier, in SicboWs Journ. ; and a fourth in the same Journal by Bergen." (See Iiyan''s Manual of Midwifery, p. 279.) Certainly, if a woman had already borne children in the natural way, the fact should bo received as a strong argu- ment against the necessity of the operation, but perhaps not as an absolute prohibition, since every- thing must depend on the actual dimensions of the lower aperture of the pelvis in relation to the size of the existing foetus. [Dr. Fleetwood Churchill has collected the sta- tistics of this formidable operation with extreme care, and has tabulated the successful and unsuc- cessful cases occurring in England and America up to the date of the third edition of his Theory and Practice of Midwifery, published in 1855. The result of these tables shows that out of C3 cases 18 mothers were saved and 45 lost, or nearly three fourths. Out of 60 cases where the result to the child is noted, 34 were saved and 26 lost, or I in 2i. Dr. Churchill also collected from foreign autho- rities 371 cases, out of which 217 mothers reco- vered and 154 died, or about 1 in 2^. Out of 189 of these, where the result to the child is given, 139 were saved and 50 lost, or nearly one lourth. In a note he refers to eleven additional cases out of which six mothers were saved and five lost— eight children saved and three lost. Figueira records 720 cases of Cffisarean operation, of these the recoveries amounted to 366, the deaths to 424. Kayser gives the result of 339 cases ; 129 were saved and 210 lost. Dr. West collected 409 cases, of which 158 recovered and 251.died. The result to the child is stated in 347 of Dr. West's cases, to be deaths 110, recoveries 237. Dr. Merriman records 26 cases, 2 mothers were saved, 24 lost; 11 children recovered, 15 were lost. The mortality in each of these collections of cases differs considerably, but a tolerable close approxi- mation to the proportion of deaths to recoveries both as regards the mother and child will be ob- tained from the annexed tabular view of the whole.

If each author, however, has impartially reported the cases which came under his notice, the result will not be much vitiated by the repe- tition. As regards tlie mothers they give a mor- tality of 55-4 per cent. As regards tlie children, of 29-45. , . , • Kayser gives the mortality to mothers m hospi- tal practice as 79 per cent. Dr. West estimates the mortality to the mothers as high as 83 per cent. It is a remarkable fact that some >yomcn have undergone this operation several tunes. Dr. Churchill has given the following table of twenty- eight such cases.

374 CAMPHOR tlie Ceesarean operation being done, in cases of extra uterine foetuses, so as to save both the mother and infant. This eminent man condemned oper- ating in ventral cases, on the ground that the placenta could not be separated from the viscera, to which it might adhere, or, if left behind, the subsequent inflammation and suppuration would be mortal. (See Traiit des Oper. de Chir. chap, v.) Ruth, a surgeon in Upper Silesia, perfomied the Ctesarean operation successfully in a case of extra- uterine pregnancy of some years standing, during which period the woman became pregnant in the usual way, and was safely delivered. (See Graefe und Walt/ier's Journ. part 3, vol. vi.) The par- ticulars, which are well deserving of the attention of obstetric practitioners, may also be found in one of our own periodicals. (See £:dmb. Med. and Surg. Journ. vol. xxiii. p. 429.) Whenever the Caesarean operation, or gastro- tomy, has been performed, the practitioner is not merely to endeavour to prevent inflammation, heal the wound, and appease any untoward symptoms which may arise ; lie should also prevail upon the mother to suckle the child, in order that the lochia may not be too copious ; and, after the wound has been healed, she should wear a bandage, for the purpose of hindering the formation of a ventral hernia.

Calculi form in the kidneys, bladder, prostate gland, urethra, gall-bladder, &c.; also in the ducts of the salivary glands ; and in the laclirymal sac. (See Graefe's'Journ. fiir die Chir. No. i.

CALLUS, New-bone, or the osseous substance which serves to unite the ends of a fracture. The process by which it is formed, and the dilTerences between the provisional and the definitive calli, will be explained in the article Fracture. CALOMEL. (Hydrargyri chloridum, P. L. 1836 and 1851. Hydrargyri submurias, P. L. 1824.) Its extensive utility in surgical diseases will be conspicuous in a large proportion of the articles in this work. When prescribed as an alterative, the common dose is a grain once or twice a day ; when ordered as a purgative, from three to eight grains may be given ; and when directed with the view of exciting salivation from two to four grains, conjoined with opium, are usually administered night and morning, and in urgent cases, like iritis, sometimes oftener, till a full impression is made on the salivary glands, and system at large. (See Mercury.) [Calomel is also an excellent local application to condylomata (raucous tubercles) about the anus or vulva. The dry powder should be sprinkled freely on the surface of the affected parts.] CAMPHOR. Is used externally, as a stimu- lant, and as a means of e-xciting the action of the absorbents, and thus dispersing many kinds of swellings, extravasations, indurations, &c. Hence it is a common ingredient in liniments. It has also the property of rousing the action of the nerve.'; and quickening the circulation in parts on wh'ch it is rubbed. For this reason, in paralj'tic afioc- tions, it is sometimes employed; It is thought to accelerate the absorbent action of mercurj' ; feu- applications have greater power in exciting the ab- sorption of any tumor or hardness than camphorated mercurial ointment. Camphor has also been recommended for tlic relief of strangury, even that depending on tiie operation of cantharidos. The experience of its effects, however, has been somewhat contradictorv :

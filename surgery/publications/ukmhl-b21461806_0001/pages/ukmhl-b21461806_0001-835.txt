Many of them are superficial, affecting only the scalp; and when this is extensively torn and stripped from the bone, it becomes a severe, if not a dangerous, injury. But very commonly the bone itself is fractured and even depressed, and the membranes become sepa- rated from the bone or lacerated, and the brain itself implicated. Bullets liaving little velocity fracture and depress a circumscribed portion of bone; with greater velocity they perforate, and even pass out again, very often extensively frac- turing the cranium in doing so. The danger of these latter injuries is due more to the lesion or disturbance of the brain and. its membranes than to the mere fracture of the bone itself ; and this danger may be primary, owing to extravasation of blood, or to a portion of the skull having been forced inwards, thereby compressing the brain ; or serious symptoms may be excited by the lodgment of a part or the whole of the missile, or by spicula of bone, or other foreign substance which the ball has carried in along with it. The secondary evils to be apprehended arise either from inflammation of the membranes or the substance of the brain itself. Gunshot injuries in this region diiTer from those occurring in civil life, inasmuch as their most fre- quent seat is at the upper, lateral, anterior, or poste- rior parts of the skull, while those produced in civil life, most generally arising from falls, affect the base. Bullets perforating the brain, or penetrating and lodging deeply in it, are almost always attended with fatal results. Some extraordinary instances of recovery are related by Larrey and by Mr. Guthrie, both after removal of the ball and without. {Com- mentaries of Surgery, edit. 6.) These injuries are so fully treated of in the article " PIead, Injuries of iJie,''' in which the subject of gunshot wounds is included, that I refer the reader to it for more detailed information, and for the treatment, and content myself with appending the results of injuries to the head occurring at the siege of Se- bastopo].] [Tables showin'^ the number and results of the cases of Gunshot Injury to the Head treated from ° the 1st of April 1855 to the close of the Crimean War.] Non-commissioned Officers and Frivalos.

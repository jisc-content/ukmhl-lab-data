The disease may have several issues. It may prove mortal bv the extent of the blood poisoni.fg^ oi- by thre^- hanstiou consequent on gangrene, or may wear he patient out by slow suppuration, as is often the case after phlegmonous erysipelas. This form of erysipelatous inflammation, not al- ways having the outward redness to distinguish it, has been mistaken for acute rheumatism ; froin which It may be diagnosed by the depressed nature 01 the pulse and constitutional symptoms, and bv the existence, which will usually be discovered in the traumatic cases, of a local injury. One of the cases above recorded had its origin in a dissection wound Other cases of the same kind will be related m the article Wounds ] T,/AT°'"-~A'y''P^^^"'''' ^'^^^^^ thatcannever be lightly regarded, and is often most dangerous As inotherdisea8es,thepatienfs chance of life will be in direct proportion to his strength, and inversely to the extent of mischief. The extremes of infancy and atre drunken and dissipated habits, and the existence of previous disease, especially of the kidneys or iver, tell very much against the patient. It will be bad for him too, if erysipelas be epidemic and severe, and if he have contracted the disease by contagion or infection from some patient who has it severely. A very extensive attack, and large sup- purations, are also dangerous, particularly about the head, or the throat, or scrotum, or anus, or lower extreniities. But, after all, it is the pulse, the state of breathing, the state of the mind, and the power ot taking nourishment and of procuring sleep, which will guide the surgeon's prognosis. There are three sources or periods of danger : First, from extensive tebrile excitement, or constitutional irritation from poisoned blood in the early stage. Secondly, from the exhaustion of pain and confinement of matter. Thirdly, from general pyasmia and visceral in- flammation, or from purulent absorption, diarrhoea and hectic, or from the profuse discharge. If local' swelling seem to subside, but the pulse continues quick, or quicker, and the tongue does not improve. It IS ominous, for then a portion of areolar tissue may be sloughing, or some internal part may be attacked. The remote consequences, even if life be pre- served, are often very disastrous. A limb maybe withered, shrunk, and useless ; or there may bo a general cachexia, and tendency to diarrhcea, dys- pepsia and phthisis, or what is very frequent after ut d whb "'•^'^'P''.''''^' tJ-^ patient may be perse- wit h r'^''\^"'=<=«^=."'" of boils or carbuncles, or arSsJLtttr'^'" ^""^ which are so common il/etesto«.._This word really means, that a means that several parts ir^^X:::^ t^ a common phenomenonin all blood d r^- nettle-rash gout, and rheumatism, and in pyemia and the who e erysipelatous alliance.

The redness is seen on a trans- verse section to be confined to the outermost thin layer of the cutis ; the deeper layer is pale, and IS somewhat infiltrated only when the inflamma- tion is intense ; the subcutaneous cellular tissue IS tbeii in like manner slightly infiltrated." (Pa- thologiml Anatomy, vol. iii. Syd. Sac. Ed.) In the phlegmonous variety, and in the diffuse inflarmnation, the cuticle is wrinkled and vesicated the skin gangrenous in patches ; after death the' areolar tissue will be found infiltrated with liquid, which, according to the severity and dura- tion of the disease, will be pale or yellow serous, reddish and turbid, milky and semi-purulent, or a greenish pus ; and the tissue itself reddish md vascular, or thickened and solidified by fibrinous effusion, or dead and rotten, like flakes of tow, or wetted chamois leather," to which Mr. .Tamos compares it. The subjacent fascia may be de- stroyed, and intermuscular spaces infiltrated ; or even portions of muscle may be invaded, and ren- dered pale, softened, or gangrenous ; the veins and lymphatics, which pass bj', reddened or suppurat- ing, ruritlcnt depots, as they are called, may be found in the joints, or in the areolar tissue of vari- ous parts of the bod}', or in the viscera ; in fact, the whole series of morbid appearances may be present which are common to the whole er3'sipe- latons group of diseases, including puerperal fever, pyasmia, &c. &c.

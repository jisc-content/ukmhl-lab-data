29 Bathing frequently is also a valuable adjuvant. The bath should be tepid so as neither to exhaust or depress the vital powers. In conclusion, we have only to repeat what we have already said, that scurvy is a pre-eminently preventable disease. A case of scurvy in a camp or garrison is a reproach to some one. Let the members of our profession who are charged with the medical care of our sick soldiers see to it that the reproach does not rest \vith them. WILLIAM A. HAMMOND, Chairman. â–  JOSEPH CARSON, M.

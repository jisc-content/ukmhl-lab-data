27 confident, entirely prevent it. Dissolved as far as possible in water, with a little sugar added, it makes a very pleasant drink. The efficacy of potash is inferentially ver}' strongly sup- ported by the fact that those vegetables which are most prized as anti-scorbutics contain it in larger quantity. Thus' besides the lime-juice, in wliich it exists as an acid salt, we find ilmtjjotatoes, which are almost as efiicacious, contain it in large quantities. In New Mexico, when the winter had passed, we found the best results were obtained from the use as a salad or greens of the lambs' quarter, (chenoiMdium cdhum,) one of the first of the spring plants. The men devoured it with the greatest avidity. Upon anah'sis of the expressed juice we found it to abound in potash. The sorrel, (rumex acetoseUa,) which has likewise proved of the greatest value as an anti-scorbutic, owes its power to the acid salt, the binoxalate of potassa, which it con- tains. Both these plants are found throughout the United States. Pickles and saiter kraut are also valuable anti-scorbutics, though not to be compared with those named. The French in the Crimea found great benefit from the use of the dandelion, (leontodon taraxacum,) which was largely gathered by the men, and which they ate with vinegar. We might mention many other special anti-scorbutics, but we think enough has been said to direct attention to those which are most valuable. Almost any succulent vege- table will give such a variety to the ordinary diet of the soldier as to prevent the occurrence of scurvy. If our army should always get the full ration, (which is scarcely to be

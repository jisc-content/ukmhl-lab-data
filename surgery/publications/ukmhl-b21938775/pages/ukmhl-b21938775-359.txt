9 With reference to the etiologj', there are several points of interest. 1st. The disease is very little apt to commence at night. 2tl. From the middle of summer to the heginning of winter, is the season, dni'ing which it is most prevalent in the United States. 3d. It is not possible to predict the amount of malarious fever that will ensue, from any given conditions of heat, mois- ture, atmospheric or telluric ])henomena. 4th. In the more temperate regions, the intermittent type predominates. As we approach the erpiator, there is more ten- dency in the fever to become remittent or contjestive. 5th. From Forry's tables, we infer that the relative preva- lence of the disease, in different sections of the United States, is as follow^s, viz.: On the northern lakes, 193. Posts north oV39'^ north latitude, at a distance from the sea and great lakes, 151. Sea coast stations from Delaware capes to Savannah, 370. In the sonth-west, including Jefferson barracks, Forts Gibson, Smith, Coffee, Towson, and Jesup, 747. On tlie Lower Mississippi, 385. In East Florida, 520. 6th. It is an incontestable fact that negroes are more exempt than whites from all miasmatic ailments. It is believed that in mulattoes, the liability to suffer is regulated by the amount of Caucasian blood, in the individual concerned. 7th. The poison of fever may remain in the system very vari- ous times after exposure to malaria. In some instances, a few days only will elapse, before the disease declares itself; in others, an interval of four oi- hve months—perhaps longer—may pass over, before the manifestation of symptoms. 8th. There is a certain protective power against the influence in question, by wdiat is known as seasonmg or acclimation: in other words, l)y previous residence in the infected locality.

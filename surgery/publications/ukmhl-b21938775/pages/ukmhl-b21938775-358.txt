8 pulse increases in frequency and force, wliilst the q\iickened respiration is normal in rhythm. The headache becomes more severe, as do the other neuralgic pains; the tongue is furred— anorexia continues ; so may nausea and vomiting with constipa- tion of the bowels. The thermometer shows an increased heat of the body, above the normal standard. The secretions are diminished, including that of the urine, wdiicli is high colored, and fre- quently yields dejDosits of urates, on cooling. In many indivi- duals, delirium is a striking synBptom. In others, a strong dis- position to sopor or coma is observed. After a variable duration, the febrile symptoms described diminish in intensity, and, finally, disappear—sometimes sud- denly, at others, gradually, the body becoming cooler, and covered with a more or less copious perspiration. It is through this third or sweating stage, that the intermission is reached. During this, the patient may complain severely of malaise and debility, or he may be altogether unconscious of any ail- ment. Many variations from the description above given may be met with. There may be no perceptible chill, the paroxysm seeming to commence with the hot stage. There may be no fever, and no sweating, the chilly sensations only being those recognised; or, lastly, there may be a periodical sweat, with- out chill or fever. Indeed, any Avell marked periodical patho- logical phenomena, not known as hectic, occurring in malari- ous regions, are by some practically regarded as belonging to the disease under description ; since the same agency gives rise to them, and to the same remedy must we look for cure. The ]:)eriod elapsing between the termination of a paroxysm, and the commencement of that which succeeds, is called the intermission. The diagnosis of this disease, consideration being given to the place and circumstances in which it occurs, is not generally attended with difliculty, after observation of one paroxysm.

23 to, tlic (liscapoboa-iiis to decline on (lie nearer approacli of cold wcntlicr, and generally ceases to prevail liy the month of November. Tlic rreqiient occurrence of dyscntci-y in tlie aniumn, and in localities whci'c periodical fevers prevail, as well as the occa- sional union or alternation of the two affections in the same per- son, has lent some color to the opinion that both forms of dis- ease arc due to the same poison or malaria. But if malaria is regarded as a simple agent, the doctrine is iiotonly improbable, but incredible. On the other hand, considering marsh miasm as a compound in which a specific poison fitted for generating pei'iodical fevers is associated with (he peculiar ])roducts of vegetable decomposition, their joint agency in the prodnctiou of the two diseases liecomes readily explicable. It is very cer- tain that epidemic dysentei-y often exists where the fevers in question are uidcuown, ])ut where the atmosphere is loaded with tlie exhalations of decomposing animal and vegetable sid)- stauces; and on the other hand, that these fevers prevail quite iiide|)endently of dysentery in malarious regions. Such facts are quite inconsistent with the hypothesis of a single morliid poison being the ellicieut cause of iiot h diseases. It is fiirlJiei-to be considered that, miasmatic fevers induce a state of debility and impoverishment of the blood which must ncccssai'ily promote and intensify the operation of all the direct- exciting causes of dysentery, and particularly of crude and unwholesome food and foul ail'; and conseipienlly that, such conditions favoring, dys- entery will be apt to prevail along with periodical fevers in camps and barracks, and similar aggregations of men, when suflicient attention is not paid to t,li(! cleanliness and ventilation of the t,<'nts, cliaml)ers, ttc. But, independenl|v of any such predisposing cause as niarsh miasm, the condition of large bodies of nuMi nmy be im|)aircd by otJier agencies, so as to render dyscjitcry C])idemic among

25 firmly liealed, are capable of sustaining any desiiable degree of direct use. It must not be overlooked, liowever, that sinuses occasionally form, leading to carious bone, which long remain a serious drawback to the usefulness of the stump. ~We are authorized in concluding:— That the stvmj) after Syme'^s or Pirogofs ojKration is the most serviceable, without artificial aid I jyreference hciny given to the former. The question of adapting artificial limbs to these several stumps mainly rests with those engaged in mechanical sur- gery. So far as we have been able to ascertain the fticts, Syme's operation gives much the best stump for an artificial extremity. Although a foot can be supplied cheaply in Chopart's amputation, yet it but poorly remedies the defect, and does not improve the patient's power of walking. An artificial limb may be applied to Syme's stump, Avhich both relieves deformity, and renders the patient's gait free from the slightest halt. The following opinion of an intelligent mecha- nical surgeon, of great experience, is worthy of nolice:— 'Among the numeroiis instances of mutilated feet through the tarsus, which fall to our care for treatment, it is seldom that we are able to designate a perfectly satisfactory stump, one to be preferred to what might have been made of parts conti- guous. Nine-tenths of the mutilations, as by Chopart, present one or more of the following diagnostics, to wit: First, of an insufficient covering; caries, more or less, of the remaining tarsal bones; ulceration of the surrounding soft jiarts, or that of ft thin shining pellicle of covering, exceedingly susceptible, quickly inflamed, and abi'aded by the least exposure, which renders it hazardous or diflicult to attempt the application of any substitute. Second, a total inability to flex the stump, and to preserve its normal position at a right angle with the line of the leg; a morbid contraction of the gastrocnemii muscles (without antagonism), and retraction of the heel; a pendent position of the end of the stump, and exposure of the cicatrix

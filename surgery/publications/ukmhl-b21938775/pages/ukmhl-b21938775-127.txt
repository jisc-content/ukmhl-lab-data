AMPUTATIONS. TiiK following general rules in regard to Amputations, for the guidance of Army Surgeons in the field, are advocated hy the best modern authorities on the subject. NECESSITY OF AMPUTATION. 1. Cases where a limb is nearly or completely carried away, leaving a ragged stump, with laceration of the soft parts, and projection of the bone. 2. Cases in which the soft parts of a liml) arc extensively lacerated or contused, the principal arterial and nervous trunks destroyed, and the bone denuded or fractured. 3. Cases in which a similar condition exists, without either fracture or denudation of the bone. 4. Cases of compound and comminuted fracture, particularly those involving joints. 6. Gun-shot wounds in which the ball docs not actually pene- trate the joint, but in which the bone being struck above or below, tile fracture extends into the joint. C. Guu-shot wounds between the phalanges of the fingers or toes, do not necessitate amputation. 7. Gun-shot wounds penetrating the wrist, unless great lacer- ation has occurred, do not necessarily demand amputation. 8. In guii-i~liot injuries of tlic shoulder and elbow joints, pro- vided the main blood-vessels and nerves are not injured, ex- cision may be practised witli a fair pros})ect of success.

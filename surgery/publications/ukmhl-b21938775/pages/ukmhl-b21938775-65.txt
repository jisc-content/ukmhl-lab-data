11 a good stump may ultimately be made, the knee-joint and life being preserved, which latter is frequently lost after amputation under such circiunstances. 30. Hospital gangrene, when it unfortunately occurs, should be considered to be contagions and infectious, and is to be treated locally by destructive remedies, such as nitric acid, and the bivouacking or encamping of the remainder of the wounded, if it can be eifected, or their removal to the open air. 31. Poultices have been very often applied in gun-shot wounds, from laziness, or to cover neglect, and should be used as seldom as possible. 32. Chlorofonn [or ether] may be administered in all cases of amputation of the upper extremity and below the knee, and in all minor oj)erations ; which cases may also be deferred, with- out disadvantage, until the more serious operations are per- formed. 33. Amputation of the upper and middle parts of the thigh are to be done as soon as possible after the receipt of the injury. The administration of chloroform [or ether] in them, when there is much prostration, is doubtful, and must be attended to, and observed with great care; the question whether it should or should not be administered in such cases being undecided. 34. If tlie young surgeon should not feel quite equal to the ready performance of the various operations recommended, many of them requiring great anatomical knowledge and manual dex- terity, (and it is not to be expected that he should,) he sliould avail himself of every opportunity which may offer of perfecting his knowledge. [It is to be hoped that the medical officers of the army will aim to equal the surgery of the civil hospitals of the country, and that they will not only correct any errors into which their predecessors may have fallen, but excel them by the additions their opportunities will permit them to make, in the improve- ment of the great art and science of surgery,]

probable that fifteen iniles is as great a distance as lias been known to exist between navigable ^vater and the locality of an epidemic. Woodville, in Mississippi, is more remote from the river than any other place known to have been thus visited. It frequently originates and prevails extensively on ship- board, when the affected vessels have lately been in the neigh- borhood of places suffering from the fever. In some very rare instances it has occurred in vessels " without the operation of external agencies or the introduction of contagious germs." (La Roche.) In 1799 the frigate General Greene left Newport for Havana. Before reaching port, yellow fever appeared on board, although Havana, ait that time, was free from the dis- ease. When occurring thus, in a majority of cases, " it be- gins in the vicinity of the pumps and the main hatchways, where the shell of the ship is most dependent, where, con- sequently, there is the greatest amount of moisture and of heat." In Newcastle, Jamaica, 4,000 feet above the sea, Lawson re- cords an epidemic. Wherever it may occur, there is often a remarkable tendency to limitation as regards the space over which it extends. A berth in a ship—one side of a vessel—a block of a city—one side of a street, may, for a long time, funiish all the cases in an epidemic. Season.—In the United States, we most commonl}- meet with the early cases during the months of July or August. Tlie disease is prone to last until the first hard frost. During twenty-one successive years, in ISTew^ Orleans, the extreme limits between the arrival and departure of yellow fever were the 23d May and the last day of December. Jleat and Moisture.—A certain degree of heat seems neces- sary for the development of the disease, and it is common to

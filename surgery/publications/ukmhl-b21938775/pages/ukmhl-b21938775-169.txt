Washington, Dec. 6, 1862 Secretary. The attention of The United States Sanitary Commission has been directed to the fact, that most of our Army Surgeons, now in the field, are unavoid- ably deprived of many facilities tliey have heretofore enjoyed for the con- sultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place within their reach any thing that can be termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution among the medical staff, of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying, in a condensed form, the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions which are likely to present themselves to surgeons in the field, on the largest scale, and which are, therefore, of chief practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of pre[)aring papers on several subjects of this nature, to certain of its associate members, in our principal cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names are the best evi- dence of their fitness for their duty. The following paper on " Venereal Diseases" belongs to this series, and is respectfully recommended by the Commission to the medical officers of our army now in the field. FiJED. Law Oi-msted,

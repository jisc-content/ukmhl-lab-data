VACCINATIOX IN ARMIES. 35 faintest possible exudation of blood, and tluit only after the lapse of a second or two; but, if a greater flow of blood docH ensue, the operation will be no less certain in its results, al- though a little neatness will have been needlessly sacrificed. To that gn~)ui> of scratches from which the Ijlood first exudes, the charged point of a quill is to be applied ; the lymph thereon will be immediately absorbed ; the particle of blood with the lymph in solution, is to l)e then taken up on the point of the quill, applied to, smeared over, and pressed into the other scratches, in succession, two or three times. "â€¢ When the dissolved scab or fluid lymph is employed, it is to be applied on the point of the lancet, precisely as the dis- solved lymph on the point of tlie quill." Yaccine lymph on a quill-point is best introduced by insert- ing it about a quarter of an inch into a flat, superflcial valvular incision under the cuticle, made by a narrow-bladed lancet in the skin over the attachment of the left deltoid muscle, keep- ing the quill-point there for a minute or two, wiping it off on the edges of the cut as it is withdrawn, and avoiding, in the whole operation, the eflfusion of blood, as far as possible.

11 At the period of my last visit to Europe, some ten years since, t*rofessor Simpson bad then given cliloroforni to over 8,000 persons without a single fatal result from its use, and by this time be has, no doubt, more than duplicated that experience. In the Crimean war, it was used commonly and freely. Baudens speaks of several thousand cases in which it bad been used without accident, and McLeod reports over 20,000 eases, with only a single fatality. Even when ignorantly and carelessly employed, there is less dan- ger than is commonly apprehended. Wlj^en last in Paris, I saw it used continually, and freely, and carelessly, \vith little precaution to dilute the vapor, and by rude means—a sort of bag tied over the mouth and^nose of tlie patient,— yet beard of no case of asphyxia from its use. Both chloro- form and ii'ther are contiiuniUy emploj'ed in this city, in the hospitals and public institutions, Us well as in private prac- tice, with* little or no regard to either the quantity or intensity of tlie vapor, and yet but very few accidents have occurred. In my own practice, I have never seen a death from their use. But there is another reason for employing anfestbetics which must not be forgotten. The insermbiUtij of the patient is a great convenience to the suir/eoii. How often, when operating in some deep, dark wound, along the course of some great vein, with thin v.-alls, alter- nately distended and flaccid with tlie vital current—bow often have I dreaded that some unfortunate struggle of the patient would deviate the knife a little from its proper course, and that I, who l^iin would be the deliverer, sliould involuntarily become the executioner, seeing my patient pen.sb in my hands by the most appalling form of death 1 Had he been insensible, I should have felt no alarm.

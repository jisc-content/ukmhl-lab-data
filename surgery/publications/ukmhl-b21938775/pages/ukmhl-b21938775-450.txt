24 pital gangrene in tlie western hospitals. In Lis special Surgeon Brin- rcport to the Siirgeon-General, Dr. Brinton says : " The ton's report upon . . hospital gan- development of this disease on the route seems to have grene. ■'• been owing to the fact that the transportation of the wounded was efiectted by means of crowded and ill-ven- tilated boats, and that the trip by the Cumberland and Ohio rivers frequently occupied several days. During this time these patients, who had . already undergone much suf- fering, were exposed to all the influences most apt to engender this disease. In contrast with this fact, it was found that, as soon as the Louisville and Nashville Rail- road was opened, so that the wounded could be conveyed from city to city in one day, all importation of gangrenou.3 sores into Louisville ceased. The development of hospital gangrene during the boat transportation is a noticeable fact, and is strikingly analogous with the same phenomena observed among our paroled wounded prisoners from Rich- mond, received into the Annapolis General Hospital some months since." o/"ar7fnofe"an^ ^^^'^ trausport sliips for troops upon the sea coast and mtnloiTii^t ^"Ifj ^l^e evils of crowdiug, lack of ventilation, and the P""""" presence of infectious diseases, have already produced serious results in a number of instances; and, as the war progresses, there will be constantly increasing necessity for much greater care in the sanitary management of such transports.

IG iferous tubes. Doctor Lawson observed that the chlorides com- mence to diminish with the appearance of albumen and are nearly entirely absent when active tubular desquamation is at its height. They began to reappear about tlie seventh day, in favorable cases, and increased in abundance from day to day. It is proper to observe, that in repeated instances, Dr. Porcher found the urine free from albumen. Its presence was excep- tional. The urine is not usually abundant until the establishment of convalescence. " When the secretion was copious and trans- parent, even thougb dark colored and most highly coagulable, the struggle was hopefully maintained," (Blair.) Acid, during the first stage, it habitually preserves this re- action, until convalescence or admixture with bile, when it becomes alkaline. Its color is normal, until the third day, when a sulphur, straw, or primrose tint is observed. This deepens, until it assumes a yellow or orange hueâ€”sometimes, in large quantity, seeming even black. Globuline and casein, creatine and creatinine have been noted by Dr. Lawson in his Jamaica experience. Urea is deficient, as Porcher's excellent observations have shown. Suip'pression is commonly abrupt, Not even black vomit is a more fatal symptom. IIa3maturia is not often met with, and is not highly unftivorable, yer se. The occurring of neuralgic pains is mentioned as being among the early symptoms. Tliese, as a rule, last through the fever, and are, in many instances, inexpressibly agonizing, causing the stoutest and bravest men to complain and groan. Another neurotic trouble, scarcely more supportable, is the un- speakable malaise, under which many labor. Even whilst de- nying the existence of any discomfort, the patient will be incessantly occupied in changing his position in bed, in rising to go to the window or to walk the floor.

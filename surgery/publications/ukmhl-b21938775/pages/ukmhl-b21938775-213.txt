W.vsiiiNGToN, Dec. 6, 18G1. Secrcturij. The attoiitioa of t1io Sanitary Coininission has liooii dirocU'd {n the fact, that most of our Army Surgeons, now in tlie licld, are unavoidalily deprix ed of many faeilities tliey liavc heretofore enjoyed for tlie cnnsultalinn of standard medical autiiorities. It is obviously im[)ossilile to jdaee within their roacli any thing tlnit ran bo termed a inedieal library. 'J'he only remedy seems to be the [(reparation and distribution among the nu'dical staff, of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying, in a condensed form, the conclusions of the liigliest medical authorities in regard to those medical and sui'gieal (questions which are likely to pi'csent themselves to surgeons in the held, on the largest scale, ;ind \vhich are, therefore, of chief practical importance. The C'limmission has assigned the duty of j)re[iaring papers on several subjects of this nature, to cei'tain of its associate mendicrs, in our iirincip.-d cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names are the best evi- dence of their fitness for their duty. ■fiie following paper on ■' Continued Fevers" belongs to this scries, and is i-cspectfiilly recommended by the Commission to the medical officers of our army now in tlie field.

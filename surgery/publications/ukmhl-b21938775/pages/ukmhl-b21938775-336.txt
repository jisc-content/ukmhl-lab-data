The attention of the Sanitary Commission has been directed to the fact that most of our Army Surgeons, now in the field, are unavoidably de- prived of many facilities they have heretofore enjoyed for the consultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place within their reach anything that can be termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution among the medical stafi", of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying in a condensed form the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions which are likely to present themselves to surgeons in the field, on the largest scale, and which are, therefore, of chief practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing papers on several subjects of this nature, to certain of its associate members, in our princi- pal cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names are the best evidence of their fitness for their duty. The following paper on "The Treatment of Fractures in Military Surgery" belongs to this series, and is respectfully recommended by the Commission to the medical officers of our army now in the field. .

8 ON nEMORRHAGE FROM WOUNDS. binding his sash so tightly about the stump as to arrest the ilow. Bj reference to the first diagram it will be seen, that the great artery which supplies the arm with blood, passes out from the chest under the collar bone, and over the first rib. At the crossing of the artery over the first rib, Surgeons, when about to amputate at the shoulder joint, arrest the circulation, by pressing down upon the artery from above and behind the collar bone, at about its centre, with some smooth flat substance which will readily indent the flesh, such as the ring of a door-key. But it is hardly to be supposed that unprofessional persons without experience should succeed at this obscure point; and, as bleed- ing from wounds in the armpit is the only accident to which this treatment is ever applied, I will rather presume the process to be impracticable to the uninitiated, and direct the wound itself to be immediately filled with some substance, such as a portion of the shirt or other clothing, and constriction applied directly to the source of the flowl The highest point of the arm then to which we will consider the Tourniquet applicable, is the axilla or armpit, and here it is to be applied with the pad directly over the wound, with or with- out other filling, and tightened over the top of the shoulder until the hemorrhage is arrested. By referring to the diagram again, we shall see that the artery, after leaving the arm-pit, passes down along the inner side of the arm, winding forward, until at the bend of the elbow we find it occupying the centre of the front of the arm, directly under the veins where the operation of blood-letting is usually performed, which is the lowest limit of the region for the application of the Tourniquet in the superior extremity. Here the pulsation of the artery may be readily felt in the human body by pressing upan it with the points of the fingers. If we divest the superior extremity of clothing, and lay a piece * of twine with one end over the middle of the collar bone, and the other over the centre of the space in front of the elbow, this line will mark out the position of the brachial artery; and in thin persons pulsation may be felt along its whole course. The pad of the Tourniquet may be applied to any portion of this line and

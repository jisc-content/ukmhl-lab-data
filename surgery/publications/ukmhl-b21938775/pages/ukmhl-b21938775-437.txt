In this instance, tlie case of scarlatina was removed a short distance from the lines of the encampment the hour that the evidences of his disease appeared, and a rigid domestic quarantine of the sick man and his clothing was estal)lislied. Ilis nurse was the only other victim of the infection. After a detention of a few weeks, when these four regiments were sent forward to the field, tl le one last mentioned had its lull quota ot men; in uiKse four reg- while the three others had only about tAvo-thirds the number of soldiers who, a few weeks previously, had gone into their encampment in full health—except the single company in which the measles first appeared. "\Ye might add otlier illustrative instances of the pernicious effects of the exanthematons contagions in camps, but they would all tend mei'ely to strengthen this cumulative testi- mony to the hygienic utility and military necessity of special p,.eventive san- restrictive measures for arresting and preventing the spread agafnst'exan'ihe- of this class of diseases. And what is true of exanthematons njc5™ary''Tn''fhe contagions, is practically, though in a modified sense, true of other diseases that depend upon specific and infections poisons. The special sanitary measures, which such poisons require for their control, may all be comprised under the sinqde rule that— T/w immediate sources of infectwts 2yoiso7is shoidd l>e A general rule 7 •7j7_/^ •/'/7 /77 7-' tobc observerl in ]}roperly isolated from umnfeded j^'^'^'som, the locahzing re\:v\m\o Mm- conditions of their endemic])revdlence shoidd he removed^ and every circiimstance that adds to their virulence or tends to give them existence or activity, shoidd le iwevented or con trolled Ijy sanitary measures.

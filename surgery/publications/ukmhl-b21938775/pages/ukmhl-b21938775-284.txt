26 cari-iod llie disease to tlieir families ; and, finally, tliat tlie at- tendants npon dyscnleric patients, even when they did nol con- tract the disease, exhibited its malignant influence in numerous sul)(!Utaneous abscesses and an erniition of scro purulent Ijlebs (rupia.) These are sufficient reasons why, in the public service at least, the most scrupulous precautions should be taken, on the one hand, to prevent the concentration.of dysenteric patients in close apartments, and, on the other, to restrict, as much as possible, tlieir communication with other patients, or with persons who are still in health. It is very doubtful whether dysentery attacks the same person, twice. 'J'hat it does so occasionally is probable ; that it does do so frequently is certain. But there is still a question whether it is to be raidced in this respect with typhoid fever or with typhus, both of wliich arc contagious, but the former pro- tects from subsequent attacks as pci'fectly as small-pox, while the hitter nuay occur in the same person an indefinite number of times. Treatment.â€”Any attempt to describe the treatment of dys- entery shows the propriety of studying the several forms of the disease, as has been done in this paper. Each ol' them requires a procedure which would be improper or insufficient in any other form. So extremely diU'erent arc these methods, that, while in sinqile dysentery the essential remedies are almost wholly ncgalJve, and the cure may be iuti'usted lo nature alone, the ciroid.s of nature arc too oficn unavailing in the typhoid variety of the disease, and the vigorous intei-vcntion of art becomes inq)era,tivcly necessary to coml)at. the siqxM'added or ad\(Mililious state of the system. The bilious phenomena which predominate! in another variety woidd be aggravated by llie ajipropriate remedies of the typhoid form, and in cm I licr (d'these the antij)hlogistic method wouM be inappropi-ialc, although it

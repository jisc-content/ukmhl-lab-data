The attention of the Sanitary Commission has been called to the fact that most of our Army Surgeons now in the field are unavoidably deprived of many facilities they have here- tofore enjoyed for the consultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place within their reach anything that can be termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution, among the medical officers of the army, of a series of brief essays, or hand-books, embodj'ing, in a condensed form, the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions which are likely to present themselves to surgeons in the field, on the largest scale, and which are, therefore, of chief practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing paperc on several subjects of this nature to certain of its assoc-iate members, in our principal cities, belonging to the medical profession. The following paper on Dysentery belongs to this series, and is respectfully recommended by the Commission to the attention of medical officers. FRED. LAW OLMSTED, Secretary. Washington, Feb., 186Z.

EEPOllT OlSr DYSENTEllY. The experience of recent as well as remoter times shows thai the two great oa-uscs of death in armies are typhus, with itK •allied forms of fever, and dysentkuy. It also proves that, when they are most fatal, all of these diseases arise from the neglect of well-established sanitary rules, and that their ravage?; •are least destructive whenever an intelligent appreciation of their forms, grades, and complications governs their treatments This is emphatically true of dysentery. " Can.ip dysentery" is far from being uniformly the same. It may vary in type a5 greatly as dysentery does in civil life, presenting all siiades of ■difference from a slight and transient bowel complaint, with scarcely any general symptoms, to a violent inflammatory affection, or a malignant and putrid fever. It is the object of this Report to remind the army surgeon of these fundamental diversities of type, and of the very different methods of treat- ment which they render necessary. Appropriately to fulfil it, all that is essentia*! in regard to the description, causation, treat- ment, and prevention of dysentery must be reviewed as fully as the practical purpose of the paper will permit. In doing.so we shall confine ourselves to those pathological facts which have a direct relation to the treatment and prevention of the disease, leaving entirely aside the more or less speculative dis- cussions which the inquiry may suggest* Morbid Anatomy.—On opening the abdomen after death by dysentery, the relative positions of the intestinal folds is

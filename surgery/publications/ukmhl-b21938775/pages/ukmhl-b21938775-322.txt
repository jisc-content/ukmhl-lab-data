The disease also showed itself in other corps to such a degree, that it' was found necessary to send to a great distance, and at considerable expense, for supplies of potatoes. The principal medical officer, pending their arrival in sufficient abundance, recom- mending them to be used as a salad, dressed \^■ith vinegar, in order to procure their full curative effects.

In this instance the direct causes of dysentery were present—dense fogs, periodic rains, cold winds, and elevated locality; and scurvy appeared in association with dysentery; and it was

13 It is heller to employ no special apparatus for inhalation. All that is needed is a common lineu liuudkerchief, on which the licjuid is poured. This should be held loosely ia the hands of the operator, as in the folded condition it might interfere too much with respiration. If xthev is used, little attention is paid to quantity—from two to four ounces being commonly required for an adult; and all the caution neces- sary is not to exhibit it so rapidly as to excite a cotTgh. If chloroform is employed, less quantity will be required—from one to four drachms being generally sufficient. But care must be taken to dilute the vapor sufficiently with atmos- pheric air. Darbiij the inhalation the ixdicnt should always be in a rcciuubeid position. We must remember that the vapor of chloroform is exceedingly heavy, having a speciiic gi-avity more than four times that of common air, with little dis- position to diffuse itself. Carbonic acid, whicli weighs only one and a half times more than common air, nmy l)e poured from one vessel into another like water. By i-ea.ion, then, of its great gravity, the vapor of chloroform pas.scs into the kings more j'cadily when inhaled in the recumhem posiure; audit for any reason we should desire to free the lungs speedily, fi'om its presence, we can do so with most facility •when the i)atient is in the same position. Tlic circiiliition of the blood through the lungs is now known to depend on the reaction of its carbonizud constitu- ents with the oxygen of the air; and in those cases where death has occurred during inhalation, this result is to be attributed rather to the absence of oxygen in the lungs than to the presence of chloroform in the blood. We niay presume that anresthctic vapors are not poisonous of thciuselvcs, ljut when ignorautly or carelessly used they

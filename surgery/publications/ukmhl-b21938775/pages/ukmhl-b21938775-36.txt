10 MILITARY HYGIENE AND THERAPKUTTCS trusted to his care. Your committee proposes to consider the subject of military lijgicue in some of its most important de- tails. I. The Selection of a Ground for an Encamipvient. It is a matter of the utmost importance, whenever it is practi- cable, to avoid encamping in a malarious district. The encamp- ing ground should be dry, moderately elevated, and with a sufficient slope to prevent water from stagnating when it rains. It should be in the vicinity of pure water drinking and wash- ing, and there should be an abundant supply of fuel for cook- ing. The want of water in the vicinity of an encampment is a very formidable evil. When the French army, after the battle of Alma, encamped near the village of Mackenzie, they found but two or three wells, which were soon exhausted. The soldiers called the camp " the camp of thirst." They en- dured great suffering in consequence of the want of water. In selecting a site for encampment on the banks of a river, care should be taken to guard against the danger of inunda- tion by a rapid rise of the water, from melting of snow, or from a sudden fall of rain. If military necessity should require an encampment in the neighborhood of an extensive marsh, the ground should always, if possible, be selected on the wind- ward side, so that the prevailing winds should carry away the noxious emanations from the soil. When soldiers are exposed to cold and damp air without suitable protection, the injurious effects of such exposure will be diminished by the judicious use of camp-fires. In malarious districts, the protective use of the sulphate of quinine is to be highly commended. Each man may take three to ten grains daily, according to the in- tensity of the malarious influence. It may' be taken in one dose at bedtime.

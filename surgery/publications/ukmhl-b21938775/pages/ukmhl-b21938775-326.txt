24 scurvy occurs, some one is to blame: fur its causes are altogether under our control. As the causes of scurvy are physical, moral, and dietetic, our measures of prevention come under the same heads. Physical means of prevention.â€”First among them is the adoption of measures to secure a due allowance of pure air. This can readily be done in barracks by giving to each soldier at least six hundred cubic feet of space, and opening the window (where other means of ventilation are not provided) so as to allow of the free admission of the external air and the exit of that which has become impure. Soldiers, like civilians, have too great a hori'or of a draft of air, and positive orders and constant watching will be necessary to make them attend to this point. In camp, the tents should not be placed too close together; should not be overcrowded, and should be struck every clear day, and the bedding, &c., thoroughly aired. At least once a week the tents should be moved a few feet so as to cover fresh ground. In addition, a thorough state of police should be kept up.

14 REMARKS. In deciding upon the point of amputation, surgeons are very properly governed by the following simple rules :— 1st. Tbe comparative danger of the operation ; and 2nd, The comparative usefulness of the stnmp. If there were two given points at which an amputation might be performed, no prudent surgeon would select the one having the largest mortality, unless the ultimate advantages were of the utmost importance to the usefulness or happiness of the patient. Of the operations on the foot which we have passed in review, it may be said that in all which involve the parts anterior to the medio-tarsal, or Chopart's amputation, these two conditions combine to determine the sm-geou to save as much of the extremity as possible. The mortality of the operation diminishes and the usefulness of the limb increases in proportion to the amount preserved. There can be no doubt, therefore, that it is the duty of the operator to preserve as much of the anterior portion of the foot as possible. But new and important questions arise when we attempt to decide upon the value of the three remaining operations by the rules proposed. With a view to a proper appreciation of the alleged advantages and disadvantages of these amputa- tions, in order to arrive at correct conclusions as to their com- parative merits, we present the following summary of opinions by surgical authorities. Chopart's 6>/>era^!^■o?^.—Chopart's operation has now been practised nearly three-quarters of a century, and has been, during the whole period, the subject of severe criticism. On the one hand it is contended that the stump is entirely ser- viceable, that the ojieration is attended with slight mortality, and that by it an important portion of the foot is preserved. On the other, it is asserted that the stump is generally tender, very often affected with incurable ulcers, and, finally," that the extremity of the stnmp is liable to become the most depending

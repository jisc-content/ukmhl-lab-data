A SUMMARY OF THE SYMPTOMS, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT OF CONTINUED FEVERS. Fevers are divided into Essential, or Idiopathic, and Sjnip- toinatie : tlie latter depending solely on some local affection, are not considered here. The former are snbdivided into Remit- tents, Intermittents, and Continned Fevers, to which may be added, as coming strictly into neither of the above families, Yellow Fever. From the widely extended field of its operations, most of the above-named diseases are prevalent in our army, and all, in their every variety and form, may sooner or later be looked for. It will come within the scope of this paper to deal witli Con- tinued Fevers only. Of these there are three,* viz :â€” Ierttativf, Fever (so called), TvPHOiD Fkvee, and Typhus Fevek. Wo propose to give, as concisely as possible, the ordinary diagnostic characteristics of these diseases, with some of their symptoms and causes, together with a brief summary of treat- ment. * The Relapsing Fever of Great Britain is omitted in these descriptions, being rarely if ever seen in this country.

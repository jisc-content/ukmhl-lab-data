27 was not dressed for several liours. The limb was placed in an elevated j^osition, and cold water freely applied. The advantages of this delay were evident; the deep cavity formed by the extremity of the heel in the posterior flap contracted to a small size, which, with the complete cessation of the oozing of blood, removed the danger following its collection and dis- organization in this situation. In every instance when the wound was dressed, the posterior flap was found as warm as the leg, and quite as sensitive to the prick of the needle, showing that its vascular and nervous supply was undiminished. The only other fact worthy of notice in the after treatment, was the daily injection of tepid water and disinfecting fluids into the cavity of the stump while suppuration continued. By these means the internal surface of the wound was cleansed, and the process of granulation and adhesion promoted. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS. I. In all amputations of the Lower Extremity, the Surgeon should be GOVERNED IN TDE SELECTION OF THE POINT OF OPERATION AND THE METHOD TO BE ADOPTEDâ€” 1. By THE Mortality of the operations in question; 2. By the adaptability of the Stump to the most serviceable artificial LIMBS. II. In all injuries of the Foot, involving parts anterior to the Medio- tarsal articulation, the Surgeon should sacrifice as little as possible of THE structures essential to progression. He should preserve 1. Single Phalanges, the importance of which increases from the small to the great toe : 2. The Metatarsus, by amputation of the Phalanges, or by the Exci- sion OF individual Metacarpal bones ; 3. The Tarsus, by amputation at the Tarso-Metatarsal articulation (Hey's or Lisfranc's method). III. Of the amputations through the Tarsus or at the Ankle-Joint,

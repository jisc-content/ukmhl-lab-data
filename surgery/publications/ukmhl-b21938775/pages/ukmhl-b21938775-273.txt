15 sunken and listless. In wliatever degree these phenomena pre- sent themselves, tlie d3'senteric affection is accompanied at its A^ery ontsel, witli extreme, and often sudden, prostration, oppres- sion at tlie epigastrium, and a rapid increase of the evacuations. At first the mind is clear, or, if delirium is present, it is usually of the tranquil sort, l)ut in exceptional cases is maniacal. More generally the expression is stolid, vacant, careless, or apparently thoughtful; questions are answered but slowly, and there is no real delirium until the approach of death.

These cliaractcrs may vary in successive evacuations, and, par-

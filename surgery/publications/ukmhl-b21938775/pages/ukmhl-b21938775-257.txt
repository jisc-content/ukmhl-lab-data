'2a LTsefal and serviceable results, as a rule, arc hardly attain- able ill less than a year from the time of excision. Soldiers may occasional!}' return to a modilied duty iu a less period than this after removal of the head of the ljumerns or of the elbow-joint, but a slow convalescence is alone to be expected. The subjects of these operations arc tlierefore to be consid- ered as permanently invalided. In view of long hospital con- finejiient and protracted suppuration, it must be borne in mind, then, at the outset, tliat a patient may make a good recovery from a primary amputation when he will not sur- vive a secondary amputation required by the failure of an ill-advised excision.

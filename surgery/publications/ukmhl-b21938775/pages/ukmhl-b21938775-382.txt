8 Spanish visitations, among those suffering from venereal or chronic disease. Any occupation whicli tends to lower the standard of vitality, or any condition tending to depress the morale, is a powerfully determining cause of the malady. Ex- cessive indulgence in sexual intercourse should be especially regarded in the same light. AcGlimaiion.â€”Residence for a long time, in yellow fever countries, is acknowledged to exert a certain prophylactic influ- ence. Thus, " in healthy years, what are called sporadic cases, are confined to strangers. In years when the disease does not prevail so generally as to amount to an epidemic, the grave cases are confined to the unacclimated. In epidemics, the na- tives and old residents are frequently mildly attacked; but strangers are very generally seized, and have, in fact, to bear the violence and maliginity which belong to the fever." (Bart- lett.) A person may be said to be thoroughly acclimated wJio has previously had yellow fever. Instances, it is true, are recorded, in which two well-marked attacks have been observed; but the experience of all extensive observers goes to prove the ex- treme rarity of such exceptions to the general rule. It is highly probable that one attack is as completely protective against another, as in the case of small pox, and this independ- ently of the element of severity. The above remarks apply only to places more or less com- monly visited by yellow fever. In the Woodville epidemic of 1844, nearly every one, except a few who had previously'- had the disease, suffered from it. It is doubtful whether removal to and residence in countries exempt from y-ellow fever has the effect of lessening the pro- phylaxis by acclimation. Probably this would not impair the ordinary immunity from a second seizure.

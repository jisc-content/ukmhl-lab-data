Treatment of Periodical Dysentery.—Dysentery complicated with periodical fever is amenable to quinia in pi-oporlion to the predominance of the periodical type, that is to say, in pi'0])ortion to the distinctness with which there is a freedom from all active symptoms in the periods between the paroxysms. When the suspension of these symptoms is most complete, qiiinia alone will frequently, indeed generally, suffice to terminate the com- plex disease ; when, however, the dysenteric phenomena persist between the pei-iodical exacerl)ations, quinia may ari'cst the latter without innterially influencing the former. A compound trealment then l)ecomes necessary, in wliich, if gastric derange- ment is [)resent, an emetic dose of ipecacuanha and calomel (twenty grains of the former to ten or hftcen of the lattei') should be ])i'eniised, and when its opei'ation has ceased, quinia may be prescribed in solution, in the dose of from tlii'ce to five grains evei-y three or four hours, guarded l:iy four or five drop.« of laudanum in each dose, or accompanied by two oi' three grains of Dover's powder. If there is no disorder of the stomach the emetic of ipecacuanha may lie oinitled at the commencement of the treatment, and castor oil 1)0 sul)stiluted for the calomel. When the pei'iodical cliaraclcr of the disease has disa])))eared, the dysenteric symptoms, if any continue, should be managed in the manner already laid liown, and in accordance with the grade and type which they I lien present.

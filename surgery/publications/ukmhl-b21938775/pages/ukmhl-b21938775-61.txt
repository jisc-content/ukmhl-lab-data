14. In a case of gun-shot fracture of the upper arm, in which 8. A gnn-shot wound in the chest cannot close by adhesion^ and must remain open. The position of the sufierer should, therefore, be that which is most comfortable to him. A small hole penetrating the cavity is more dangerous than a large one, and the wound is less dangerous if the ball goes through the body. The wounds should be examined and enlarged if neces- sary, in order to remove all extraneous substances, even if they should be seen to stick on the surface of the lungs ; the opening should be covered with soft oiled or wet lintâ€”a bandage wlicn agreeable. The ear of the surgeon and the stethoscope are in- valuable aids, and ought always to be in use ; indeed no injury of the chest can be scientifically treated without them. 9. Incised and gun-shot wounds of the abdomen are to be treated in nearly a similar manner; the position in both being that which is most agreeable to the patient, the parts being re- laxed. In incised wounds of the abdominal parietes great care should be taken to include in the sutures all the tissues except the peritoneum. 11. In wounds of the bladder, an elastic or silver catheter is generally necessary. If it cannot be passed, an opening should be made in the perineum for the evacuation of the urine, with as little delay as possible. 12. In gun-shot fractures of the skull, the broken pieces of bone and all extraneous substances are to be removed as soon as possible, and depressed fractures of the bone are to be raised. A deep cut made by a heavy sword through the bone into the brain, generally causes a considerable depression of the inner table of the bone, whilst the outer may appear to be merely divided. 13. An arm is i>arely to be amputated, except from the effects of a cannon-shot. The head of the bone is to be sa\\Ti off, if necessary. The elbow joint is to be cut out, if destroyed, and the sufferer, in either case, may have a very useful arm.

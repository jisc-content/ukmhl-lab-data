13 tating, exliausting, and depressing causes, both physical and mental, and such as abound in camps, on board sliips, and in other places wlicrc human beings are crowded together. It seems not improbable tliat typhus fever (petecliial typlnis) is nothing more than this state in its simplicity, and carried to its extreme degree; for, in it no lesion of tlie solids can be found to explain its symptoms, except a tendency to disintegration, wliicli depends upon a previous disorder of the blood. But in all other diseases which present more or less analogous pheno- mena, tliere is also a local structural lesion which accounts for their specific (haracters, and distinguishes them from typhus fever. Typhoid fever is a blood disease, with dothinenteritis, and a more or less marked predominance of the typhoid state; and typhoid pneumonia an inflannnation of the lung, with the typhoid state superadded, and exerting a controlling influence on the local and general phenomena, and on tlie tendency of the local disease. Tiic eruptive fevers are very prone to assume this state, because, it may be presumed, in them, as in typhoid fever, the primary morbid change is in the blood itself. It is reasonable to suppose that, if exiernal circumstances favor, they will become complicated with that alteration of the circulating fluid which is characteristic of typhus fever, and that tliey will be more apt to liccome so than affections whose primai-y seat is in the solid ors-ans. Now, oliservation teaches us that bowel complaints arc more prevalent, as a general rule, than any other diseases in camps, barracks, hospitals, &c., because, in them the direct exciting causes of these complaints abound : from observation we also learn that in .such places, under circumstances peculiarly un- favorable to a vigorous performance of the functions, that all diseases, and those especially which afTcct the whole economy, tend to assume the typhoid type ; and, finally, we know that when tiiesc latter causes are greatly in excess, cases of pure typhus

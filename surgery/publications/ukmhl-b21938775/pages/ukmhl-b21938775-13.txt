0 Office Sanitary Commission, Washmjion, April 15, 1862. Tlie attention of the Sanitary Commission has been called to the fact that most of onr Army Surgeons now in the field are unavoidably deprived of many facilities they have here- tofore enjoyed for the consultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place within their reach anything that can be termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution, among the medical officers of the army, of a series of briel essays, or hand-books, embodying, in a condensed form, the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions which are likely to present themselves to sui'geons in the field, on the largest scale, and which are, therefore, of chief practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing papers on several subjects of this nature to certain of its associate members, in our principal cities, belonging to the medical profession. The following paper on "Pain and AniESthetics" is contributed as an introductory essay to the series, by the veteran chief of American surgery, Valentine Mott. FRED. LAW OLMSTED, Gen'I, f^ccrciary.

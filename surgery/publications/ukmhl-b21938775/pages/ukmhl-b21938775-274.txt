16 ticiilarly, stools containing the products of inflammation may alternate with others of a more or less fecal cliaracter. The urine is generally scanty and irritating, and occasions scalding in the urethra and strangury, and in some cases with a fatal tendency it is altogetlier suppressed. It may assume a brown color, due probably to dissolved blood-globules; and this is a grave indication. Tlie same remark applies to a fetid odor exhaled by tlie urine, the breatli, sputa, or perspiration, to a persistently bad, putrid, or saltish taste in the mouth ; to great and craving tliirst, or a sense of dryness in the mouth, when the tongue is moist, and to clamorous demand for drink in spite of its rendering the stools more frequent. In general the skin is dry and scaly, but it may also have a cold and sticky feel; and the nose, hands, and feet are often cold. Even when general perspiration occurs it is seldom critical. Petechias and vilnces may form, particularly upon the legs and arms ; pustules, blebs, and miliary vesicles are not unusual, and may be followed by ulcers. The gums may be swollen, dusky red, or bleeding ; and bleeding from the nose is not unusual. The pulse is feeble, l)ut its natural fre- quency is often unchanged materially. If it much exceed one hundred per minute the accompanying prostration is very great, or some complication (peritonitis usually) is forming. With tlie progress of the disease tlie hiccup, dysphagia, and debility increase ; the abdomen often swells, and the stools are passed involuntarily and unconsciously ; tlie tongue becomes iucrusLcd, and the teeth ai-c covered with dark and sonielimefi bloody sordcs; gangrene may attack the feet or parts subjected to pressure; and deatli takes place by exhaustion. If the dis- ease is fatal at an earlier stage coma or dclii-iiim may attend its close, which is sometimes hastened by erysipelas.

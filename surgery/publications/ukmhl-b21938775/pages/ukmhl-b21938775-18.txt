8 and in this way does nature herself in a manner dictate the use of anaesthetics. It was prohahly in supposed obedience to this indication that John Hunter, .great and ingetiious even in his errors, advocated amputation hefore reaction had occurred. He meant to avoid the nervous shock. In collapse, the return of nervous energy precedes the res- toration of the circulation ; and, admitting all that is claimed for the chemical origin of the forces which produce the cir- culation of the blood, we must still allow that the current is controlled and directed by nervous influence. The most severe operation during anaesthesia produces little or no effect upon the pulse, because the nervous centres receive little or no imj^ression "Whatever, then, may be the ph3'siological necessit}" for pain, though its uses in the animal econoni}^ ma}' he to pre- vent lesion and deter from dans-er, we are here to view the question merely in a therapeutic light, and to conclude that pain is only evil, and that continually. And now, how shall it he prevented ? Obviously by any means which will yno- duce a less injurious effect. We are not required to possess an absolutely innocuous agent; if the injurious effect of the means used be less than that of the pain prevented, we are justified in employing them. If we examine these doctrines carefully, wc shall find that they are in fact not essentially new. The principles on which they are founded have been long recognised m (he use of vairi)ii(:<^. I was in the habit of giving opiates freely before the introduction of anassthetics, both l)efore and after operations; and now, after over fiTty years of experience, I still retain them in my confidence, for their power to relieve pain after operations, thus iniproving the condition of the patient, and i'avoral)ly modiiying the subsequent intlamma-

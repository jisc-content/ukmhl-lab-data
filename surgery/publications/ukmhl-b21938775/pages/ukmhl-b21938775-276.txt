If diai'rhrea exists, as it usually does, the stools are by turns liilious. watery, or bloody, and sometimes consisi, of pure blood. Upon the sn.per- vention of dysentery, witli its abdominal pains, tenesmus, and more frerpicnt stools, the scorbutic symptoms proper, if sli^-ht, arc not always aggravated, but arc rendered more intractable; but if already well developed they coincide wilh those of the dysentery itself, and the union of the two moi'hid pi'ocesses rapidly undermines tlie strength by completely sul)verting the reparative functions of tlic economy. Generally the complex disease then assumes tlic form of typhoid dysentery, willi an aggravation of all the symptoms v/hich de}iend upon a dissolu- tion of the blood. Among the other complications, and wliich need not liei'C be described, because they do not form any ]iroper union \\-ith the dysenteric symptoms, arc rlienmatism, dijildherhi. and parol His.

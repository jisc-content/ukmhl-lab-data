Tlie clotli unfolded, if in one piece, sliould tlien lie immersed in the solution and thorou<;'ldy saturated. It is tlien to be folded and laid on a flat surface, sucli as a board or table, and smoothed out M-ith the hand, in order to remove anv irre"'ularities of its surface, and then, with the help of an assistant, ap])lied to the lind), and a roller bandage put on snug-l}' over it. The lind) is then t(j be held in proper position (extension being made, if necessary, l)j the surgeon) until the plaster solidities. The time recpiired in preparing the cloth, mixing the plaster, and a])pljing it to the lind), need not take more than fifteen minutes. After the dressing has become hard, it is best to i-emove the I'oller and re-apply it more loosely, and in many cases it may be dispensed with altogether. Cold water and othei* lotions may be freely applied to the exposed portions of the liml) without injury to the splint. This dressing may be used with advantage in fi-actures of the humerus, forearm, and leg, and injuries involving the elbow, knee, and ankle joints. After excisions, there is no form of dressing which is so applicable. We M-ill now describe its application to special fractures, connnencing with Fractures of the Leg.â€”The limb should be shaven or lightly oiled, and the wounds covered with lint. A piece of Canton flannel should then be selected, of a size so that when doubled it should be wide enough to encircle tlie leg for a little more than half its circumference, and of suthcient length to extend from below the knee to about five inches below the heel. In order to make the splint fit the lind) neatly, it is a good plan to cut the Canton flannel after a paper pattens previously ai prepared. The shape of this pattern is represented in fig. 1. Openings should be cut at the proper places, so as to Fiy.i.

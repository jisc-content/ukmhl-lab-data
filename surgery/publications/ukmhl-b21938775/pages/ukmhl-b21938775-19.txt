9 tion. In the treatment of certain pninfiil aff'octionf!, sneli as puerpoi'al fever or peritonitis, o[)inm is well known not only to be [jalliative, but directly cnraHve. Ricliter called it "the gi-and antipldogistic r.emed}'." It has always been used more freely by surgeons in tliis country than in Europe, and to tliis cause I attribute, in great measure, our lesser subsequent mortality. A nd opium aud its preparations are the oidy anodynes well adapted to surgical use. Ko substitutes are worthy of contldcnce. Wlien chloroform or fether is to be used, it is not advisable to give au oi)iate previous to the operation, as to do so woidd increase the tendency to saibscqucnt vomiting, which ever}' experienced surgeon is anxious to avoid. A\'^lien the system is laboi-ing under tlie sliock of any ncwly-i'eceived aud severe injiuy, tlie powers of life are in abeyance, and the act of I'ctching tends to an unfortunate issue. In col- lapse, if the patient vomit, he is apt to die. In cases of hare lij), however, aud in operations about the mouth ami jaws and nose, we are fre(picntly comitelled to depend, as formerly, upon narcotics for preventing or miti- gating the pain, as the locality renders inhalation imprac- ticable. After o[)ei"ations, opiates are to be used, without much reference to fpumtity in propoi'tion to the severity of the pain. The only injurious effect of their too free exhibition would be al'ter s<ime hours a little irritability of the stoniach. Tl leir constijiating tendency in such cases is of no thei'a- pcntic importance, aud would in no degree increase the subsequent local inliamnuttion. Ali-oliiihc sllnnihiil.s are also well known to cxei'cise a limited ana'sllictie power. Men in a condition of complete inloxi- cation are somelikues unconscious of the injui'ies they receive,

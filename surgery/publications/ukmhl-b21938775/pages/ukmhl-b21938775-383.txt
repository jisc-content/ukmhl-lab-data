9 Onr knowledge concerning epidemic influences is nltoo-ether too vagne to arrest our attention here, Nor can we foretell whether or not the yellow fever will prevail in any given yearj from our present acquaintance with its nature and history. It were equally unprofitable to enter upon the discussion (Tf tlic numerous theories advanced to explain its essential cause. It is to be hoped that the day may ai'rive when our ignorance on those points will be enlightened. It is very certain that it has not yet come. Miasmatic fevers have only to be understood to be distin- guished, at once, from the disease under consideration. The following table will explain the principal differences between them : Miasmatic Fever. 1st. Exists in the hottest and coldest climates. 2d. Affects country localities by pre- ference; rare in cities. 8d. One attack invites another. 4th. Curable by Peruvian bark or its preparations. Yellow Fever. 1st. Does not flourish in either intense heat or cold. 2d. Eminently a disease of cities and large gatherings of human beings. 3d. One attack prevents another. 4th. Not curable by these means. Finally, in many parts of the world scourged by visitations from malarious fevers, yellow fever is unknown. Contagiousness and Communicahility.â€”Tliese nnich vexed points have been most elaborately and learnedly discussed. From the present state of our knowledge, we may fairly infer : Ist. That there is no danger in allowing contact between per- isons ill of yellow fever and others in good health, the latter being in places where the disease does not exist epidemically. 2d. It is extremely probable that certain articles of merchan- dise, of dress, and of bedding (fomites) convey a material which, under peculiar circumstance, tends to develop the fever.

8 the bone is much splintered, incisions are to be made for the removal of all the broken pieces which it is feasible to take away. The elbow is to be supported. The forearm is to be ti-eated in a similar manner ; the splints nsed should be solid. 15. The hand is never to be amputated, unless all or nearly all its parts are destroyed. Different bones of it, and of the wrist, are to be removed when irrecoverably injured, with or without the metacarpal bones and lingers, or the thumb ; but a thumb and one finger should be preserved when possible. 16. The head of the thigh bone should be sawn off when broken by a musket ball. Amputation at the hip joint should Duly be done when the fracture extends some distance into the shaft, or the limb is destro^'cd by cannon shot. [There is little encouragement for the performance of primary amputation or re- section at the hip joint.] 17. The knee joint should be cut out when irrecoverably in- jured ; but the limb is not to be amputated until it cannot be avoided. 18. A gun-shot fractm-e of the middle of the thigh, attended by great splintering, is a case for amputation. In less difficult cases, the splinters should be removed by incisions, particulai-ly when they can be made on the upper and outer side of the thigh. The limb should be placed on a straight, firm splint. A broken thigh does not admit of much, and sometimes of no extension, â– without an unadvisable increase of suficring. An inch or two of shortening in the thigh does not so materially interfere with progression as to make the suftcrer regret having escaped amputation. [The sufferings of the patient will be greatly al- leviated by judicious extension with strips of adhesive plaster, and a more useful limb will thus be secured.] 19. A leg -injured below the knee should rarely be ampu- tated in the first instance, unless from the eficcts of a cannon shot. The splintcrtj of bone lu-e all to be immediately rC'

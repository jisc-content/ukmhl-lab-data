10 and formerly some surgeons were In the lialjit of benumbing the sensibility of the patient, and sometimes I fear their own, by copious draughts of spirituous liquors. But this practice can, at best, produce Ljut very imperfect anfesthesia, and intoxicating drinks afe than opium still more apt to disturb the stomach. I well remember a case of amputation of the thigh which occurred a few years since in my own practice, where the attending physician, notwithstanding repeated cautions, administered brandy to the patient so freely as to induce vomiting, thus interfering with the con- tinuance of the reaction, and inducing a fatal result. It was au extensive cannon shot of the knee joint, and on the third day from the injury,_ before the collapse had sufficiently passed off. But opium and alcohol have been referred to, rather as illustrations of the truth of the principles of anrestliesia than as practicable ancesthetic agents. To produce any considerable insensibility with them would require their use in quantities and for a length of time that could not fail to be seriouslj- injurious to the nervous system. Bays would be required to recover from their narcotic effect. Hence it is, that such agents are of little account when compared with inhalations. The great extent of the pulmonary surface, and the facility with which a!riforra agents may be introduced through it into the circulation—their complete efficiency and their ready evacuation by respiration—conclusively indicate that the lungs, instead of the stomach, is the best route through which to introduce the proper agents for inducing insensibilty. Now, the question arises, can these advantages be secured without danger to the patient? And sufficient time has already' elapsed to enal)le us to reply: AjiivsthclicSy when properly used, are pcrfedbj safe. >

MILITARY HYGIENE AND TH KRAPEUTICS. 9 tieiits, waiting until places can be found for them in tlic hospitals. This regiment is badly slieltered, and presents all the causes of disease in an exaggerated state. Among the other regiraentSyi the 57th has nearly 200 sick, the 10th has 150, the 61st '200, the 6th dragoons 40, 7th dragoons 30, 4th hussars 60, infantry of marine 20, engineers 13, artillery 100. In all these regi- ments there is not a single case of sickness among the otticers, who are better lodged and led." The whole number of French troops sent to the army of the East, as already mentioned, was 3'J9,2|)8 : the whole number of deaths was 69,22!J; of this num- ber there were 7,500 who were killed on the battle-field, or not afterwards heard from. The total attacks of cholera in the French army of the East amounted to 18,400. Of this number 11,000 were fatal. Attacks 1 to 15 of the army; deaths 1 to l-f'o tli'^ cases. The total attacks of typhus were about 35,0(10; total deaths from the same disease 17,515. The whole number of cases of diarrhoea was 19,339, of dysentery 6,105. Scurvy prevailed to a great extent during the severe cold of winter, and during the sultry heat of summer, but almost dis- appeared during the spring and autumn. Scrive says that the single efficient cause of scurvy was the absence of fresh vegetables." lie adds, " Scurvy, like typhus, can be created at will."

Among the wounded in battle, 1 in 5 died on the field, the proportion being the same in the three battles of Alma, Inkernian, and Traktir Bridge. The proportion of amputations was about 1 out of 6 wounded. During the tii'st five or six weeks of the siege the health of the troops was good, and the wounds pursued a favorable course; at a later period the wounds did not do so well. Fi 'om the tacts which have been presented, it is very evident that the lives of military men are much more endangered by disease than by wounds received in battle. It is, tlien, one of the highust duties of an army surgeon to make himself well acquainted with the correct principles of military hygiene, and to exert his influence to the greatest possible extent in promo- iiig the health and physical energy of the soldiers who are in-

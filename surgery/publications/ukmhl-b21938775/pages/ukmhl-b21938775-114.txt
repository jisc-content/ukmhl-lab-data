APPENDIX. SIGNS OF SUCCESSFUL VACCINATION ^ND OF SUCCESSFUL REVACCINATION. (Gkegob, revised by Ceely and Maeson.*) (A.) " When vaccination has been snccessfullj performed the puncture may be felt elevated on the Becond or third day, and soon afterwards, if examined with a magnifying glass, appears surrounded by a slight redness. On the fifth or sixth day a distinct vesicle is formed, having an elevated edge and depressed centre. On the eighth day it appears distended witli a clear lymph. The vesicle, on this its day of greatest perfection, is circular and pearl-colored ; its margin is turgid, firm, shining, and wheel shaped. Late on the seventh, or early on the eighth day, an inflamed ring or areola begins to form around the base of the vesicle, and, with it, conlinnes to in- crease during the two following days. This areola is of a cir- cular form, and its diameter extends from one to three inches. When at its height, on the ninth or tenth day, there is often considerable hardness and swelling of the subjacent cellular membrane. On the tenth or eleventh dav the areola begins to subside, leaving, as it fades, two or three concentric circles of redness. The vesicle now begins to dry in the centre, and acquires there a brownish color. The lymph which remains becomes opaque, and gradually concretes; so that about the fourteenth or fifteenth day the vesicle is converted into a hard round scab of a reddish-brown color. This scab contracts, dries, blackens, and about the twenty-first day falls ofl". It * Second Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, 1859. (Blue Book), Loudon.

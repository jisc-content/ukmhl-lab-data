6 CONTINUED FEVEKS. I. IRPJTATIYE FEVER. (Syu.) Simple Fever, Ephemera, Febricula. A fever lasting only abont twenty-four hours lias been described by some writers under the name of Ephemera as distinct from Febricula ; but they nuxy be better treated as gradations of the same disease passing by insensi- ble degrees into each other, and difleriiig only in intensity. By tlie term Irritative Fever is meant that condition of the system which is manifested by a hot skin, a quick pulse, and white tongue, &c., continuing from two to seven or eiglit days, and referable, so far as our powers of observation go, to Jio pe- culiar or specific agency or local disease as its cause. CoiiKSE AND Syjiptoms.-—It begins with rigors, generally slight, often imperfectly marked yet sonaetimes severe, followed by chilliness, headache, pain in back and limbs, and soon suc- ceeded by ordinary febrile I'caction—a dry, hot skin, frequent 23ulsc, furred tongue, loss of appetite, thirst, constipation, scanty urine, and diminution of the secretions generally. There is no cough, nor physical signs of the chest or abdomen. The symp- toms increase in severity for three or four days, and after five, six, or seven days disappear as suddenly as they began,-—a. critical discharge, a deposit of urates or a copious sweat, in many cases, marking the moment when the patient regains his health. Causks.—Very numerous; exposure to cold or intense heat, errors of diet, a debauch, ovcM-exertiou and fatigue, the pres- en(-e ol' febrile epidemics, Soldiers, after a fatiguing march (ixposed to cold and wet, if they afterwards remain with theii- damp clothes upon them, are apt to be thus attacked. PuooNosrs.—Uncomplicated, it is never fatal; local inflam- mations are oeeasionally set up in its course.

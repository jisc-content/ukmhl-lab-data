nourishment be demanded, veal, cliicken, or beef broth is ad- visable. Should collapse occur, or seem threatening, it is to be met by stimulation. Iced brandy toddy, or mint julep, judiciously given, will usually be taken with readiness and easily re- tained, where the stomach is not utterly rebellious. For nourishment, nothing is better than the animal broths, just mentioned. In case of failure to retain them, when adminis- tered by the moutli, we can often advantageously employ them by injection. Among the most distressing symptoms are nausea and vomit- ing. Rest to the stomach—the use of small doses of morphine —of prussic acid—of creosote, one drop every hour or two— of solution of camphor in chloroform, (ounce for ounce,) in two drop doses, every hour, given in mucilage—of acetate of lead—of carbonic acid—minim doses of muriatic or nitro- muriatic acid—rubefacients or epispastics to epigastrium—and, finally, the endermic or hypodermic application of opium or its salts, are among the means best calculated to afibrd relief. Many recommendations have been made as to the proper treatment in black vomit. In this event, let the stomach aloae^ 80 far as ingesta are concerned. Digestion is checked, and probably absorption is impossible. The exceptional cases of recovery, after this symptom, are due to non medicinal in- fluences. It would be useless to devote especial consideration to the subject of prophylaxis, after what has already been said con- cerning the etiology. The predisposing causes, and those which we call exciting, as far as we know, have been men- tioned. Do what is possible to escape their influences. For the Committee, John T. Mktoalfio, M. D.

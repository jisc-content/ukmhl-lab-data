6 6th. Forests, or even woods, have the power of obstructing and preventing its transmission, under these circumstances. 7th. By atmospheric currents, it is capable of being trans- ported to considerable distances—probably as far as five miles. Sth. It may be developed, in previously healthy places, by turning up the soil; as in making excavations for foundations of houses, tracks for railroads, and beds for canals. 9th. In certain cases, it seems to be attracted and. absorbed by bodies of Avater lying in the course of such winds as waft it from the miasmatic source. 10th. Experience alone can enable us to decide as to the presence or absence of malaria, in any given locality. 11th. In proportion as countries, previously malarious, are cleared up and thickly settled, periodical fevers disappear. In many instances, io be replaced by the typhoid or typhus. 11th. We possess, in our materia medica, an antidote to the malarious poison, as well as a prophylactic against it, 13th. The propinquity of large fires will often prevent the injurious effects of malaria. Inasmuch as the fevers due to miasmatic influence are iden- tical in nature, it has been thought well to give brief descrip- tions of the different varieties, reserving the treatment for sub- sequent consideration, when the special therapeutics of each will be mentioned. These varieties, mutually convertible, one into the other, are known as the intermittent, the remittent, and a third, partaking generally of the first, but occasionally of the second, and best known, in the United States, as the congestive. Of the intermittent fevers, known in this country as " ague," "fever and ague," "chills and fever,"—characterized by an entire cessation of febrile phenomena, during a certain time, we have several types: 1st. Tlie quotidian, occurring once in every twenty-four hours, and commencing about the same time of day. 2d. The tertian, occurring once every other day, with a

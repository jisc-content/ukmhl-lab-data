TYPHUS FEVER. 23 tlie flagging energies, may sometimes be arrested in desperate cases. Local Comi'licatioxs and incidental affections, occurring in the acute stage, are to be treated topically but judiciously, bearing in mind the adynamic tendency of the primary disease. During convalescence, too much care as to premature exposure, or indiscretions ill diet, cannot be observed. The appetite is to be restrained. Demulcent drinks, solutions of gum arable, and infusions of flaxseed, in conjunction ^vith bland but untriiious food, seem avcU adapted to this period. Ale and porter are here of adyantage, in many cases, if they can be got. Thus by care and consideration, the intractable secondary diarrhcea ^vhich belongs to the rccoyering stage, may be avoided, at the same time that the strength of the patient is sustained and increased. The preceding paper, prepared by Dr. J. Baxter Upham, of Boston, is recommended for jniblication to the United States Sanitary Commission, by the Medical Commission of the State of Massachusetts.

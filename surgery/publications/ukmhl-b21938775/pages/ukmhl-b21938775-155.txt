21 portion of os caleis acting as a foreign body, it usnally unites easily and firmly to the tibia. In London tlie operation lias been performed by Mr. Ure of St. Mary's, by Mr. Simon of St. Thomas, by Messrs. Busk, Tudor, and Croft at tlie Dread- nought, and by Mr. Fergusson and Mr. Partridge in King's College; all of whom have, I believe, been, on the whole, well satisfied with its results. At the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Dr. McGhee, the Medical Superintendent, showed me a case in which it had been performed seven weeks previously. The stamp was just healed, and promised to be an excellent one. It was, I understand, the first case in Glasgow in which that operation had been adopted." The objections generally raised to -this operation, are thus summed up by Mr. Syme, in comparing it with his own method. He alleges that " this operation deprives kis of all its advan- tages in the first place, by rendering it complicated instead of extremely simple; secondly, by making the stump too long; thirdly, by imjjairing its constitution ; fourthly, by retaining a portion of the osseous tissue justly liable to the suspicion of relapse; and fifthly, by not being applicable to all cases requir- ing amputation at the ankle." The preceding opinions quoted from surgeons who have had experience in this operation, prac- tically refute these objections. They all regard Pirogofi:''s ope- ration as the more simple; the greater length of the limb is considered an advantage to the poor man who has no artificial limb ; the stump is thought to be more sound and serviceable; the liability of the osseous portion of the flap to necrosis is denied; it is deemed applicable to all cases suitable for Syme's operation, provided only the posterior portion of the os calcis is not diseased. Pirogolf's operation has now been performed upwards of twelve times by the surgeons of Great Britain ; and all who have ope- rated, have spoken favorably of it.

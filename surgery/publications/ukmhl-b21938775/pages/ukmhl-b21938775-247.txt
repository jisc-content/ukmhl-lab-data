13 WRIST-JOINT. Under the title of this excision are to be included all ope- rations which excise a part or the whole of the ends of the radius and ulna, a part or the whole of the carpus, the proxi- mal ends of the metacarpal bones, or even all of these to- gether. It will at once be seen that in this operation the first law of excisions can rarely be fulfilled, viz : that, togeth- er with the partial or complete removal of the articular ex- tremities of the bones, there shall be a free exposure or destruction of the synovial cavity of the joint. Of all the principal excisions performed for disease, that of this joint is the one on which least reliance is placed. la default of experience, therefore, the inference is that in mili- tary surgery it will furnish still less favorable results. The "wrist" was excised three times during the* Crimean war, with one fatal result, and the end of the radius has been quite a number of times successfully removed in cases of compound dislocation. There is consequently precedent sufficient, perhaps, to authorize renewed trials in cases not accompanied by too great laceration of the soft parts. Operation.—The removal of any part of the wrist-joint, for gun-shot injury, can hardly be accomplished without division of the extensor tendons; indeed, the lesion prompt- ing interference will probably have already eflected this. The fractured bones must be patiently dissected out, and the detachment ol' fragments will in most cases constitute the whole operation. The end of the radius may, perhaps, admit of removal with the saw. After-treatment.—This is to be conducted upon general principle's; but after the first few days, the fingers and the thumb should be kept semi-flexed by resting upon some rounded body, (a roller bandage, for instance,) so that, if any motion is retained, their approximation may be more readily accomplished. Passive motion of the fingers cannot be attempted for considerable time after the operation, but

14 VACCINATION IN ARMIES. From a paper on smallpox and vaccination, read before the JBoston Sanitary Association by Robert Ware, M.D., and pre- sented to tlie Senate and Ilonse of Representatives of Massa- chusetts, we learn that in Boston, in 1721, the year in which inoculation was introduced, and when the population of Boston was only 11,000, there were 5,759 cases of smallpox, of which Sll were fatal. Thus it appears that over one-half the inhab- itants had the disease, and one thirteenth died of it. In 1730 there were 4,000 cases and 200 deaths. In 1752, when the population was 15,684, the number of cases was 5,545 and the deaths 539. Again, in 1764, there were 5,646 cases ; in 1776, 5.292; and in 1792, 8,346. If we turn now to the period subsequent to the introduction of vaccination, and take the fifteen years between 1815 and 1830, when vaccination was, in a measure, compulsory and the restrictive system of isolation in force, we find the mortality of smallpox to amount to on\y fou7'teen deaths. A still longer period, from 1811 to 1839, shows that only fifty-two deaths from this disease occurred. Not only is it shown by the above statistics that the wor- tality of smallpox is diminished, but that the frequency of epidemics is also greatly reduced. In the report of the Epi- demiological Society of London, prepared by Dr. Seaton, it is shown that during the ninety-one years (1650-1741) previous to inoculation, there had been 65 distinct and well-marked epi- demics, which is a ratio of 71.4 epidemics in one hundred years. During sixty-three years (1741-1803) in which inoculation was practised, and that to a great extent, there were 53 distinct and well-marked epidemics, which is a ratio of 89 epidemics in one hundred years. During the last fifty years, since vaccination has been prac- tised and inoculation declared illegal, there have been twelve epidemics of smallpox, which is a ratio of 24 epidemics in one hundred years. Whence it appears that smallpox was epidemic in London before inoculation as 42; dui'ing inoculation as 54; during , vaccination as 14. {/hid., p. 35.) lu concluding this branch of the subject, your committee

15 4th. The albumen is also dimuiished in quantity. 5th. The amount of inorganic constituents is very niateriall}' lessened, principally through the diminution in the quantity of 2^otc(sh, lime^ and iron normally present in the l^lood. These are the chief alterations Avhich (as several analyses of the blood have enabled- us to ascertain) attend the pres- ence of scurvy. It is scarcely reasonable to hold the opinion that any one of these alterations in the normal character of the blood is the immediate cause of the scorbutic diathesis. Garrod be- lieves that a deficiency of potash in the system is the cause of scurvy. We confess to having once held a similar opin- ion, but more extensive observation has satisfied us of its incorrectness. The fact, that under the influence of i)otash scurvy disappears, is no valid argument in support of the theory in question, for, as we have ascertained, iron also effects a cure and with as much rapidity as potash. No doubt the deficiency of potash is an important point in the pathology of the disease, but it is to all the alterations in the normal constitution of the blood that we are to look for the immediate cause of the scorbutic diathesis. We have seen that it is more than probable the immediate or essential cause of scruvy is a morbid alteration in the constitution of the blood. We come, in the next place, to consider the predisposing or exciting cause. It was formerly held that the long-continued use of salt food was the chief cause of the development of scurvy. There was apparently just ground for this opinion, for the disease was observed chiefly among those Avho for long periods were subjected to this kind of diet. It is now, however, very well established that the use of salt food alone will not ordinarily excite the disease. Along with

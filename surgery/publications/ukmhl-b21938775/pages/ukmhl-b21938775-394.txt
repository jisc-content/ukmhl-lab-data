20 stage continuing for a day or two, and tlien, accompanied or followed by epigastric pain and distress; nausea and vomiting; restlessness and anxiety, often more or less paroxysmal; and, in from three to five days after the attack, by yellowness of the eyes and skin ; vomiting of matter resembling coflee-grounds, held in a dark colored fluid ; very dark or black stools ; cold- ness of the extremities; increasing and excessive restlessness, with occasional hiccough, hsemorrhages from different parts of* the body, and suppression of urine—the mind, in many in- stances, remaining clear to the end, and death taking place in from five to seven days from the attack—these phenomena, thus combined, and thus following each other, constitute a dis- ease which it seems impossible to mistake for any other.— (Bartlett.) Of the Pathological anatomy of yellow fever, much has been made known, while much still remains for future research. Cadaveric rigidity is usually well marked. In general, the surface of the body and conjunctiva are yellow, the color being commonly most marked in the face and trunk. As epiphenom- ena, traces of inflammation may be met with in diSerent parts of the body. The hloodj has been more satisfactorily examined by Doctor Blair than by any other observer. He has moreover, the merit of having made his observations in fluid taken from the patients during life. In the first stage, nothing abnormal was found, except an occasional admixture with bile. The alkaline reaction was always observed. Only in the last stages and post mortem, were changes observed. And yet, cases termin- ating fatally, after normal black vomit and hasmorrhages were numerous, in which no abnormal condition, save this bilious tinge, could be detected. Ou the other hand, certain observa- tions showed great changes to have taken place in the circulat- ing fluid, during the last stages. " Scarcely any fibrine,"

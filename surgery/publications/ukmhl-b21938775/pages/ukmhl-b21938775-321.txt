19 makes its appearance where an abundance of sucli food can be obtained. It is not, however, to be inferred that scurvy does not occasionally appear among people who cat a great deal of fresh vegetable food. In such cases the moral and physical causes we have mentioned are so strong as to over- come every resistance. Dr. PincoflFs, in the work from which we have quoted, says-that '''Turks who eat but little meat and a great deal of fruit suffered greatly with scurvy. Dr. Leudersdoff, who had charge of a Turkish hospital during the Crimean war, had sixty, of his beds filled witli scorbutic cases, and the same, he says, was the case with all the hos- pitals, large and small, at Eupatoria. There are many examples on record of the disease appearing when fresh vegetables were supplied in abundance." Perhaps a more influential cause than a salt-meat diet or the mere deprivation of fresh vegetable food, is found in the sameness of diet to which soldiers and sailors are so frequently subjected. The following extract from a work* we have already quoted from, places the whole subject of food as a cause of scurvy in its true position : "It has hitherto been too constantl}^ supposed, at least by the community in general, that scurvy is mainly, if not altogether, to be attributed to the use of salt provisions, and that it is little to be apprehended unless these form a large proportion of the daily food ; but the fact is, para- doxical as it may appear, that it would be extremely diffi- cult to prove that scurvy has any other closer connection with the use of salt meat than of fresh meat, for the disease is observed not alone Avhen salt provisions constitute the * Medical and Surgical History of the British Army, wliicli served iu Turlcey and the Crimea, &c., vol.

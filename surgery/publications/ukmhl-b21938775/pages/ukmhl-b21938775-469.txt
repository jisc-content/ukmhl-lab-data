7 " to set," loliile heiny held hij the surgeon in its lyropev jjosi- tion,; the starcli apparatus requiring several clays to diy un- less artificial lieat is applied. Anotlier advantage is, tliat tlie limb can be inspected daily if necessary, without removing all tlie a])paratus. It, therefore, can be applied much earlier tlian the starch bandao-e. This form of dressing tor tractures, used ;is a means of trans- porting the Avounded, has been but little used in this wai-. Dr. Swan applied it to several cases of fractures after the seven days' light before Richmond, during M'Clellan's cam- paign, and the patients were comfortal)ly transported to Wash- ington. Louis Stromeyer Little, Assistant Surgeon to London Hospi- tal, writing from the seat of war at Schleswig, states that " Plaster of Paris is universally employed in compound frac- tures. In ten of the femur particularly, it answered very well; the patient could bear to have the limb moved aljout, and all seemed in a fair way to recover."'^ In military surgery, the advantages it possesses o\'er other forms of dressings are the rapidity with which it dries and adapts itself to the parts, and the fact that it forms such a firm, hard casing, permitting the Hndj to be handled and moved with great ease during any transportation that may l)e iieces- sary to place the patient in more comfortable f[uarters. And if applied so as to leave a portion of the limb uncovered, there is no danger from swelling. Windows can be cut in the splint, so as to allow the wounds to be exposed and dressed. Cooling lotions may be applied without injury to the dressings. Materials necessary for the A2yplication of Plaster of Paris jSjjlints on the Field. 1st. Old coarse muslin, or Canton flannel. 2d.

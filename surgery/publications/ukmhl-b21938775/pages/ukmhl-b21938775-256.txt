22 l)ility in tlic distal iiuikos the fiiigei- u useful one. A stiff, straight finger is always in the way, and i)atients themselves will oftentimes ultimately solicit their ani[»utation. In the foot, the anchylosis and abl^reviation, the scars and prominences whieli are left by excisidn, interfere with com- fort wlien the shoe is worn ; and although tlie foot requires a broad surface to sustain weiglit, and a certain length for easy walking, it can Ijetter bear tlie loss of a toe than i)res- sure on an iri'egular and tender cicatrix. Excisions of large joints are never to be practiced on the battle-field, or under conditions which wmU require the im- mediate transportation of the wounded. It is only in station- ary hospitals, or under circumstances where the sick can be left behind, that they are to be attempted. Exceptions to this rule may sometimes be made for excisions of the up[)er extremity; but even in these, unless considerable time has elapsed, removal can hardly fail to cause displacement of the parts, inflammation of the wound, and the consequent train of abscesses, constitutional disturbance, and, it may be, of graver accidents,—pyaMiiia, myelitis, necrosis, etc. Patients with excised joints are, however, al\Yays*to be transfered, at the earliest suitable opportunity, from regimental to general hospitals, where tliey can remain undisturbed till recovery has taken place. After an excision a successful issue depends upon constant •personal superintendence on the part of the surgeon, and a continued call upon his patience and ingenuity is made by the requirements of necessary apparatus, or the varying modifications wdiich it demands, and upon his judgment, either in maintaining absolute rest, if anchylosis is desired, or in regard to the time when passive motion shall be com- menced, the frequency with which it shall be applied, and the indefatigable perseverance with which it shall be follow- ed up when active local symptoms have subsided.

12 By tlio use of anrestlietics, also, the shrieks and cries of the piitieiit are prevented; so tliat tlie snrgeon's powers are not additionally taxed, either to nerve himself to a very uniilensniit task, or to control and encourage the attendants. This discovery, then, has not only taken from surgery its greatest liorrors, but it has also very much increased tlie facility nnd safety of operations; and in this way the, domain of surf/crt/ is cxtcrided. In the removal of tumors with inti'icate surgical relations, the operator iio\V'feels at liberty to take the amount of time required for careful and slow dissection. lie performs pain- ful operations on children with little or no fear of subsequeut convulsions, and the nervous and timid are so protected from tilt! shock that he is free to assert the dominion of the knife wherever science has decreed and the powers of the human (^institution will allow. But it is tlie object of this paper not oidy to show the propi'iety of inducing insensibility to pain, but also to give some plain and practical Directions for the use of Ancesthcfics. Of these agents, only two—asther and chloroform—are as yet worthy of consideration; and of these I have always preferred chloroform, for the reason that it is more etlective. ^iher has been supposed to be safer in the hands of the inex|u:iieiu'ed, but this is clearly no reason why the prac- ticed sui'gcou should conline himself to the weaker and luova inconvenient agent. yEther is longer in juHHlucing ames- thesia, is more bulky, and in some cases fiils to [U'oiliice the desired elfect. I am in the habit, howevei', of employing both, cH)min()nly commencing with a'ther, and resmliiig to chh^rolbrm if insensibility is not readily induced.

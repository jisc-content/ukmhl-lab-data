These latter were not always to be detected, and yet there could be no doubt in regard to the scorbutic character of the disease, for it alwa3's readily yielded to anti-scorbutic treatment, and as obstinately resisted that directed against the obvious characteristics. But perhaps the most common symptom of scurvy, liable to lead to an erroneous diagnosis which the writer has witnessed, was one similating what ordinarily passes under the name of chronic rheumatism. This consisted of very severe pains in the muscles of the legs and back, increasing in severity towards evening. The appearance of the skin was not in the least altered for some time, neither was there any particular tenderness of the gums. The muscles were not permanently conti-acted nor abnormally hard- The progress of the disease was in many of these cases arrested at this point by appropriate treatment, but in others it passed on to Avell-developed scurvy. There is,, we think, but little doubt that many of the cases designated in the medical reports as chronic rheumatism are in reality of a scorbutic nature. In the olBcial work* from which we have already quoted, mention is thus made in regard to the point in question : "One of the most constant precursory symptoms of scurvy was an obscure form of muscular rheumatism. The individual complained of pains in his legs of an aching character, and his movements were tedious and painful; there was in these cases no articular inflammation observed, and though the feet and legs were generally oedematous, there was little enlargement of the ankle joints ; the afl'ec- Â« Medical ancT Surgical History of the British Army, &c., &c., p. 175.

Convalescence.—Chronic Dysentery.—Dysentery is ])e- culiarly subject to relapses, even after its mildest attacks, unless great care be taken of the patient's regimen. The simplest form, indeed, if not ver}' impropeidy Iroaled, is followed by a speedy return to health, but even slight errors of diet, will occasion abdomiiml ])a,in and diai'rhcea ami perlnips some ten- esmus and diarrliooa, and somel.iines loss of power in liie sphincter aui. A tendency to sweating, ])arl,iciilai-ly at night, is fre(iuent ; the hair is apt to fall out ; boils may foiau in vari- ous parts of the body ; and abscesses about the anus and licmorrhoids arc not uncomniDn. If the patient remains in the place v/hcre the disease was contracted, the cure of se\i're dysenlcry is slow and difficult i!fven under the most; a|ipriipriate regimen, and withont this a rela|ise may occur even aflei- his removal to a more salidjrious locality. ^J'he intestinal nhcrs do not completely heal, and ttu; discharges are more or less constantly mucoiis, serous, purulent, or bloody ; the food passes rapidly through the bowels and is often discharged undigested; emaciation is persistent and extreme, and accom|)anied with liectii; symptoms; and occasionally perforation of the liowcl near ihe segmoid flexure of the colon lakes place. iMore fre- qu.-ntly thickening affects the coals of the bowel in this region, forming a stricture. These are the prominent phenonuMia of chronic di/scntenj. 7;«ra^w?i.—Simple acute dysentery of a mild tyi)e lasts from one to two weeks before complete convalescence is established.

i ON HEMORRHAGE FROM WOUNDS. kind more generally diffused, what a multitude of lives in the aggregate might be saved ! It is true, notwithstanding all that has been done bj the very admirable surgical and sanitary departments of our immense army, that many soldiers still perish on the field of battle from hemorrhage, or are so much reduced as to preclude their subse- quent recovery. Humanity and, patriotism are deploring, with more than ordinary sorrow, this waste of precious human life, and I have thought, that if some means were taken to disseminate among the of&cers and men a little rudimentary knowledge of where to apply constriction to the limbs for arresting hemor- rhage from wounds, and perhaps to provide them with some simple and cheap means of doing this, no injury could result to any per- son, and this great cause of mortality might be to some extent diminished. Of the various forms of death, that by hemorrhage is to our natural instincts one of the most appalling. The associations are all of them revolting—suggestive of the shambles. The glaze of the eye, the ashen hue of the countenance, the cold dewy perspiration, and, withal, the nauseous odor of gore, are sufficient to carry an instinctive shudder to the stoutest heart. To these is added the pain of the wound, and as long as that wound remains open and ready to bleed, though reaction may come on and restore the sufferer to consciousness and life, it is only to experience again the same horrors—the agonies of suc- cessive deaths, until Nature fails, and the imprisoned spirit takes its final flight. My heart sinks, to think how many of our noble Volunteers have passed through these portals in the dark and chilly night after the battle, with no friend near to aid or even pity them, yet fearlessly and bravely have passed through into the regions of immortality beyond 1 The means of arresting hemorrhage, before the introduction of the practice of tying arteries by the celebrated Pare in the fore part of the sixteenth century, were of the most rude and cruel kind, such as the actual cautery with red-hot iron, and the appli- cation of boiling pitch to the bleeding surface. It is certain that this great and good man could have had no idea of the circulation

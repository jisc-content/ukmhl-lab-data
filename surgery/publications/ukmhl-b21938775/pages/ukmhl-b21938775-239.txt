THE EXCISION OF JOINTS FOR TRAUMATIC CAUSE. Although excisions have been practised upon all the articulations of both extremities, for traumatic lesions which would otherwise demand amputation, satisfactory experience of their results, except in the shoulder and elbow, is, at present, either wanting, or of a very limited character. To appreciate their exact value for each individual joint is, consequently, hardly practicable. More than this, the pecu- liarities of these operations, and the conditions which justify their adoption, are such, that, in the varying fortunes of a campaign, the character of the injuries inflicted, the state of surgical resources, or other circumstances, may even require them to be abandoned altogether. The propriety of their performance, also, obviously varies with the limb implicated. An excision in the lower extremity, which is designed to sup- port the weight of the body and is the chief agent in locomo- tion, is evidently a different thing from one in the upper extremity, which, with gentler movements to execute, has no weight to sustain, acts independently of its fellow, permits ex- ercise and locomotion during the processes of cure, and which may be shortened, deprived of certain uses, and limited in others, yet still remain of the greatest service. The contrast is made still more apparent when we remember the admir/ible substitutes for the lower extremity which mechanical inge- nuity has furnished, whilst the most imperfect and partial movements of the hand surpass in usefulness those of the best artificial contrivances which have yet been invented.

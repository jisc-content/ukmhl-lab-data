28 expected,) there would not be mucli probability of this disease making its appearance among our soldiers. Con- gress did a wise act in adding potatoes to the ration. Treatment of scurvy.â€”Scarcely anything remains to be said under this head. The general treatment is that which we have indicated as best adapted to prevent the occur- rence of scurvy. The special treatment must be directed to such prominent symptoms as particularly claim attention. The measures to be adopted are, however, at most merely adjuvants to those physical, moral, and dietetic means which we have already insisted upon, and which will of themselves eventually relieve any local manifestations of the disease. Swollen and spongy gums may, however, be washed with a solution of tannin or a dilute solution of per- sulphate of iron. Ulcers are to be treated according to the general principles applicable ; Aveak astringent or gently stimulating applications being generally the best. Stilf joints are to be rubbed with a stimulating liniment and subjected frequently to passive motion. Should false anchylosis have occurred, the limb is to be forcibly ex- tended and fix^ by mechanical means. We have frequently succeeded in restoring' complete motion under such circum- stances by this measure. A tonic course of treatment has been recommended in scurvy. We scarcely think it frequently necessary. Iron. however, is always beneficial and deserves to rank high as a remedy for scurvy. We have had no experience with it as a prophylactic, but as an antidote to the scorbutic diathesis it is very valuable. We have usually preferred the tincture of the chloride in doses of thirty drops three times a day. The beneficial effect soon becomes well marked.

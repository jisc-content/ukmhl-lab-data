VENEREAL DISEASES. 9 14. Gonorrlioeal oplitlialiiiia requires tlic sti-ictest attention to cleanliness, the frequent use of an astringent collyrium, free- dom of the bowels, and, in most eases, tonics or stimulants. The eyes should be bathed every fifteen niiiuites with a solution of a drachm of alum to a pint of tejjid water, or a decoction of poppy heads. The surgeon, at his daily visit, after thoi'oughly cleansing the mucous membrane of its purulent secretion and the adherent masses of coagulum, should snip the chemoscd portions of the ocular conjunctiva with scissors, and, after the the bleeding has ceased, pencil the whole affected surface either with the solid crayon of nitrate of silver, or with a strong so- lution of the same salt (3jâ€”5j ad aqujB 3 j), washing off the residue with tepid water, as soon as the surtace has become whitened. In addition, a solution of five grains of nitrate of silver to the ounce of water, may be dropped in the eye three or four times a day b_y the attendant. An active purge at the outset of treatment is desirable, and a daily evacuation of the bowels should be secured. The ffreat danger to vision is from ulceration and slou2;h of the cornea, a tissue of low vitality, and a disastrous termination of the disease is favored by a low condition of the general sys- tem ; hence all depressing agents, as venesection, mercurials, tartarized antimony, abstinence from food, etc., are to be avoided, and a nourishing diet, porter, ale, quinine, and other tonics, to be enjoined. If ulceration of the cornea occui's, its progress may perhaj)s be arrested by lightly touching the surface with a pointed crayon of nitrate of silver; and the pupil should be kept coiistautly dihited with atropine or belladonna. Poultices of every kind are to be strictly prohibited, and the eye left un- covered. Tlie discharge is highly contagious, and the utmost caution should be used to prevent its coming in contact with a sound eye.

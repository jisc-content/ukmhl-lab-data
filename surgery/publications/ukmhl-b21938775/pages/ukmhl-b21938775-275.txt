17 CoMPLTOATloNR.—TIic inost important goncral diseases wliicti icomplicii te dysentery, especially in its epidemic form, arc iypkm uml lyplinid fever, intermittent fever, and seiirv}/. In refei-encc to the two forms cf fever first mcnlioucd, little need he added to what lias already been said, except that they moru or less obscure the dysenteric symptoms during tlicir ■conliiiimiico; hut if the patient survives their decline, those 8ym|)loms rca|)]icar, and by their peculiar gravity rapidly ex- Iiaust the powers of life. ]ii cases of dysentery, to which one of the olher diseases has been suiioradded, the intestinal Icsioiip do not n|ipoar to have their i)rogrcs3 suspended, although the diarrlioja may have ceased or become very slight as well as the ten(\smus. Afler life has been rapidly extinguished, with ex- haustion l)y fref|ucnt, tliin, wateiy, serous, sanious, or bloody stools of an excessively fetid character, and the other indica- tions of ii devitiilized blood and disintegrated solids, the mucou^t mendjrane of the large intestine is often extensively and deeply ulcei-aled, dai'k and even gangrenous, and sometimes there are found, besides, in the small intestine the characteristic lesions of ty|)hoid fever. l>ut, we repeat it, the clinical history of such ■cases is often extremely obscure. Epidemics of dysentery in malarious districts are, in common with many other affections wit,li a local lesion, more or lesp inflncnced by tlic cause periodical fevers. Not only do these predispose to attacks of the former disease, but it Avould seem that tlie predis[)Osing causes of the one, such as cold, dampness and IVdigne tend to develop the otiier. Not unfrcquently an attack of dysentery suspends the interiiuttent paroxysms, which rcfiii'n upon its decline. In some cases the two affections occur 8imnltnn(!ously, and the dysenteric sym])toms present |)eriodical exacerbations ; in others the i)hcnomena of the paroxysms of intermittent fevers arc dysenteric, the intermission being free 2

(3) ON THE TREATMENT OP FRACTURES IN MILITARY SURGERY. In military practice, peculiar diflSculties ai'e apt to exist in the treat- ment of fractures; so that the surgeon is sometimes obliged to amputate limbs which he might in civil life hope to save. These difSculties arise either from the want of suitable or adequate apparatus, or from the un- favorable conditions of the case; as on the field of battle, on the march, or wherever the patient must be transported any distance before finding the rest and quiet so essential to his comfort or even safety. It has there- fore been thought by the Sanitary Commission that some hints upon this branch of surgery, and especially upon the expedients which may be resorted to in emergencies, might prove useful to those engaged in the army medical service. MATERIALS FOR SPLINTS, ETC. A supply of heavy pasteboard, or binder's board, will be found of great value for making splints. It may be cut into strips eighteen inches long and six wide; there should also be a dozen or more pieces of twice this width, for making angular arm-splints. Paper of any kind, but the stouter the better, folded to give it sufficient firmness, may be substituted in many cases, when pasteboard cannot be had. Wide straps of thick leather, or even strips of the bark of certain trees, will often answer. The pasteboard, first softened in hot water, is moulded to the injured part, and confined in its place by means either of bandages or of adhesive plaster. Cold water will soften it, but not so well as hot; it may be bent without either, but is not then very manageable, and moreover is apt to break.

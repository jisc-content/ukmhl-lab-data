PNEUMONIA. Of the diseases which the Army Surgeon must expect to encounter in the present nnhappy contest, pnenmonia is one of the most important. This disease lias already prevailed to a considerable extent among the troops on the Potomac and in the West; but it will, doubtless, prevail to a much greater ex- tent during the months of winter and spring. It prevails ha- bitually much more among the inhabitants of the Middle and Southern States than at the North. It will be more likely to occur among jSTorthern soldiers in a Southern climate than among native or acclimated residents. Statistics show that it occurs much oftener among those who are exposed to the vicis- situdes of the weather, than among those whose occupations involvc confinement within doors; hence, it may be expected to prevail especially among ti'oops in active service. Not only the prevalence, but the gravity of this disease is greater in the Middle and Southern than in the Northern States. A larger ratio of deaths in the former than in the latter is to be expected. In sections in which the periodical fevers are rife, pneumonia is apt to be extremely fatal. This is the uniform testimony of physicians practising in malarious regions, especially at the South. These considerations show sufficiently the importance of the subject of pneumonia, at this time, to the Army Surgeon. But others may be added. Not only has pneumonia been studied, within the last few years, with diligence and success, as regards its morbid anatomy, symptomatic phenomena, ])athological character and laws, but perhaps on no ntlicr ini])oi-timt inflam- matorv affection has clinical observation been broui^ht to bear So fully and efficiently as regards the management.

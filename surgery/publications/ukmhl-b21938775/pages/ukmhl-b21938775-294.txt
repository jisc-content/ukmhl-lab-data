the treatment of tJrCsc affections, and in the nnmerou!? reports whicli we liave consulted, almost every medicine 'Mf mentioned either with disrespect, or in terms of very sparing commenda- tion : but of tliose which are most favorably alluded to—opiunti and the combination of gray powder [mercury with chalk,] ipe- cacuanha, the mineral acids, and tlie preparations of iron seem to have enjoyed the greatest degree of conGdence ; charcoal also was administered in some regiments, alone and in combi- nation with camplior, with apparent advantage, and quinine was early resorted to on accouut of the periodic nature of these affections in some instances • but no decided testimony to its usefulness can be procured, and it was more often pre- scribed only in the convalescent stages.

Upon this point, however, it is obvious that every observer will have formed his own opinion, and we shall, therefore, only further

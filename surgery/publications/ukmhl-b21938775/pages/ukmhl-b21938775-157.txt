The indwidual operation should he determined l>y the Serviceahleness of the Stuvip.â€”This question iuvolvcfi, accord- ing to previous rules in determining the puint of election in amputations, the social condition of the patient. The poor man's and the rich man's leg have long decided the point of amputation of the lower extremity. This distinction is made in the belief that the poor nuui will either have no artificial appliance to his stump, or one of the rudest character, while the I'ich man will avail himself of the hi<2;hest decree of art to compensate his loss.

The instances are becomino; more and more frequent where persons in humble circumstances, who have had a limb removed according to this rule, have subsequently been able to supply themselves with artificial aids, and have bitterly regretted that they have been deprived of the opportunity by the surgeon. It cannot be denied that in such cases the rule has operated to the serious disadvantage of the patient.

The two following questions grow out of this conclusion :

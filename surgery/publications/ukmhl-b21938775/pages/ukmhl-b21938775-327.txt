We believe that to this action, and the thorough means he took to pro- vide for ventilation, are in the main to be ascribed the freedom of his party from scurvy. Immoderate bodily exertion, Avhen required on the part of the soldiers by military necessit}^, must, of course, be sub- mitted to. But there are times when it can be avoided.

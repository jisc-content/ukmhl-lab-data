17 the same. In New Mexico, soldiers were often packed at night in two or three tiers of beds, with two in a bed. There can be no doubt as to the state of the atmosphere by morning, and its influence in causing scurvy was well marked. It often happens that the physical conditions we have mentioned occur together. Dr. Opitz,* in an excellent mono- graph, shows that cold, humidity, and bad air Avere the chief if not the only causes of the epidemic of scurvy which attacked the Austrian garrison at Ranstatt in 1852. Out of 4,300 men, 610 had scurvy. The unfavorable state of the atmosphere, moisture combined with cold, and the oppres- sive and miasmatic character of the air in the over-crowded locality of the barracks, are the causes to which Opitz mainly ascribes the epidemic. Insufficient exercise on the one hand and excessive physical exertion on the other, are among the exciting causes of scurvy. The influence of the former has been perceived among the arctic explorers, and the over-worked soldiers of the allied army afforded marked examples of the power of the latter cause. The moral causes of scurvy, though perhaps not so apparent in their influence as those we have mentioned, are, never- theless, of very considerable importance. Nostalgia is a common exciting cause of scurvy. To this, and the despondency of mind which attends it, the attacks of scurvy which have proved so fatal to arctic adventurers owe much of their violence. So well is mentcd depression recog- nised as a cause of the disease in question, that arctic navi- gators have taken every means in their power to guard against it.

7 from the same practice after gun-shot wounds received in hattle. But the fact cannot be concealed, that excisions, hardly excepting even those of the head of the humerus and of the elbow, are operations not likely to succeed in the hos- pitals of an army under any circumstances. The unfavora- ble hygienic conditions which must prevail amongst large numbers of wounded men congregated together, will often decide the fate of the soldier whose limb a mistaken kind- ness may hava. tempted his surgeon into the endeavor to preserve. To incline towards the side of conservatism in cases permitting of doubt, will be to see patients die" whose lives amputation might have saved. It was for these reasons, that the practice of conservative surgery was so very limited in the recent Italian campaign, and in the lower extremity almost abandoned. They cannot but weigh with equal force in that in which the United States Army is now engaged. So much being premised, the most important points con- nected with the various excisions will now be passed rapidly in review, HEAD OF THE HUMERUS. The advanced position of the soldier's shoulder when in the act of firing makes it an event of not infrequent occurrence for a bullet either to bury itself in the head of the humerus, or to traverse it without much comminution, or, striking im- mediately below it, to break the bone short off at its neck. Heavier projectiles also and fragments of shell sometimes lay open and fracture the joint, and carry away, perhaps, a por- tion of the deltoid muscle. In these or other injuries of the shoulder-joint, unaccompanied by damage to the large vessels and nerves, and when the bone is not too much splintered or comminuted in the shaft, the judgment of the surgeon must determine the propriety of an attempt to save the limb. Ex- tensive fissures do not absolutely interdict excision, and whilst decapitation of the humerus is ordinarily alone required, four

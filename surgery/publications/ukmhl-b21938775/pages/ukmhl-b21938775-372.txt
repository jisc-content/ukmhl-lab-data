22 Singular relief is often given to violent pain in the head by this means. It may almost be compared to the effects of an anassthetic inhalation, in many instances. Dry cupping to the nucha and temples is serviceable. For the urgent thirst of an exacerbation, nothing is so grate- ful and so advantageous as the effervescing draught of the U. S. Pharmacopoeia. This not only diminishes the desire for drinks, but is, perhaps, the most efficient diaphoretic we possess. It is infinitely preferable to the common and distasteful spirits of Mindererus. When the stomach is tranquil, small quanti- ties (a thirty-second part of a grain) of tartar emetic every two hours are beneficial. This is always attainable, is tasteless, and is prepared by putting a grain of the salt to a pint of water; dose, one tablespoonful. It is well understood that cold water or ice are to be allowed in small quantities and at frequent intervals. For the gastric irritability, when severe, we may prescribe acetate of lead, one grain every hour or two, in solution ; hydrocyanic acid ; creasote; chloroform ; lime water; epigastric blistering and eudermic use of morphia; cold mint julep; opiates by the mouth, or by the hypodermic syringe. Occa- sionally a mustard plaster applied to the spine will prove efficacious. During the exacerbations, the patient will not need more nourishment than is contained in barley, rice, or gum arabic water. Tea and coffee, taken cold, are often most grateful as well as useful, from their stimulant qualities. As soon as the appetite demands and the stomach will tolerate them, it is well to administer nourishing animal broths. Frequently, cold milk and lime water will prove all-sufficient for diet, and will be retained, whilst other food is rejected or causes epigastric distress. In those instances in which, after eight or ten da3's, the dis- ease proves intractable, and shows a tendency to pass into a form resembling typhus or typhoid fever, the treatment should

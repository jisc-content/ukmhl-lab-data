21 " power of fibrillation lost," " color dirty brown," " corpuscles altered and misshapen, with no tendency to form rouleaux, and with adherent granules," " great rapidity of decomposition," " no separation occurring in the coagulum." Finally, Doctor Blair concludes that the healthy condition of the blood depends upon the free action of the kidneys, a copious black vomit, and alkaline exhalations of the breath. The Irain shows no special pathological condition in its structure. Congestion, with occasional ecchymotic apoplectic extravasions are not very uncommon. The stomach, sometimes natural in appearance, has more fre- quently its mucous membrane discolored, mammelonated, thickened, and softened, with patches of ecchymosis; ulceration is very rare. Its contents vary, according to circumstances. In many cases there are analogous lesions of the mucous membrane of the intestines. These latter frequently contain the matter of black vomit, as is so often the case with the stomach itself. The i3esophageal mucous membrane, as a rule, is found altered, especially by softening and by discoloration, and by loss of epitheliumâ€”the latter condition being pi'obably due to the acrid matters vomited. The liveryin fatal cases of yellow fever, as a rule, is in a state of acute fatty degeneration. This was first conclusively shown by Doctor Alonzo Clark, in 1852. It is usual to say that it has the color of cafe au lait, that it is dry, not of necessity altered in size, and that it contains little or no bile. Some observations have spoken of large, dark colored livers, yielding abundance of blood, on section. These are exceptional, as Clark well states, in one case, hypersemia produces much htematoidin, and a moderate amount of oil ; in the other, much oil and little boamatoidin. The gall Uadder may be empty or full. The cases are very exceptional in which normal bile is found in it. Light colored mucus and blood have been met with.

18 We are convinced that many cases of scurvy occurring among ovei'land emigrants to Oregon and California are due to despondency and anxiety. During periods of weary in- action, or the depression of mind produced by disaster and defeat, scurvy has always been more persistent and violent in armies and fleets. Dietetic causes.â€”Undoubtedly the most efficient agents in the causation of scurvy are those arising from the long-con- tinued use of food deficient in these substances which the organism requires for its perfect nutrition, or else of too unvarying a character. For a long time it was supposed that scurvy was due to the continued ingestion of salt meat. It is doubtful, how- ever, that such is the case. It is not so much the use of salt food as it is the deprivation of succulent vegetable food, which induces scurvy. Dr. Hayes has, however, recentlv informed the writer that he thinks the immunity of his com- mand from scurvy was, in great part, due to the fact that the men had such an abundance of fresh reindeer meat that they did not have to resort at all to the salt provisions. There are, nevertheless, many examples on record of scurvy appearing when fresh meat has formed the staple article of diet, and we have ourselves witnessed many cases of the disease among troops who had fresh meat four days out of the seven as a part of their ration, and who had it the other three from game which they procured for themselves.

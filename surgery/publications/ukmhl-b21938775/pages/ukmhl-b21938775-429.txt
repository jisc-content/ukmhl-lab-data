The attention of the Sanitary Commission has been directed to the fact, that most of our Army Surgeons, now in the field, are unavoid- ably deprived of many facilities they have heretofore enjoyed for the consultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place within their reach anything that can be termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution among the medical staff, of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying in a condensed form the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions which are likely to present themselves to surgeons in the field, on the largest scale, and whicK are, therefore, of chief practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing papers on several subjects of this nature, to certain of its associate members, in our principal cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names are the best evidence of their fitness for their duty. The following paper comprising '■'■Hints for the Control and Pre- ■vention of Infectious Diseases in Camps, Transports, and Hospitals,''^ prepared by a member of the Commission, belongs to this series, and is respectfully recommended by the Commission to the Army. J. FOSTER JENKINS, M. D., Secretary. New York, October, 1863.

33 patient fasting'. This dose, prepared from tlic same portion of ipecacuanha, was repeated for two or three consecutive days. We are assured that it strengthened rather tlian debilitated. 'Quite recentl}' we learn that the remedy is still regarded as a spccilic in Peru, and that it should be prescribed in tlie follow- ing manner. From lialf a drachm to a drachm of powdered ipecacuanha, mixed witli a little syrup and water, is given early in the morning, and the patient is directed to lie quietly and to avoid drinking anything to excite vomiting. Night and raorn- iug an enema is administered of the infusion of bruised ipecac- uanha in twenty-four ounces of water to which one ounce of "syrup of morphia" is added. The powder and the enema are thus employed for three or four successive days. Little vomit- ing is produced, but the second or third dose causes copious bil- ious stools, which is the proposed effect of the medicine.

If the case is too urgent to admit of the delay necessary for tiic systematic plan here indicated, it is advised to administer ten grains of powdered ipecacuanha and one grain of opium every six or eight hours, and the enema above described, night and morning, until the urgent symptoms are arrested.

Instead of seeking either the emetic or the specific operation of ipecacuanha alone, we may obtain its peculiar benefits through tiic cmcto-cathartic cflcct of ipecacuanha and calomel together, by administering twenty grains of the former with ten or (ifteen grains of the latter. On tiic next day the saliye Bolutions already recommended, and on the following day the calomel alone may be repeated, or if the gastric disturbance still Ibi-ms a prominent symptom, the ipecacuanha also.

(3) ON HEMOERHAGE FROM WOUNDS, AND THE BEST MEANS OF ARRESTING IT. Ter sese attollens cubitoquc nnnixa levavit, Tor revoluta toro est occuHsque crrantibus alto Qiiasivit Ccelem lucem ingemuitque repcrta. Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping liead, And fainting thi-ice fell groveling on the bed.â€”Dryden. This beautiful description of the death of the Tjrean queen by hemorrhage is as true to nature, to-day, as it was two thousand years ago. The successive periods of syncope and of recovery, are so admirably depicted that we almost wonder why the ancients, though they knew nothing of the circulation of the blood, did not proceed a single step, and discover that the paroxysms of faint- ing were immediately due to the sese attollens^'' the erect posture, and the consequent deiicient supply of blood to the brain. And yet, simple and true as this law of nature ever has been and still is, I fear that thousands of poor soldiers in our armies are annually losing their lives from its violation, through the mis- taken kindness of their friends. When a wounded soldier faints, his companions are too apt to leave the ranks and place him in the sitting position, sprinkle him with water, and endeavor by all the means in their power to excite him to consciousness. In this way syncope that might be only temporary, is many times rendered permanent and fatal; for the formation of a clot in the wound, which is the man's only hope of stopping the flow of blood, is thus prevented, and the hemorrhage increased through acceleration of the circula- tion. If he were allowed to remain in the recumbent position, the coagulum which nature provides would prove an obstacle to the further loss of blood. Were a little useful knowledge of this

The attention of the Sanitary Commission has been directed to the fact, that most of our Array Surgeons, now in the field, are unavoid- bly deprived of many facilities they have heretofore enjoyed for the consultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place within their reach anylhing that can be termed a medical library. ThÂ« only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution among the medical staif, of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying in a condensed form the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions which are likely to present themselves to surgeons in the Geld, on the largest scale, and which arc, therefore, of chief practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing papers on several subjects of this nature, to certain of its associate members, in our principal cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names are the best evidence of their fitness for their duty. The following paper on " The Nature and Treatment of Yellow Fever," belongs to this series, and is respectfully recommended by the Commission to the medical officers of our army now in the field.

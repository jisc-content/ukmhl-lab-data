Tiiese various degrees and kinds of admixture cause tlie color of the discharges to vary from pale to almost black. There is a peculiar tendency, also, to gaseous disten- sion of tlie bowels, and the evacuated matters are extremely fetid, exhaling a putrid or cadaverous smell. Tliis circum- stance may be owing in part to the large quantity of altered blood which the bowels contain. The stools are very frequent, and may amount to one or two hundred in twenty-four hours, while thirty or forty are passed, even in the mildest cases. As might be expected from tins circumstance tenesmus is sometimes constant and very distressing, and the urine scalds in passing. But ncitlier of these symptoms is so frequent or severe as in the purely inflammatory form of dysentery. Intense thirst may be noticed as a prominent symptom. In the worst cases, the tormina and tenesmus are constant, even in the short intervals between the evacuations, and eveu when the latter are abun- dant ; but cessation of pain,- excessive raeteorism, and hiccup, are among the worst signs, to which may be added paralysis of the lower extremities, of the mouth, tongue, or organs of deg- lutition. The duration of bilious dysentery is less than tliat of the inflammatory form, a favorable termination frequently occurring within a week, in mild cases, and within a fortnight in the more severe. On the other liand, it may terminate fatally at a period as early as the shorter, or as late as the longer jieriod. or even later, if an improper plan of treatment has been pur- sued in cases wliich tend naturally to a cure.

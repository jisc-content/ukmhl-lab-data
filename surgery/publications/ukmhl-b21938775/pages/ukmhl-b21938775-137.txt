The attention of the Sanitary Commission has been directed to the fact, that most of our Array Surgeons, now in the field, are unavoidably deprived of many facilities they have heretofore enjoyed for the consultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place within their reach anything that can be termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution among the medical staff, of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying, in a condensed form, the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions which are likely to present them- selves to surgeons in the field, on the largest scale, and which arc, therefore, of chief practical imi^ortnnco. The Commission lias assigned the duty of preparing papers on several subjects of this nature, to certain of its associate members, in our principal cities, belonging to the medical jirofession, Avhose names are the best evidence of their fitness for their duty. The following paper on " Amputations through the Foot and at the Ankle-Joint," belongs to this series, and is respectfully recom- mended by the Commission to the medical oflicers of our army now in the field.

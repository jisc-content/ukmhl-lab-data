30 Vaccination in armies. axillaiT glands, and in some cases on the fourth or fifth day by considerable febi'ile disturbance.'' METHOD OF PRESERVING VACCINE LYMPH. By Dr. Hdsbaito, of Edinburgh.* The following method of preserving lymph in capillary glass tubes has been found entirely successful. Lymph has been used, after being kept for several years, with satisfactory re- sults. The tube employed is simple, straight, cylindrical, open at both ei:ds, and of such dimensions as to fulfil the folloM ing conditions, upon which it will be found that its peculiar value, as a means for preserving lymph for future every-day use, es- sentially depends. It must beâ€” 1. In the first place, of such tenuity that it can be sealed in- stantaneously at the flame of a candle. 2. In the second place, large enough to contain as much lymph as is sufficient for one vaccination. 3. In the third place, long enough to admit of both ends being sealed hermetically without subjecting the charge to the heat of the flame. 4. And, in the fourth place, of such strength as not to break easily in the mere handling. The following is the mean of several measurements which I have made of tubes, difl'ering somewhat in size, but all of them capable of containing a suflicient charge of lymph, and of be- ing sealed instantaneously at the flame of a candle, without subjecting the contained charge to the heat, and also strong enough to bear all necessary manipulations without breaking: Average length 2;f to 3 inches. Diameter of an inch. Thickness of wall ^Jg of an inch. Calibre. * Second Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, 1859. (Blue Book), London.

8 MILITARY HYGIKNE AND THERAPEUTIC?. ill September, 1855, after 31G days of hard work and figlitiiig in the trendies. A million of sand-bags and 80,000 gabions had been eni])lo_yed. There had been 600,000 diseharges of cannon and mortars. Twenty leagnes of trenches had l)een opened. After the taking of the Malakoff, the French sur- geons had the care of 5,000 wounded joersons, including many of the Russians. The whole number of patients under treat- ment at that time in the French ambulances was 10,520. In one division, three surgeons and one apothecary liad the entire care of 900 patients.

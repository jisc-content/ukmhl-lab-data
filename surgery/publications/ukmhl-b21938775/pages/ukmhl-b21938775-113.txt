VACCINATION IN ARMIES. 27 This coininnnicatioii has shown, we trust, 1st : That iii iiiiai'j vaccinatidii is a positive protection, witliiii certain limits, against smallpox. 2d. That tliere is a period of life when lliat iiifiiience declines, and that the history of ejjidemics teaches tliat smallpox will attack a variable proporlion of the vacci- nated if exposed to its influence. 3d. That the mere 2^o.ssih/.l- ^^yof su(;h a decline renders I'eprotection necessary. 4th. That in revaccination we have an almost infalliltle I'cstorer of that protection and preventive of the spread of variolous epidemics. Hence, that revaccination in all bodies exposed to variolous contagion is imperativelij demanded. 5th. That the operations of vaccination and revaccination are unattended with danger to those subjected to them. The committee would therefore earnestly i-ecomniend that the Sanitary Commission make such representation to the proper authorities as will secure the re- vaccination of all soldiers who cannot prove its performance upon them within the previous five years, and that arrange- ments be made by which good vaccine virus may be distributed by their agents to the medical officers.

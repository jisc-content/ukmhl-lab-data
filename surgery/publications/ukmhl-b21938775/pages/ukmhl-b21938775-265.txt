7 abdominal pain (tormina,) a constant and urgent dcnirc to go to stool (tenesmus,) and scanty mucous and bloody discharges. No- sologically, or according to its nature as a disease, it is a peculiar poisoning of tlic blood manifested by fever, and nervous dis- ()i-(ler or depression, and a follicular inflammation of the large intestine. Of this last proposition a sufficient proof is tiic total want uf proportion lictween the local lesions and the constitu- tional syuiptoms. The latter not only precede the former, l)ut may even prove fatal before the lesion of the intestine has developed itself. According to this view, which is suggested especially by the epidemic form of the disease, dysentery is analogous to typhoid fever rather than to the intestinal irrita- tion produced by acrid substances, and by piles, lislula, and similar local affections of the rectum ; for as in typhoid fever of a grave type the general phenomena predominate, and death itself mny occur before any ulceration of Peyer's glands takes pkice, so in dysentery a fatal issue may be quite independent <if intestinal changes, but present, on the otlier hand, all the evidences of blood poisoning. But while we must recognize in dysenttry a specific nature demonstrated by the uniform occurrence of a cliaractcristic lesion, whenever time is given fur this to form, we must admit that the whole symptomatic livery, or ty[)C of the disease is under the control of external circumstances ; that under particular conditions it presents typhoid symptoms ; in others bilious : in others, again, period- ical phenomena, all of which amy be superadded to or modify the essential characters of simple dysentery. It results from these facts that the essential jihenomena of dysentery may l)ecome of far less importance than tiiose which its accidental typo impress upon it; that the latter may determine its degree of gravity, and even indicate a treatment directed not so much against the intestinal symptoms and presumed lesions, as against the diathesis, or constitutional state which overlies them.

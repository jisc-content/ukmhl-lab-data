19 In mild cases, conyalescence may be established as early as the third day. Some epidemics have been characterized by speedy and uninterrupted return to health, others by a slow and lingering process, extending to several weeks, even where the type of fever was benign. Although tlie symptoms subside on the fourth day, the patient is stripped of all his strength, and can neither sit tip nor take exercise for five or six days. * Generally speaking, relapses are not to be dreaded, although some observers, in particular years and places, have mentioned them as being frequent. Recovery may be expected to occur without sequela? of serious nature. Incubation may be said to have for its usual period about a week. It has been known to extend to twice that time. As to mortality in yellow fever, the usual law of grave epi- demic is observed. The largest proportion of fatal cases occur early in the visitation. Some years will be noted by the com- parative rarity of deaths, others by sweeping devastation. " In Mobile (1819) out of a population of one thousand souls, more than one half of whom were acclimated, four hundred and thirty died!" (Lewis.) After what has already been said, it will be useless to the practitioner to allude further to prognisis in general. Nor need the matter of differential diagnosis claim our further care. In mild cases, occurring in regions where bilious remittent fever prevails, there will always be a likelihood of mistake, for a short time and among the early patientsâ€”but this source of error cannot long exist in epidemics. " An initiatory chill, of moderate duration and severity, immediately followed by intense pain in the head, back, and limbs ; redness and suffu- sion of the eyes ; moderate excitement of tlic circulation, and moderate heat of surface; anorexia ; tliirst; white tongue, with red tip and edges ; these febrile symptoms of the first

HINTS FOR AFTER-TREAT^>IENT. 1. When a wound is extensive, as in cases of ami)ntation, it is far pi-eferable to leave the wound open, witli a piece of wet lint, or a thin cunipress, interposed between tlie lips, fur two or three hours, until the surface has become glazed, in this way, as reaction conies on, hemorrhage may be often avoided, or if it does occur, is easily controlled without the distui-bance of the dress iiiics. Tliei'e need be no feai' as regai'ds the nundjcrof the ligatures applied. It is better to employ too many than too few, at the time of operation. 2. The dressings of a stumj) should be as simple and as little cumbersome as the case will in any way admit of. A narrow strip of water-dressing should be laid along the edge of the incision, over the strips of adhesive plaster, and the part should be so arranged that one end (^f the incision may be most de- pendent, in order to facilitate the escape of all dischai'ges. An outlet for this jjurpose should never be neglected. 3. The jiosition of the stump is (^f the utmost iini)ortance. By proper attention to this point, the edges and surfaces of the incision luay be brought into contact, and the patient is sj)ared the pain and uneasiness which, under other circumstances, the tension and pressure, necessary to bring the pai'ts togethei', uiu^t invariably ])roduce. â– f. If the dressings are ])ropcrly aitplied, as a general rule, these need not be changed for several days after amputation. Nriich mischief is undoubtedly done by a too hasty removal of the fii'st dressing-s. 5.

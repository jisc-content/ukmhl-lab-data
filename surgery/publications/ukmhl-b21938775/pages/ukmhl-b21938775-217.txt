1 TYPHOID FEVEE. Diagnosis.—From tlie severer kinds of fever, generally by the mildness of its accession and symptoms; great caution is liowever to be observed here. From the phlegmasia, by the absence of any discoverable local affection. Tkeatment.—In ordinary cases very simple. If great vas- cular excitement or signs of active cerebral congestion exist, venesection to the extent of from eight to sixteen ounces may be resorted to in a strong man ; but tliis is seldom necessary. Generally an efficient cathartic at the outset, followed by refrigerant diaplioretics, witb proper attention to regimen, is all that is required. In the choice of a cathartic, be guided by circumstances. If febrile excitement is intense, sulphate of magnesia alone, or with inf. sennic; if symptoms of acidity be present, the pure magnesia may be added ; for hepatic con- gestion and deficieni; hepatic secretion, give two or three comp. cath. pills. Eight or ten grains of Dovers powder at night, Avill generally be of service. If the fever lasts beyond a day or two, the bowels must be kept regularly open by saline ca- thartics, with the diaphoretics above named in the intervals. All excitements are to be avoided, rest and strictly farinaceous diet enjoined ; cold water and simple acidulated drinks, but no stimnlants allowed. Should inflammation in any organ be de- veloped, the case is to be treated exactly as an ordinary phleg- masia of that oi'o'an. ;— : 11. TYPHOID FEVER, (Syn.) Com. Continued Fever, Enteric Fever, Abdominal Typhus, Dolhin Enteritis. . Tliis is the ordinary endemic fever of jSTew England, and of those portions of the United States in whicli the miasmatic or bilious fevers do not prevail. The official army I'eports show it to be more or less inino-led with the latter also witliin their own es])ecial limits, and rarely to be entirely absent, indeed, in any part of our country'.

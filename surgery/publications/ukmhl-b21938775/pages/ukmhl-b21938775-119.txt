VACCINATION IN ARMIES. * Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, 1858. 83 to prevent motion. Another piece of wood of the same size, but which need not be quire so thick, is then laid above the groove and its contents, and the two pieces are joined in any way that is thought most convenient, by being tied or pinned together. NEW MODE OF PRESERVING VIKUS. By Dr. Collins.* Having experienced much trouble, particularly of late, in keeping a reliable supply of vaccine virus for public vaccina- tions, I was glad to meet with any suggestions which would aid me in accomplishing this very desirable object. I immedi- ately made some experiments, which have convinced me that, by the use of glycerine, we can probably preserve vaccine virus for a great lengtli of time, and that when we desire it for more immediate use, this liquid is by far the best solvent for the solid matter that we possess. It saves us both time and trouble, and enables us to use the matter with much greater economy, which is of importance when our stock happens to be small. I think that no one who has once used glj'cerine for this pur- pose would desire to use any thing else. In my tirst experiment, I pulverized about one-eighth of an ordinary scab upon a glass plate, and moistened it with a small drop of glycerine. It is better that the matter be pulverized, as it otherwise dissolves very slowly. The quantity thus pre- pared served fur my vaccinations for several days, amount- ing in all to twenty-four, among which tliere were about two failuresâ€”a success whicli I have rarely attained when using water as the solvent. There was. of course, no drying up of the matter, after the solution, requiring renewed applica- tions of the solvent, and so long as any remained upon the plate it was ready for immediate use. I next pulverized another one-eighth of a scab, and dissolved It in about two drops of glycerine, placed at the bottom of a very small phial. From this I lilled, by suction with the month,

AMPUTATIONS. 7 1. Amputate with as little delay as possible, after the receipt of the injury, in those eases where there is intense suffering from the ]n-esence in the wound of spienla of bone, or otlier foreign bodies, which the fingers or forceps cannot reach. 2. In those cases where a limb is nearly torn otf, and a dan- gerous hemorrhage is occurring, which cannot be arrested. 3. In those eases where it is clearly seen that the patient is not suffering from immediate collapse, or great nervous depres- sion, a condition which will probably come on if there is any considerable delay. If the shock or collapse is extreme, the operation must be postponed, until, by appropriate measures, reaction is sufficiently established. 4. In certain cases, where the collapse is not extreme, the use of Sulphuric Ether, as an anaesthetic agent, often has the effect of bringing about a moderate reaction. Such cases 'would formerly have required delay. 5. In army-practice, attempts to save a limb which might be perfectly successful in civil life, cannot be made. Especially is this the case in compound gun shot fractures of the thigh, bullet wounds of the knee-joint, and similar injuries of the leg, in which, at first sight, amputation may not seem necessary. Under such circumstances, attempts to preserve a limb will be followed by extreme local and constitutional disturbance. Con- servative surgery is here an error; in oi'der to save life, the limb must be sacrificed Moreover, the suppuration and sloughing, attendant upon mutilated limbs, soon render tlie atmosphere of over-crowded hospitals or barracks perfectly untenantable; a fact entitled to a certain amount of weight, in cases where the propriety of primary amputation is at all questioned. THE POINT OF SELECTION. Modern surgery has abutidaiitly shown that, as a general rule, the risk is greater in [)n)])ortion as the size of the part which is amputated increases, and as the line of ami)utation

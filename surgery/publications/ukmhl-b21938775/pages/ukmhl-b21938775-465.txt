TiiK attention of tlio Snnitiiry Commission lins boon directed to (he fact., that most of our Arnij' Surgeons, now in tlie tiekl, are unavoid- ably dcin'lvcd of many facilities tbey have heretofore enjoyed for the con- sultation of standard medical authorities. It, is oljviously inipos,sil)le to place within their reach anything that can be termed a medical library. Tlie only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution among tlie medical staff, of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying in a condensed form the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical (|ucstions which are likely to present them- selves to surgeons in the field, on the largest scale, and which are, there- fore, of chief practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing papers on several subjects of this nature, to certain of its associate members, in our princi- pal cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names arc the best evidence of their fitness for their duty. The following paper, " On (lie Use of riastcr of Paris Splints in Military Surgery," prepared by Dr. James L. Little, late Ilousc-Surgeon of the New York Hospital, belongs to this series, and is respectfully recommended by the Commission to the Army. J. FOSTKR JENKINS, jM.

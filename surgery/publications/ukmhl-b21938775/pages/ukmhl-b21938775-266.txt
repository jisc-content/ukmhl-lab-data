8 For convenient study dysentery may be divided into Acute and Chronic, and the acute form into 31ild, Sthenic, Bilious, and Malignant. Of the Periodical variety a few words will also be said. Mild Acute Dysentery.â€”The earliest symptoms of this affec- tion are general malaise, soreness or pains in the back and limbs, debility, anorexia, and sometimes nausea and colic, and frequent calls to stool without any evacuation. But in other cases, diarrhoea, which is generally slight, may exist for several days before the more characteristic bowel complaint, and be itself not unfrequently preceded by constipation. The calls to stool become, however, more frequent and the discharges more scanty ; they are immediately preceded by borborygmi and colicky pains in the abdomen, and accompanied by a sense of weight in the perineum and anus, a painful straining or bearing down, and the passage of small quantities of fecal matter mixed with jelly-like mucus, tinged with blood, diffused or in streaks or small clots, and scalding the anus in its passage. Sometimes pure blood is discharged, particularly by persons subject to piles. The number of such stools varies from six or twelve to twenty-four every day. The abdomen is not usually tender, nor is the colic or the bearing down very severe. The heat of skin is moderate or scarcely perceptible ; the pulse slightly quickened; the tongue whitish, but moist; the appetite may be null, but is not always lost, and the thirst is moderate; but tormina and tenesmus are excited by all kinds of food except the very mildest. In this form an attack of dysentery is of one or two weeks' duration, and terminates by the gradual return of the alvine discharges to their feculent con- dition, and a copious later!tious dci)osit in tlic urine. Simulta- neously a full i>ei'spiraiion is sometimes observed as a critical phenomenon.

Attributing to drugs, what was simply a part of the natural history of the disease, the particular therapeutical course pursued by them has been heralded to the world as the true aud only one to be relied on. Is there a possibility of carrying au abortive treatment? Can yelloio fever he cut short 9 In the present condition of our knowledge, this question must be answered in the negative. Medical journals contain not a few contributions, announcing the discovery of ectrotic remedies; but there are two obvious sources of error, in their reasoning. The first has already been alluded to above. The second consists in the fact, that nearly all such observers have exercised their profession in localities subject to prevalence of bilious remittent fever. Certain it is, that subsequent experience on their own part, or on that of the general profession, has failed to confirm the value of the supjDOsed discovery, in any single instance. We are without a specific plan for the cure of this most grave malady. It is strictly, a self limited diseaseâ€”to be managed, to he led, but not to be driven, violently, towards a favorable issue. At the present day, no wise man places reliance on mercury, on the lancet, on cinchona, or on the muriatic tincture of iron as specific remedies.

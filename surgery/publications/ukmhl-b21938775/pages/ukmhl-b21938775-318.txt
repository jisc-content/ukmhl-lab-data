16 the restriction to this species of nutriment we have various other coexisting circumstances which have fully as much if not more power in giving rise to the scorbutic diathesis. The causes of scurvy may very properly be considered under three heads. The jj/i2/sicaZ, the moral, and the dietic. Physical causes.â€”Darhiess and cold are important agents in causing scurvy. Arctic voyagers have had abundant opportunity for noticing their influence. During the arctic winter it has been unifoi'mly the case that scurvy prevailed more extensively than during the summer, although there was no difference in the character of the food. Dr. I. 1. Hayes has informed the writer that there can be no doubt on this point. Of themselves, however, they are not suffi- cient, for during the recent voyage of this eminent traveller and discoverer, scurvy was entirely prevented by the excel- lent hygienic measures he adopted, and to which we shall soon have occasion to allude. Moisture is also a powerful cause of scurvy. This was very evident in the Crimea, where the men of the allied army were exposed in the trenches and even in their tents and huts to an excessive amount of moisture for a long period. Iminife air is another influential physical cause of scurvy. Dr. Hayes ascribes his immunity from scurvy chiefly to the excellent system of ventilation he adopted. In the United States Navy it has frequently been noticed that scurvy was much more violent in those ships in which little attention was given to renewing the atmosphere, than in those where good ventilation was insisted upon. We have several times had occasion to notice the appearance of this disease among troops crowded into small barracks, whilst those who had plenty of room escaped, though the other conditions were

APPENDIX Special Disinfectants and their Ajyj^lications.—That there can be no substitute for fresh air to meet the physiological requirements of respira- tion and health should be indelibly impressed upon every mind. Better that all substances at present employed as disinfectants and deodorants ■were at once prohibited by the Medical Department than that such agents should practically tend to be regarded as substitutes for a pure atmosphere. But the necessities and privations of army life, the multi- plied agencies of disease, and the vitiating conditions attendant upon wounds and sickness, create necessities for the employment of chemical and other artificial agencies to mitigate, and, in some measure, prevent the otherv^'ise inevitable contamination of the local atmosphere of crowded hospitals, transports, and quarters ; and it is only such necessary demands for the employment of disinfectants that justify even the occasional allusion we have made respecting them in preceding pages. They are simply aids in restoring and preserving healthful purity, and not substitutes for cleanliness and pure air. For the convenience of persons who may have occasion to refresh the memory with the more practical facts relating to special disinfectants, and the best method of their application, the following notes are added in reference to this subject: The principal disinfecting agents may be classified as follows: , , . .

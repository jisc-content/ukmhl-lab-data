MILITARY HYGIENE-AND THERAPEUTICS. 7 night march to fall snddcnlj upon the body of troops assem- bled around Babadagh, but at the moment when (at about 0 o'clock iu the evening) the oi-der for departure was given, 500 men lay stretched upon the earth unable to rise: the cholera had fallen like a thunder-bolt upon the expeditionary column. At 8 o'clock, there were already 15(Â» dead, and 350 dying." The pestilence continued its ravages, and the expedition to the Dobrudscha was consequently given up. The whole number of officers and men sent to the East by tlie French government, during the period of two years, was 309,268. Of this number 200,000 were under treatment at the ambulances and hospitals ; viz., 50,000 for wounds, and 150,000 for diseases. The medical officers of the French army ar- ranged their plans for taking care of their sick and w^ounded. on the basis of the calculation that 10 per cent, would be un- der treatment at one time. So, at the period when the number of their troops was limited to 40,000, tliey made provision for 4,000 to 5,000 patients. In the attacks of cholera during the Dobrudscha expedition the proportion of deaths to attacks was as 1 to l^V More than 8,000 French soldiers were placed hors du comhat by the cholera in the epidemic of Yarna and Dobrudscha. At the end of February of the first winter in the Crimea, there were 3,000 cases of scurvy in the French army, averaging 100 for each old regiment, and 25 for each new^ one. At the same period the wounds presented an un- healthy appearance, the granulations were flabby, traumatic gangrene was frequently observed. In the month of June, 1855, there were 4,000 cases of cholera, and more than six thousand wounds. The medical officers suffered greatly in health from their incessant and exhausting labors, about one- third of their number being sick. After the battle of Traktir Bridge, in August, 1S55, the French surgeons performed 300 amputations and resections. A number of them were obliged to walk a great distance to the field of action ; they were occu- pied with dressing wounds nearly the whole day, exposed to the heat of the sun, and tlien returned in tlie afternoon to the stationary ambulances, to ])erform urgent ()[)erations, wbich were not completed before midnight.

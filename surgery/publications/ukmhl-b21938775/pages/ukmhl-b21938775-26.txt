16 extended use of finjie.'=thetics in naval and military practice. I am satisfied tlint if, in their operations, tlie pain were more generally prevented many lives would be saved wliieh are now lost from the sliock to the nervous system, and tliat, in all severe cases, the prospect of recovery is better and the subsecpieiit iutlammatiou is milder wlieii an anaesthetic has been used. * To tkis conclusion T have not come hastily. Of so much import have I always regarded the prevention of the pain of ppei-ations, and so desirable, if it could be practically effected, that ten years before the introduction of ant^sthetic vapor I listened patiently and attentively to the claims of animal magnetism to this power to produce insensibility; but found, and I may say with unalloyed regret, that when fairly brought to the test, its most ardent friends were compelled to admit its utter inefficiency, and even since the inventii)n of anes- thetic inhalation, I have carefully tested the power of other agents, such as nitrous oxyde, to produce insensibility to pain, but still consider none of them deserving of mentioa when compared with chloroform or tether. In conclusion, perhaps I may say, that these observations and rellections have been made during the intervals taken from a business still pressing, at a time of life when most men desire rep(^se. They are given to the cause of American nationality, and may claim to be at least an old surgeon's offering on the altar of his country. The ^lag of our Union, the glorious Stars and Stripes, has repeatedly protected me in foreign lands l)eneath its broad folds, and if what I have â– written here shall be in any measure successful in prevent- ing the sufferings and prolonging the lives of that noble army who are now serving under m^' country's banner, I shall receive my reward.

24 tic. By others, a drachm of calcined magnesia, assisted in its action by draughts of lemonade, is prefered. No other purga- tion will be needed, unless exceptionally, to meet particular in- dications. Doctor Stone, of New Orleans, if the patient be Been early, advises fifteen grains, or a scruple of quinine, im- mediately. This may be followed, by ten grains more, in the course of twelve hours. Beyond this, he would not go. He thinks the medicine, thus given, prolongs and promotes dia- phoresis, and that " the patient is safe whilst this lasts." During the febrile stage, cold affusion or cold sponging is grateful and refreshing. Affusion may be practiced, as recom- mended in remittent fevers. The violent neuralgic pains may be best relieved by dry cupping, or by rubefacients, as sina- pisms, chloroform, or the like. Thirst may be assuaged by cooling drinks, such as acidulated barley or tamarind water, lemonade, or a weak sweetened solution of cream of tartar. During the second stage, expectation is demanded. Great care should be taken to preserve perfect rest of mind and body pending this period of calm. Strict watch should be kept that the patients do not uncover their l)odies or limbs, whilst care is taken that no undue weight of bed-clothes op- press or overheat them. The sick should never be moved by rough handling. When necessary to change their place in bed, a nurse should station himself on each side of it, and effect the desired end by lifting the under sheet, thus trans- porting the patient, without touching him. This is necessary to prevent uncovering, and on account of the exquisite muscular tenderness, and liability to bruise any part, to which strong pressure is applied. For the thirst which sometimes exists, there is nothing more grateful or appropriate than cold carbonated water, pellets of ice, or the effervescing draught of our pharmacopcea. If

26 VACCINATION IN ARMIKS. ously vaccinated, T-i liad liad smallpox naturally, and 52 had not been inoculated either with the variolous or vaccine virus, and had not had the disease naturally. Of the 560 previously vaccinated, 381 exhibited good cicatrices; in 134 they wei'e in- distinct or imperfectly developed; and in 45 no cicatrices were visible. Of the 560 previously vaccinated, 196 took the disease on revaccination, iuchiding 55 which froni the irregular prog- ress of the vesicle were regarded as afibrding a partial protec- tion from the smallpox. Of these 196,109 had been previously vaccinated before the age of live years; 48 between the ages of live and ten ; and 39 subsequentl}^ to the latter age. To de- termine, then, the period dui'ing which vaccination gives a " charmed life," it is necessary to institute a comparison be- tween these and the whole nnmber vaccinated. Thus, of the 560 previously vaccinated, 316 took place before the age of live years; 133 between the ages of five and ten years; and 111 after the latter period. TIence it follows, though not as an exact result, that as the ages of the great majority of the men ranged from twenty to thirty-three (the average being twenty- five years), and as the ratio of successful revaccination is very nearly the same after each interval of age (being about one- third), the limit of the protective powers of cowpox is not re- stricted to any precise number of years. These relative i-atios among the 560 previously vaccinated, may be thus represented : ^"'iÂ«<^^- under 10. upwards. ^o'"'- Number of vaccinations 315 133 111 560 Number of successful revaccinations... 109 48 39 196 The only statistics of revaccination of the present army we have been able to obtain are the following, kindly furnished by Dr. S. 0.

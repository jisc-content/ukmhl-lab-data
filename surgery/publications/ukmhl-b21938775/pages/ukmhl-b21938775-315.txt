13 tion has probably been in some- instances mistaken for rheumatism and perhaps treated in the ordinary manner, but it was merely one of the signs of general cachexia, and advantageously treated by a return to the comforts of ordinary life. Hemeralopia and nyctalopia, which are not infrequently met with among soldiers and sailors, are undoubtedly often due to a scorbutic taint. Dr. Coale,* U. S. Navy, noticed several cases of the latter in the scurvy which occurred on 1)oard the frigate Columbia in 1838-'39 and '40. Dr. Foltzf witnessed several cases of both these singular affections as accompaniments to the scurv}^, which attacked the crew of the United States frigate Raritan in 1846. In the Crimean Avar hemeralopia, though not adverted to in the ofhcial reports from which we have already quoted, was, according to Macleod, | a common attendant on scurv}'' as it appeared among the British troops. The writer has seen but two cases of either affection which were of undoubted scorbutic character. Both of these were hemeralopia or day blindness, and occurred in New Mexico. The blindness Avas almost complete on bright clear days. As evening approached the patients began to see with more distinctness, and at dusk possessed nearly the natural poAvers of A^ision. We must not forget to allude to the influence of the scorbutic diathesis in modifying the character of Avounds, in causing gangrene, in the production of bed-sores, in preventing the reunion of fractured bones, &c., Ave cannot, however, do more than simply call attention to these com- plications. oAmericau Journal of the Medical Sciences, vol.

Sometimes, a fever of reaction follows the second stage, termi- nating in recovery or death, as may be. la yellow fever, the pulso is accelerated, but not, according to general experience, to the same degree as iu nearly all other serious diseases of febrile or inflammatory nature. In diflerent epidemics it varies in regard to strength, sometimes being full, hard.and bounding; at others, sraalU soft and easily compressed. During the post- febrile stage, it is typically adynamic—often feeling as though the artery were filled with gas, instead of blood, so remarkably unresisting is it to the pressure of the finger—extreme slowness is often conjoined with these latter characteristics. In tlie last case treated by a member of the committee, it was only forty to the minute, for several days ; having previously been as high as one hundred and twenty.

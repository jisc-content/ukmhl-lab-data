The attention of the Sanitary Commission has been directed to the fact, that most of our Army Surgeons, now in the field, are unavoid- ably deprived of many facilities they have heretofore enjoyed for the consultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place within their reach anything that can be termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution, among the medical staff, of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying, in a condensed form, the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and sur- gical questions which are likely to present themselves to surgeons in the field, on the largest scale, and which are, therefore, of chiei practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing papers on several subjects of this nature, to certain of its associate members, in our principal cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names are the best evidence of their fitness for their duty. The following paper on " Hemorrhage from Wounds^ and the best means of arresting it,'''' belongs to this series, and the name of its distinguished author renders it unnecessary for the Commission to recommend it to the Army.

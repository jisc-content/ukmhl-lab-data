The attention of The United States Sanitary Commission has been directed to the fact, that most of our Army Surgeons, now in the field, are unavoid- ably deprived of many facilities they have heretofore enjoyed for the con- sultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place within their reach any thing that can he termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution among the medical Btafi^ of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying, in a condensed form, the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions whicii are likely to present themselves to surgeons in tlie field, on the largest scale, and which are, therefore, of'-hier practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing papers on several subjects of this nature, to certain of its associate members, in our prii'-^ipal cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names are the bes evi- dence of their fitness for their duty. The following paper on " Amputations" belongs to this series, and v re- spectfully recommended by the Commission to the medical officers ol 'ur army now in the field. Fred. Law Olmsted, Washington, Dec. 6, 1861. Secretary.

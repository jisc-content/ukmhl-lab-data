11 • lated before the malleolar projections are removed, which it is always proper to do, and which may be most easily effected by passing a knife around the exposed extremities of the bones, and then savvino- off a thin slice of the tibia connectinir the two processes.* Mr. Syme directs the articular surface of the tibia always to be removed. This, certainly, should be done, if the disease has attacked the part; but, if healthy, it seems to be unnecessary. In one of the writer's cases, the extremity of the tibia was removed, but without any apparent benefit as respects the result. The following wood-cuts, of reduced size, taken from similar illustra- tions in the Monthly Jour, nal, Feb. 1850, give a more correct idea of the line of incision than can any verbal description. It will be seen that they differ very mate- rially from those given in text books. The principal precaution to be observed, is in the dissection on the posterior part of the os calcis, in order not to wound the posterior tibial artery, and thus deprive the flap of its nourishment. It is recommended by some surgeons to disarticulate be- fore dissecting the posterior flap. This proceeding in- creases the liability to wound this vessel, nor does it facilitate the ope- ration. The artery may readily be avoided by keeping the edge of the knife constantly turned from the flap towards the bone. By this means also, the operator will not be liable to puncture the posterior flap—an accident which has occasion- ally occurred, but which does no harm. * Syme's CeiUributions to Surgery.

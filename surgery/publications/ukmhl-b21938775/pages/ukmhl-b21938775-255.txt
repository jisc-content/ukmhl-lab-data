t servation of the anterior tibial is therefore of great import- ance. Tlie application of adliesive straps in sncli a way as to keep the osseons surfaces approximated, and yet allow a free exit to all discharge, a carved side-splint, such as is some- times used for fracture of the leg, and the resting of the limb on a pillow, are the chief features of the subsequent local treatment. TARSUS. The OS calsis and part of the astragalus, and the os calcis alone, were successfully removed in the Crimea, the former once, and the latter four times. The os calcis, in cases of its comminution without implication of any other bones, must frequently permit of excision when amputation would otherwise be necessary. With this exception, gun-shot wounds of the tarsus, though the}^ sometimes authorize at- tempts at prescrraiive surgery, rarely justity conservative * steps. SMALL JOINTS OF THE HAND AXD FOOT. Injuries of the metacarpo or metatarso-phalangeal and phalangeal joints o^ the fingers and toes seldom leave a choice between excision and amputation, except in cases of compound dislocation. This, in the toes, is infrequent, and hardly met with except at the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe. Both here and in the thumb, excision is a more judicious treatment than simple reduction, and averts- the grave inflammation and suppuration which almost in- variably follow the accident. In excising the joints of the fingers, it must be borne in mind that the preservation of motion is most important in the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, or in those of the proximal phalanges ; for if the proximal be stiff, no amount of motion in the distal joint can be of service; but if the proximal joint can be voluntarily flexed, a very small degree of mo-

7 poultices aiKl sedative lotions. But tins reason may be made stronger; since Pmn is positkcltj fnjiirious to the pained. If sufficiently acute and long-continued, it will of itself produce death. The collapse which follows severe injuries, where there is little loss of blood, is to be attributed entirely to pain. When death occurs in such cases without reaction, it is the direct eflcct of pain. Ambrose Pare, the father of modern surgery, in speaking of pain, says, "nothing so much dejects the powers of the patient." Gooch says, "mere pain can destroy the powers of life." My friend, Mr. Travers, observes, "pain, when amounting to a certain degree of intensity and duration, is of itself destructive." And I myself, like every other sur- geon, in active practice, am continually witnessing injuries where death results solely from the nervous shock. ■ In corroboration of this -fact, we may notice, cn jxfmmt, the Statistics of Amputations, collected by Professor Simp- son, of Edinburgh. It is not necessary to quote them at length, but they come, by numeric process, to this^ conclu- sion—that in all serious surgical operations the prevention of pain, by the use of anaisthetics, gives to the patient not only present relief, but also a better prospect of subsequent recovery—the mortality in such cases being clcarl}^ lessened by the use of anaesthetics. We see, then, that pain has the etiect, primarily and directly, to depress the powers of life. If we inquire into the cause of this, we shall find it in the physiological law, that the nervous s)/stei)i conlvoh the vascular, and tlie collapse which attends severe injuries has its origin in the nervous system. Collapse is a provision for defending the nervous centres from an intolerable assault, «

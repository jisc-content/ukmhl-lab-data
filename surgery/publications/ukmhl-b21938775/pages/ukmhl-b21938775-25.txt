15 There is another practical fact in regard to the nse of In* halations which I do not remember to have noticed. If the patient mmit, the effect huriicdiaieti/ passes off, and, as he is mnch more likely to vomit when the stomach is full, he should not be allowed food for some hours previous to inhalation. In operations where the mouth becomes filled with blood, I was formerly ap]5rehensive of strangling, Imt subseqaent observation shows that during anaesthesia, deglntitiofi takes place by means of reflex nervous action, in the same manner that uterine contractions occur, notwithstanding the use ot" these ao;ents. Within the last year, Professor Simpson, of Edinburgh, has recommended a new plan for securing the admixture of the proper quantity of air. It consists in spretiding a handker- chief single-fold over the face of the patient, and allowing the .liquid to fall drop by drop upon it near the mouth and nose. The quantity of the liquid required by this method is said to be less than what is ordinarily used, but from my experience I should apprehend irritation of the skin, as this is apt to occur in usii}g chloroform and sether by the ordi- nary method. To prevent this irritation I am in the habit of applying previous to inhalation a little olive oil about the mouth and nostrils. Care should also be taken to prevent the vapor from acting on the eyes. In my own practice I have been in tlie habit of using the Scotch chloroform of Duncan, Flockhart & Co., of Edinburgh, but have also employed that of Dr. Squibb, of Brooklyn, and with pleasure commend the latter for its purity and reliability. For such reasons, then, as have been recounted, I desire to direct the attention of the Surgeons of the Army and N"avy to the advantages which would accrue from a more

The attention of tlie Sanitary Commission has been directed to the fact, that most of our Army Surgeons, now in the field, are unavoid- ably deprived of many facilities they have heretofore enjoyed for the consultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossi- ble to place within their reach anything that can be termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribu- tion among the medical staif of a series of brief essays or hand-books, embodying, in a condensed form, the conclusions of the highest medi- cal authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions which are likely to present themselves' to surgeons in the field, on the largest scale, and which are, therefore, of chief practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing papers on sev- eral subjects of this nature to certain of its associate members, in our principal cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names are the best evidence of their fitness for their duty. â€¢The following paper on "Excision of Joints for Traumatic Cause" belongs to this series, and is respectfully recommended by the Commis- sion to the medical ofiicers of our army now in the field.

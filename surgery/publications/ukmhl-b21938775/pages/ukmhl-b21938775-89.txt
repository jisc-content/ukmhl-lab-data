The attention of Tlio United States Sanitary Commission has been directed to tlie fact, that most of our Army Surgeons, now in tlie field, are unavoid- ably deprived of many facilities they have heretofore enjoyed for the con- sultation of standard medical authorities. It is obviously impossible to place witliiu their roach any thing that can be termed a medical library. The only remedy seems to be the preparation and distribution among the medical stafif, of a series (.)f brief essays or hand-books, embodying, in a condensed form, the conclusions of the highest medical authorities in regard to those medical and surgical questions which are likely to present themselves to surgeons in the field, on the largest scale, and which are, therefore, of chief practical importance. The Commission has assigned the duty of preparing papers on several subjects of this nature, to certain of its associate members, in our principal cities, belonging to the medical profession, whose names are the best evi- dence of their fitness for their duty. Tlie following paper on the Value of Vaccination in Armies" belongs to this series, and is rosjiectfully recomii'.ended by the Commission to the medical officers of our army now in the field. Fked.

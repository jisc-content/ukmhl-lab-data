find the opinion expressed that warm, wet weather, is propitious to its development. Ample experience exists to prove that but little reliance can be placed on the absence of undue heat and moisture, in the way of ensuring exemption from epi- demics. The testimony of JSTew Orleans physicians and of Doctor Blair, in Demerara, conclusively prove that " more or less rain or a greater or less degree of heat has very little to do with tlie production of yellow fever." Age a7ul Sex.—Neither of these etiological elements are sources of exemption ; nor do they exercise an influence Avhich would make tlieir consideration a matter of importance to the Army Surgeon. Fever may occur and prove fatal at any time of life. That men die in larger numbers than women admits of a self-evident explanation. Race.—Negroes may take yellow fever, and they may die of it. In comparison with other races, their slight liability to suffer is very remarkable. In the United States, this exemp- tion is observed, in the mulatto, in direct ratio to the amount of African blood. The more Caucasian, the greater liability to sicken and to die. A full-blooded African rarely contracts the disease, even when freshly imported from his native country and placed in the midst of an epidemic. It has been said, and is generally believed, that robust, stent, or plethoric people are more apt to be attacked than those of opposite temperament. Inasmuch as such persons constitute the majority of individuals liable to the disease, from want of acclimation, we may find a more philosophical explanation of their greater susceptibility than by reference to tempei'ament. Condition and Occupation.—all persons, soldiers and sailors sufier most from yellow fever. It is veiy fatal among prostitutes. Many cases have been observed, in some of the

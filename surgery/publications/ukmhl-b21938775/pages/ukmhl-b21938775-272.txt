.prevn.il. In otlior words, the intensity of the cause becomes so great, that instead of merely displaying its action upon those already sick,and furnishing a typical physiognomy to othei- affec- tions, the typlious poison is powerful enough to generate its pecu- liar plienomena iu persons merely enfeebled, but not yet spe- cifically diseased. Consequently, there have been epidemics of diarrhoea, dysentery, pneumonia, intermittent fever, typhoid fever, and typhus, simultaneously in the same camp, hospital, or town, in which it seemed difficult to determine wliich was the original, and which the superadded affection, so intermingled did the periodical and the typhous phenomena become with one another, and'with those which belonged to the local lesions of several of the affections. An attentive analysis will, however, generally reveal which of the symptoms of any given case are owing to a local and material morbid change, and which must be attributed to the general blood or nerve disease. Or, if the type affection predominates in all the phenomena occasioned by the local disorder, it will still be possible to distinguish both the one and the other as we do the physical properties of a sul)- stance through a coating of varnish that invests it. Typhoid dysentery is, then, in its simplest form, a variety of dysentery in which the phenomena of the typhoid state are superadded to those which are characteristic of dysentery. To this alone tiie following description applies. The more complex cases will be alluded to under the head of Comj^lications. In the great majority of cases diarrhoea precedes the proper dysenteric symptoms for some time, particularly among those vrho liave been subjected to the influence of debilitating causes. When these have been in operation for a considerable time, the patient rapidly acquires a cachetic appearance upon the super- vention of the dysenteric symptoms proper, if not before, the skin becoming muddy and pale, or mottled also with ecchy- -moses, the hands and feet edematous, and the countenance

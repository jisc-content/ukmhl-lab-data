VENEREAL DISEASES- It is in the liighest degree gratifying to be able to assert, upon tlie antliority of tlie reports of the sni'geons of tlie United States army now in the field, that in modern times there has never been collected so large a body of men. among whom venereal diseases have prevailed to so small an extent. Since, however, this class of diseases is still a fruitful source of the disqualification of men for active service, the following attempt has been made, at the request of the Sanitary Commission, to embody, in as brief a space as possible, the teachings of mod- ern science upon this subject, with special reference to the wants of army surgeons. SECTIO^sT 1. PREVENTION OF VENEREAL DISEASES. The following regulations, enforced in the Belgian army, have been found by experience to render venereal diseases " by far less frequent." So far as practicable, they are worthy of adoption in our own army. 1. Evciy soldier who contracts venereal disease, should be required to give the name and address of the woman who in- fected him ; and if, upon examination, she be found diseased, her removal from the neighborhood should be enforced by the military authority. 2. Every inducement should be jiresented to lead men to report themselves at the earliest possible moment after infec- tion ; and delay should be visited with appropriate penalties. 3. No person with any venereal disease, however slight, should be allowed to remain in quarters, but bo at once trans- ferred to the hospital.

10 VACCINATION IN AKMIKS. London," states that the mortality from smallpox in i\\QunvaG- cinated, of cases taken generally, is tJivrty-fivejper cent., but of children under five years of age, it is fifty ])er cent.; and of those who recover, a great many suffer permanent disfigure- ment, some loss of sight, and others have their health greatl}' damaged. The mortality, on the contrary, amongst the vaccinated, attacked by smallpox, is seven per cent., taken generally; but among those who may be characterized as the hadly vaccinated, it is fifteen per cent. Amongst those, on the other hand, who may be considered to be well vaccinated, that is to say, who have four or more good vaccine cicatrices, the mortality is less than one jper cent. In the report of the " Smallpox and Vaccination Committee of the Epidemiological Society" of London, presented to the British Parliament in 1853, is collected a mass of evidence abundantly sustaining the protective influence of vaccination. As resiilts are most desirable in a communication like the present, the following statistics collected by the Society are presented : 1st. To prove the influence of vaccination in England: out of every 1,000 deaths in the half-century from 1730 to 1800, there were of smallpox 96. Out of every 1,000 deaths in the half-century from 1800 to 1850, there were of smallpox 35. 2d. To prove the influence of vaccination on the Continent: in various German States suflicient evidence can be obtained to show that, before vaccination was used, out of every 1,000 deaths, there occurred from smallpox 66.5; after vaccina- tion, 7.26. 3d. To prove that in countries where vaccination is most perfectly carried out, smallpox is least mortal: {a.) In this country (England), where vaccination is volun- tai'y, and frequently neglected, the deaths from all causes being 1,000, the deaths from smallpox in the following towns are as follows; London, 16; Birmingham, 16.6; Leeds, 17.5; Eng- land and Wales, 21.9; Paisley, 18 ; Edinburgh, 19.1; Perth. 25; Glasgow, 36; Dublin, 25.66; Galway, 35; Limerick, 41; (Jonnaught, 60 ; all Ireland, 49.

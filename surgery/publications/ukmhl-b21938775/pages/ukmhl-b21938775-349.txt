15 of apparatus that is used will be made more tolerable by the suspension of the entire limb. It is better in these cases, in fitting the wire splint, to make the angle at the knee more obtuse than for a fracture of the thigh, and always to hang the limb in such a way that the broken bones may be horizontal. Should lateral angular deformity occur after fracture of the leg, it must be corrected by a careful adaptation of Dupuytren's plan, by binding the limb to a lateral splint, with a wedge-shaped compress arranged so as to bear against the projecting angle. When, at an advanced stage of the treatment of fractures of the leg, pasteboard splints are used, they should always be applied to the sides of the limb; never to its posterior surface. Fractures of the tarsal and metatarsal bones, as seen in military prac- tice, are very apt not only to be compound, but to require amputation. In favorable cases, inflammation being subdued, a pasteboard splint should be accurately fitted to the front of the leg and back of the foot. When a fracture-box, like that recommended for the leg, can be had, it will ensure greater comfort to the patient, especially if he has to be moved any distance. JOHN H. PACKARD, Chairman. GEORGE W.

ON SCURVY. Scurvy is a disease which, from whatever point it is regarded, cannot fail to attract the attention of the thought- ful military surgeon. Formerly its victims in armies and navies were to be counted by thousands annually, and if at the present time its ravages are not so extensive as a few years since, the fact that it is still not infrequently met with shows that either we are not cognizant of all its causes or that we ignorantiy or wilfully allow those circumstances to exist by which it inevitably will be induced. The subject is one also which ought, in many of its con- nections, to receive the earnest consideration of every military commander who has the good of his troops at heart. It lies Avith him to carry out those hygienic measures which his medical staff may recommend, and he ought to know that the occurrence of one single case of this disease in his command shows the existence of causes Avhich will surely give rise to it in others, and in a short time render his force miserable, inefficient, and a burden to the public it was intended to serve. Scurvy is preeminently a preventable disease, and its existence in an army is 'prima facie evidence that the medical or military authorities have been neglectful of their duties. It would be manifestly out of place in an essay of the purely practical character of this to enter at length into the history of the disease under consideration. It would appear.

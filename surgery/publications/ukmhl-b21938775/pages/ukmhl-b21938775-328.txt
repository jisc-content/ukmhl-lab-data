26 estimation of the civilized world, and for many years has formed a component part of the ration of seamen so situ- ated as to be liable to scurvy. In the English navy, lime- juice is issued when the men have been for fourteen days on salt-meat diet. By this one article scurvy has been almost eradicated from modern navies. Citric acid is not a substi- tute, it being almost entirely inert as we have found by experience. It can scarcely be said that pure vegetable acids are anti- scorbutics. Vinegar cannot, therefore, be elevated to this rank. The lime-juice doubtless owes its valuable properties to the fact that it contains supercitrate of potassa. We have already alluded to the efficacy of potash as an anti-scorbutic. In a paper published in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences for we gave the results of our experience up to that time with potash in this connection. Since then we have had abundant opportu- nity of using it, and have seen nothing to cause us to modify the opinion then expressed of its great value. As a prophylactic of scurvy we regard it as invaluable. At Cebolletta, in New Mexico, where the Avrit'er was stationed several years, the men of the garrison never had scurvy originating in them at that place, though it prevailed very extensively at other ports in the territory. Upon analyzing the water in use it was found to contain a large proportion of potash, and to this fact the immunity from scurvy was attributed. The bitartrate is perhaps the best form in which to employ potash as an anti-scorbutic. It is more easily pre- served and transported than lime-juice, and is, moreover, cheaper. An ounce of it taken daily when the men are so situated as to render them liable to scurvy, would, we are

AMPUTATIONS. 6 9. Compound fractures of the middle and lower part of the thigh, occasioned by gun-shot, require amputation. As regards similar injuries in the upper two-thirds of the thigh, the mor- tality following amputations has been so very great that army surgeons have generally abandoned the operation. Dr. McLeod, after a careful inquiry into this point, says: â€¢'Under circumstances of war, similar to those which occurred in the East, we ought to try to save compound comminuted fractures of the thigh, when situated in the upper third; but immediate amputation should be had recourse to in the case of a like accident occurring in the middle and lower third.'' Such cases must be left to the judgment of the Surgeon. 10. Gun-shot wounds of the knee-joint demand amputation. The operation of excision, in the very few cases in which it has been practised by army surgeons, has not been attended by favorable results. This want of success is not, however, to con- demn, except upon the field of battle, an operation which has been so successfully performed in cases of disease. 11. Gun-shot fractures in the middle of the leg do not neces- sitate amputation, unless the arteries are destroyed, or the in- juries involve the neighboring joints. 12. Gun-shot injuries of the ankle do not necessarily require amputation. If the posterior tibial artery and nerve have escaped injury, and if the bones be not too extensively commi- nuted, attempts may be made to save the limb. 13. Great care should be exercised, before proceeding to amputation, to ascertain whether a patient may not be other- wise mortally wounded. THE TIME FOR OPERATING. In army-practice, on the field, amputation, when necessary, ought to be primary. Patients, in most cases, cannot bear re- moval from the field witiiout increased danger, neither can they have afierNvards the hygienic attentions which secondary am- putations must necessarily require.

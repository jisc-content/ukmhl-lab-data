tliem. To tliese its origin may be traced at seasons of tlie ycaF wlien tlie cause in question docs not operate, e. _</., in niidwinler. It is tlien, especially, that a neglect of hygienic measures is attended with the most fatal results ; when the inclemency of I he weather, prompting an effort to economize fuel, or to disj)cnse with it, induces the poorer classes of citizens to shut out tlie air, as perfectly as possible, from their ill-built dwellings ; und soldiers, crowded in tents, to supply, by their animal heat, the warmth which they require. They forget, or do not know, that every moment the}' are generating a poison which contaminales the atmosphere, and probably clings to evei-y fixed arlicle within the dwelling, and, sooner or latei-, prostrates them as victims to typhus or to dysentery, or to both combined in one disease. It is a remarkable fact that the only place, in noiili- ern latitudes, where cholera raged as an epidemic in winter, was St. Petersburgâ€”a city in which all the houses remain her- metically sealed during the cold season, and are heated l)y stoves in such a manner as almost entirely to prevent a renewal of the air. The history of typhoid dysentery is equally in- structive, for it has always prevailed in crowded ships, and especially slavers ; in prisons, barracks, besieged places, and canips, where men were crowded together, the air was imperfectly renewed, and the exhalations and excretions were allowed to mix with the atmosphere, and poison it; and when to the.-e in- fluences were added, as more direct and exciting causes, inclem- ent weather, excessive fatigue, depressing emotions, inteniper' ance, and insufficient or unwholesome food, and water eitlicp naturally impure, or rendered so by holding decaying matters in suspension. So influential does the last named cause become, even in ordinary civil life, that, as it has been shown in Eng- land, the population, in the districts which suffer the highest dcatli-ratcs from bowel affections, bi'cathes or drinks a largft amount of putrefying animal refuse.

32 VACCINATION IN ARMIES. the middle of tlie tube as tlie contained air cools, and you complete the process by sealing lastly tlie oriiice by which it entered. It should be observed, that in no case is a tube to be laid down until the lymph has been made to pass towards the mid- dle of it, for the fluid concretes quickly about the orifice, and you cannot afterwards detach it without difliculty ; but if it be at once made to pass away from the orifice by holding the tube vertically, you may lay the charge down and take half a dozen or more in the same way before sealing them ; only if you delay the sealing process too long, more than five (U' ten minutes perhaps (a delay which need never happen), the lymph within the tube is apt, from evaporation, to become adherent, especially if it be more than ordinarily viscid, and it cannot afterwards be blown out when you come to use it. If the lymph do not exude freely, the tube may require to be drawn several times more or less obliquely across the surface of the vesicle or cluster of vesicles until a sufficient charge has entered ; but generally, if the exudation be copi- ous, and a drop of some size has formed before you begin to take your supply, the orifice of the tube need not, indeed ought not, to touch the surface, but is merely to be dipped into the clear fluid; and one may commonly in this manner, from one arm, charge five or six tubes in almost as many seconds with perfectly pure and limpid lymph, which shall contain neither epithelial scales, nor pus globules, nor blood disks, and therefore be, so far, in the best possible condition for preserva- tion. In order to obtain the lymph from a tube for the purpose of vaccinating, the sealed ends are broken off, and the contents blown out gently on the point of the lancet or vaccinator. The tubes may be easily and safely sent by ])()St in the fol- lowing manner: A flat piece of soft fir, about three inches and a half long, an inch and a half wide, and one-sixth of an inch thick, has a narrow and sluiUow groove made in it about a quarter of an inch wide, into which the charged tubes, two or more of them, are placed, with perhaps a few filanienrs of cotton beside then-

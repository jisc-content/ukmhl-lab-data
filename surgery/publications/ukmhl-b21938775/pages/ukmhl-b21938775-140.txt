6 fifth, in front of the articdatioii of the toes with the metatarsus. 2d. The articuhations are opened in succession with the point of the knife, and their ligaments divided. 3d. The knife is then carried behind the phalanges for the purpose of cutting out a semi-circnlar flap from the plantar surface of the foot.— Lisfrands Method in Bernard and Huette. EXCISION OF INDIVIDUAL METACARPAL BONES. It occasionally happens that the local injury is of such a nature that by careful dissection the individual metacarpal bones may be removed, and the remainder of the foot be pre- served. This is always preferable to any more considerable mutilation of the foot, and should not on any account be over- looked. AMPUTATION AT THE TAESO-METATARSAL ARTICULATION. If the injury involves so much of the extremity of the foot as to raise the question of amputation at a point higher than those already indicated, the surgeon should make every exer- tion to save the tarsus entire. If the soft parts allow it, this can be accomplished by amputation at the tarso-metatarsal articulation. The following description of the operation is condensed from Bernard and Huette :— To recognise the A7'ticulatio7i.~lst. On the inner side of the foot carry the finger backward along the inner border of the metatarsal bone until a projection is encountered, one or two lines beyond; this is the articulation, situated in a depression between the two projections. Tlic articulation may also be found just one inch anterior to the prominence of the scaphoid bone. 2d. On the outer side follow the external border of the fifth metatarsal bone, until the prominence at its proximal extremity is recognised; the articulation lies immediately behind it; in some instances, the head of the metatarsal bone projects a trifle beyond the articulation.

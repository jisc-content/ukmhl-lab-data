9 scurvy is always thus clearly manifested. Cases are fre- quently met with in which another disease seems to be present, but which is only a symptom of the scorbutic dis- order. Or the scurvy may be so overshadowed by a coex- istent affection as to render its presence more a matter of inference than of actual proof. AVe propose to devote a short space .to the consideration of these complications. Scurvy is frequently met with associated with dysentery and typhus and typhoid fevers. Wc have had many examples of these combinations under our charge. Dr. Tholozan, in a paper read before the French Academy of Medicine, thus alludes to them : â– " Dysenter}', scorbutus, and typhus, sucli as we know them by classical description, consist of groups of morbid phenomena perfectly distinct from each other. When these affections are met with singly in an uncomplicated state, it is easy to recognise them, and no observer will be deceived by them. But when the diseases are mingled one v\-ith the other, or, as sometimes happens, when all three are conjoined, forming, as has been so often observed in armies, compound diseases of mixed character of special types, the pathologi- cal problem becomes complicated. Dysentery presents the characteristics of scorbutus, scorbutus is attended with delirium, as is typhus, or rather dysenteric fluxes carry ofl the patient, and those affected with typhus, have dysentery and become scorbutic. Examples of these mixtures are not rare, for almost all serious cases are thus complicated. Such at least Avas my experience during the wintei' of 1854- 55, at Constantinople." "Pincoffs also points out the frequency with which scurvy was conjoined with other diseases during the Crimean war. He says : "Experiences of a civilian in eastern military hospitals, &o.

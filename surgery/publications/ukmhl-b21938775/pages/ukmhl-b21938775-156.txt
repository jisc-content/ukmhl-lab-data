22 GENERAL APPKECIATION OF THE ABIPUTATIONS OF CHOPART, 6YME, AND PIROGOFT. TakiDs^ the foi-egoii!<? facts as the basis of an appreciation of the comparative merits of these several operations, with such suggestions from experience as may occur to us, we are pre- pared to determine their relative value, and definitively apply the rules in operative surgery already stated. 1st. The Ojjeration decidedhy Comparative Mortality.—Sta- tistics do not determine with sufficient accuracy the compara- tive mortality of these several amputations. It does not appear that the influence of the diseases or accidents for which ampu- tation was undertaken, upon the mortality, is estimated in these summaries. Chopart's operation has always been regarded as attended WMth very little danger. In Mr. Sj'me's ex- tensive experience in his own operation, the mortality is almost nominal. He states that he regards it as no more fatal than amputation of the finger; in 40 cases, he had but one death, and that was not fairly attributable to the operation. From our own observations we should not regard Syme's operation as any more fatal than Chopart's, in the same individual cases. jSlor can we believe, if we attach proper importance to tlie opinions of the eminent surgeons who have practised Pirogoff's method, already brought forward, that independently of the co-existent disease or injury, this operation is more dangerous than either of the two preceding amputations. • All speak with great confidence of its safety. If to the fore- going facts we add the additional consideration, that the danger in all these operations is for the most part the same, viz. the liability to suppurative inflammation in the sheaths of the divided tendons, we can but believe that the actual mortality from the three operations is not widely different. We may conclude, therefore, that— The comparative mortality of Chojyart's, Syme's, and Piro- goff's amjmtations is too slight to influeiice the Surgeon in his selection.

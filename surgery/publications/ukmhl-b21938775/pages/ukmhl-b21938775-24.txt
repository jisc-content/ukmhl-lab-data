arrest the circulation in the capillaries of the lungs, as nitrogen or hydrogen would do by exclusion of the necessary oxygen. Hence, in case of asphyxia from their use, where the natural process of respiration is interrupted, we endea- vor to substitute it by artificial means. We open the win- dows to procure fresh air, dash cold water in the face to excite convulsive i-espiratory movements, turn the patient on his side to lessen the gravitative tendency of the vapor, and make artificial respiration by compressing the ribs after the manner of Dr. Marshall Hall. And when the vapor is sufiSciently displaced from the lungs by admixture with atmospheric air, circulation and respiration will both be restored. For these reasous, it was, that Mv. McLeod, in the Crimea, always preferred to use chloroform in the open air. We see, then, that to exhibit anrcsthetic vapors too rapidly is to incur the danr/cr of asph'jxia; hut, on the other haiid, to exhibit them too slowly incommodes the surgeon and pro- longs inconveniently the stage of excitement; and a greater quantity of the an?esthetic" will also be required, and spas- modic action of the glottis is more likely to occur. Professor Simpson speaks of one or two minutes as being the proper time to allow for the induction of insensibility, but in this country it is customary to take a lono-fer time, perhaps from three to five minutes. The full effect of the anfcsthetie is indicated by sonorous or even stertorous breathing, which, though apparently serious, is of no importance. The pulse is generally but little affected, though it is ol'ten diminished somewhat in frequency and force, and yet I have seen it, when the vapor was being administered too rapidly, suddenly stop, to re- sume its ordinary motion when the effect of the vapor passed off.

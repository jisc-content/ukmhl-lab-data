REPORT. Diseases of malarious origin, especially febrile afiections due to this source, are of such importance to the army surgeon that the Sanitary Commission have judged it proper to devote a few i)ages to their consideration. Of the intimate nature of the "pallidal poison," " marsh mias- mata," or " malaria," we are in complete ignoi'ancc. Of the hypotheses thus far advanced, the most plausible are those which refer the morbific influence to the sporules of cryptogamic plants or to the infinitesiinal ova of infusoria. Nevertheless, these are mere theories, unsupported by demonstration addressed to the eye, through the medium of the most perfect microscopes; nor have partisans of the atmospheric or gaseous hypothesis been more successful in attempting to show, by eudiometry, the existence of-any peculiar matter in the air of infected places. This confession of ignorance still leaves us in possession of certain knowledge concerning malaria, from which much prac- tical good may be derived. 1st. It affects, by preference, low and moist localities. 2d. It is almost never developed at a lower temperature than 60° Fahrenheit. 3d. Its evolution or active agency is checked by a tempera- ture of 32°. 4th. It is most abundant and most virulent, as we approach the equator and the sea-coast. 5th. It has an affinity for dense foliage, which has the power of accumulating it, when lying in the course of winds blowing from malarious localities.

6 The wounds made by round bullets, (rarely those by Minie balls,) by fragments of shell, and occasionally tlioso from sabre-cuts, or from the smaller projectiles thrown by cannon, are almost the only injuries in which excisions can be attempted. Compound dislocations, sometimes happening from accidents in mounted drill, or possibly during an engagement, are thought by many authorities to demand removal of the projecting articulating surface, rather than simple reduction. The precise traumatic conditions to which these operations are adapted are not, however, easily determined. Gun-shot injuries of joints, especially in the lower exti'emity, are apt, either unquestionably to demand amputation, or else to hold out some hope from expectant treatment; the choice left is not the easy one between ex- cision and amputation, but the difficult and perplexing one between excision and an attempt to save a limb without an operation. A knee-joint completely shattered, with exten- sively lacerated soft parts, excites no doubt in the surgeon's mind as to what course he shall pursue. The single small bulIet-woLind, in the vicinity of an articulation, with no crepi- tus, a doubtful synovial discharge, and no local or constitu- tional symptoms, is a condition which eauAot but embarrass the most experienced in deciding upon so grave an operation as that of excision. Yet this is precisely the character of injuries in which the question of conservative operations is to be decided. A ball imbedded in or near an articulation may at first give rise to little disturbance, but if left to itself, will sooner or later excite the well-known signs of joint- injury, with long and wasting suppuration, deep and painful abscesses, and their concomitant dangers; and when these symptoms have manifested themselves, excision, or indeed any other operation, offers but little prospect of success. It is clear, then, that the circumstances, if not the cases, which permit of excision, must be of comparatively rare occurrence. The tendency of modern practice has led us to hope much from conservative surgery, and the success of ex- cisions for disease and for traumatic causes in civil hospitals has encouraged the expectation of results equally brilliant

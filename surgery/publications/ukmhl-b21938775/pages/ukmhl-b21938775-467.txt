ON THE USE OF PLASTER OF PARIS SPLINTS IN MILITARY SURaERY. The use of plaster of Paris in tlie treatment of fractures dates from a A'ery early period. Eaton, an English consul at Bassora, about the close of the last century, saw it employed by the Arabians. It was first employed in Europe b}^ Ilendrikes, at the hospital of Gronin- gen, in 1814, and afterwards by Ilubenthal, Kyle, and Dief- feubach. By these surgeons it was used in a very clumsy manner. Dieffenbach poured the plaster o\'er the limb, so as to inclose it in a solid casing; and it Avas necessary to use the hammer and chisel, in order to break the mould to remove it, thus jarring tlie limb and running the chances of injuring a newly consolidated fracture. These moulds have been justly called by Hamilton, "heavy stone cotfins, they might serve well cnougli the purpose of interment, but they are wholly unsuited to the purposes of a splint." Pirogoff, of St. Petersburg, in the year ISo-l, published a monograph on a new method of l)andaa'ino; fractured limbs with linen soaked in a solution of plaster of Paris. His method Avas as folloAvs : The limb was first bandaged and the depressions filled Avith raAV cotton, then splints of the coarsest linen, saturated in a solution of the plaster were applied lengtlnvise to the limb, and ftistened cross. Avise Avith strips saturated Avith tlie same nu^terial.

REPORT. It is proposed in tliis paper to consider briefly tliopc opera- tions in tlie region of tlie foot whicli are generally regarded as conservative. They are all undertaken -with a view either to preserve the largest extent of the extremity possible for snbse- qncnt unaided service, or to adapt a stump that affords the Lest medium for mechanical appliances. PRESKRVATIOX OF INDIVIDUAL TOES. It is alwaj's desirable'to preserve as many of the phalanges as possible. If the injury is of such a nature as to require the sacrifice of all but one toe, this should be preserved. The sup- port which is given to the foot in the mechanism of jn-ogression, by even the small toe alone, is sufficient to warrant its preser- vation. Especially is it important to save the great toe, which forms so considerable a part of the foot. AMPUTATION OF THE METATAKSO-PnALANGEAL AKTICULATION. When the injury requires the sacrifice of all the toes, the surgeon should, if the soft parts permit, remove tliem at their articulation with the metacarpal bones. Tiie resulting extre- mity will be extremely serviceable without artificial aid. Operation.â€”1st. The operator, grasping all the toes in his lelr hand, makes, with a narrow knife, a semi-circular incision, extending (for the left foot, and vice versa) from the internal border of the first metatarsal bone, to the external border of the

r 4 however, that it was not altogether unknown to the ancients, and that it was cured, as at present, by the use of fresh vegetable food. Modern armies and navies from the year 1260, when it attacked the army of Louis IX in Egypt, have never been free from it the entire twelve months. During the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries, when so many naval expe- ditions of warfare and discovery were fitted out, whole crews were destroyed by it, and in the course of the same periods it more than decimated the armies of several European nations. In more recent times, and notwithstanding the great advance which has been made in the knowledge of pre- venting and curing scurvy, it has not failed to take its victims by large numbers. Not to refer to other instances, it may be stated that our own armies have suffered greatly through its ravages. On one occasion, at Council Bluffs, in 1820, nearly the entire garrison was attacked, and many died. In Florida and in Mexico the efficiency of our forces was very materially lessened by its occurrence, and in Texas, New Mexico, and other frontier districts, cases of it have existed every year. In 1850 and 1851, it was very prevalent in New Mexico, and was in many instances extremely severe in its character. The numerous emigrants to the west have been attacked with scurvy to a great extent. In 1848 and 1849 several overland parties en route to California and Oregon were almost destroyed by it, and in 1855 and 1856 the writer witnessed many cases among the settlers in Kansas. In the Crimea, the English and French armies were afflicted with scurvy to an extent almost inconceivable at the present day. "We shall have occasion hereafter to again

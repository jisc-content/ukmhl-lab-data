VENEREAL DISEASES, 6 TIIEEE FOEMS OF VENKEEAL DISEASE. There are three separate and distinct venereal diseases, viz., Gonorrhoea, the Simple Chancre, or Chancroid, witli its at- tendant bubo, and Syphilis, including the initial lesion, or true chancre, and general symptoms. The first two are local, and the last a constitutional affection. SECTION II. GONOKKHffiA, AND ITS COMPLICATIONS. 1. The idea that gonorrhoea is dependent upon the syphilitic virus, and requires the use of mercurials, is without founda- tion. "To compel an unfortunate patient to undergo a course of mercury for a disease which does not require it, is a proceed- ing which reflects dishonor and disgrace upon the character of a surgeon."â€”(Sir Astley Cooper on the Use of Mercury in Gon- orrhoea at Guy's Hospital.) 2.

Inter- nally, a free purge at the outset, followed by la.xatives if neces- sary to insure a daily evacuation from the bowels; alkaline mixtures, as solutions of the carbonates of soda or potassa, the acetate or clilorate of potassa, liquor potassas, &c., and copaiva or cubebs. 3. Wlien the symptoms are decidedly inflammatory, they should first be subdued by rest, cathartics, and low diet, before resorting to injections. Injections are also contra-indicated in cases complicated with prostatitis, or cystitis. 4. Copaiva and cubebs should be "given in somewhat full doses from the outset of their administration, but. at the same tune, care should be taken not to carry them to the degree of intolerance. Excessive action upon the bowels should^be re- strained by opiates or astringents, in order that their active principle maybe eliminated by the kidneys and pass oif in the nnne. They should be suspended if they occasion iincon-

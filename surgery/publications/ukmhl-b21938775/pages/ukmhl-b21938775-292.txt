34 tliis method is applicable cliiefiy in the forming stage of the attack, at which time, if thecvacuant operation is thorougli, the further progress of tlie disease may be arrested or rendered very mild. Its use, however, should be restricted in cases in which the constitutional vigor is but slightly impaired. We cannot have too strongly impressed upon the mind that calomel, invaluable though it be on account of its gentleness as a purgative and its specific operation on the liver, may nevertheless expose the patient to danger by its primary de- pressing influence, and by the possibility of its occasioning salivation, or by the other and remoter effects of mercurial poisoning. In the decidedly sthenic variety of dysentery, the danger of these accidents is, indeed, very slight; and even in the bilious form they are comparatively small, if the medicine is used as a purgative only : but in either form they are greatly increased by tlie vicissitudes of military life. It, therefore, be- comes the duty of the army surgeon not to employ mercury in large or in small doses unless simpler remedies have proved in- eflicacious in other cases of the disease. When in doubtful cases it has been prescribed, its sojourn in the system should be prevented by the timely administration of castor oil or saline laxatives. It may not be amiss to remark that ipecacuanha in tlie small dose of one grain every four or six hours, has been proclaimed as a specific for all the active forms of dysentery. A larger dose than this occasions so much distress from nausea as to render it ineligible for repetition. In bilious dysentery the premature exhibition of opiates is to be sedulously avoided, because they check the secretion of bile wliich it is desirable, on the contrary to promote. But when once bilious evacuations have been procured, the administration pf small doses of wine of opium or of Dover's powder may be

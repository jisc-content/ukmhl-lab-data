10 tempted. This is generally admissible by the second or third week, and is to be practiced daily, unless contra-indicated by the symptoms or the extreme pain produced. The surgeon may console himself for the slow progress of his case by re- membering that the chances of anchylosis are said to be in proportion to the rapidity of cure. . ELBOW-JOINT. The exposed position of the elbow, both in loading and firing, makes it, like the shoulder, constantly the recipient of gun-shot injuries; and the choice between amputation and excision is far more difficult than in the last-named articula- tion, which from its anatomical position can, even under adverse circumstances, be kept tolerably immovable, and consequently free from many sources of after trouble with much greater ease than the elbow. Either for this or some other reason, not apparent, gun-shot wounds of the joint of the elbow less frequently do well without operation than those of the shoulder. When left to nature, the track of a ball which passes near the joint, as well as the joint itself, usually becomes carious, and ultimately demands excision. "I have seen," says Macleod, "several cases in which, after being traversed by a ball, attempts have been made to save the elbow without excising it; but such trials were any- thing but encouraging. The motion of the joint and its consequent use will be found much greater after excision than when the arm has been saved without operation." It would perluips seem that nothing could be more easy than to diagnosticate the injury which the bones of a joint like the elbow may have received. Such is not the case, how- ever. The whole upper end of the uliia may be crushed and fractured into the joint, yet leave no deformity, and allow the patient to perform all the usual movements. This is owing to one of the peculiarities of gun-shot fractures, viz: the preservation of the periosteum unlacerated, whereby the fragments ai'c bound together, and the form of the bone is

14 VENEREAL DISEASES. nitrate of silver (3 iij ad aquas f j); or by pressure, by means of coin])ressed sponge and a spica bandage. The latter always terminates in suppuration. ,â€¢ 9. As soon as fluctuation can be detected, the abscess should be opened, either by several small punctures, followed by an injection of the cavity with a solution of sulphate of zinc (gV. iij ad aquse 3 j ), or one part of tincture of iodine to four of water, and pressure, by means of a compress and spica ban- dage, be employed to insure adhesion of the walls; or the ab- scess should be freely opened by a vertical incision (not parallel to the inguinal fold), and the cavity, stuffed with lint, be loft to heal b_y granulation. 10. Suppuration in a bubo affords a probability, although not an absolute certainty, that the accompanying chancre is of the simple, non-infecting species; since it is a general but not invariable rule, that syphilis does not follow an open bubo. SECTION IT. SYPHILIS. 1. The term "syphilis" is used here to the exclusion of the local affection just referred to. The symptoms of this disease are commonly divided into primary (including the initiatory chancre and accompanying induration of the glands), and general (including the so-called secondary and tertiary mani- festations). 2. A true chancre is the initiatory lesion of acquired syphilis, appearing at the point where the virus entered the system, and separated from the general manifestations of the disease by a period of incubation pertaining to the hitter. Analogy would show that a chancre, like the vaccine vesicle, is already the re- sult of absorption of the virus and of infection of the constitu- tion, and not a mere local disease ; hence that its abortive treat- ment by destructive cauterization is incapable of averting general syphilis; hence, also, that it should receive the same general treatnient as the latter manifestations of the diathesis. Clinical experience conlirms this view, since thorough destruc-

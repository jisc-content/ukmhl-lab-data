The infectious maladies to A\'liich we shall particularly allude, are among the most strongly characterized of tlie zymotic diseases, and, with the exception of a single group, the specific poisons upon which they respectively depend infecHoiis d?"eas- are imquestiouaLly capable of being communicated fi'om es, how coinniiin- , • i , • ji , i A i • ,i icaied, and iiow tlic porsous siclv to pcrsous uninlectccl.

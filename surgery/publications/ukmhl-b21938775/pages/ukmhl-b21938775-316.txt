* ) I 14 Wc have pointed out,' at some length, associations of •scurvy with other disorders, because we are satisfied from much observation that a powerful cause of these diseases, the scorbutic condition of the system is frequently over- looked, both in diagnosis and treatment. The military medical officer cannot be too circumspect in his examination •of patients Avho are subje^cted to conditions favorable to the development of scurvy. He will frequently find, by careful observation, that his numerous cases of typhoid fever, diarrhcea, dysentery, rheumatism, frost-bites, &c., are' in great part due to that depraved state of the blood which is the essential characteristic of scurvy, even though many prominent symptoms of the latter disease be absent, and he will find that by enforcing' proper sanitary and medicinal treatment, the diseases which have resisted all his routine measures will be driven out, or, what is infinitely better, entirely prevented. Pathology.—It would not comport with the purely prac- tical character of this memoir to dwell to any extent upon the pathology of scurvy. In order, however, to inculcate a clear idea of the prophylaxis and treatment it ^vill be necessary to bring some of the more prominent points of this portion of the subject before the reader. We naturally look in the first place to the state of the blood, and we find a ver}'^ decided change from the normal condition of this fluid. We shall give an abstract only of our own researches on this point. •» 1st. The amount of ivater is increased and the total amount of solid matter diminished. 2d. The jihrin is augmented in quantity. 3d. There is a decided diminuation in the amount of Uoocb corpuscles. t

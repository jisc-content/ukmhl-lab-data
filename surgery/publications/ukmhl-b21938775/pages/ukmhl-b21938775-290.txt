If, after this, loose stools continue, the lead should be resumed, but not otherwise. The cautions in regard to diet during convalescence need not be rc|iealed here, but it may be rcniai-ked that they ought to be most sedulously observed in this gi-aver form of dysentery. Treatment of Bilious Dysentery.â€”The characteristic symp- toms of bilious dyscntei'v, it will be remembered, indicate de- rangoment of the stomach and liver, cither with active iuflara- matory symptoms, but less so than in the last form, or showing a tendency towards an adynamic condition of the system.

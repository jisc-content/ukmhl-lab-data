advanced stage still, tlie healing of extensive ulcers may occa- sionally produce a contraction or stricture of the bowel. In all of these cases abscesses in the cellular substance arouud the rectum are not uncommon. The exudation which has been referred to as belonging to certain grave forms of acute dysentery may, if the disease is greatly prolonged, become closely adherent to the raucous mem- brane, and even acquire a vascular connection with it, so that the raw surface which it leaves, on being removed, presents the- appearance of an ulcer. The false membrane itself is even susceptible of taking on the ulcerative process. It sometimes, also, assumes a fungous character and projects above the sur- face of the surrounding membrane. In very elironic foiMus of the disease, melanotic deposits are met with in the mucous membrane around healed ulcers, and elsewhere ; and in some cases the mesenteric glands are found to have undergone calcic fication. From this brief sketch of the lesions in dysentery it will be understood that although ulceration of the bowel is- seldom absent on post-mortem examination, there is necessarily an inflammatory process which precedes the loss of substance. In some cases of very rapid death from the typhoid form of the disease no ulceration has been detected, simply because time for its occurrence was wanting. Even tlie presence of blood in the stools is an insufficient proof that ulcers of the intestine exist. The practical value of this statement becomes apparent when we consider how much the efficacy of an appro- priate treatment must be increased, if it is applietl in tlie form- ing stage of the disease, before any injui-y to the structure of tlie intestinal mucous membrane has taken place. Definition and Forms of Dysentery.â€”Anatomically, dy- sentery is an inflammation of the follicles of the rectum and colon. Symptomatically it is a febrile affection characterized by colicky

95 COUNTER-STROKES. ner to evince the pernicious effefts of thefe counter-ftrokes. If there- fore, I can only give a rational analyfis of thefe faffs, accompanied with a mode of cure, adapted to the nature of thefe accidents and their caufe, I flatter myfelf that I (hall anfwer the two requisites of the proposition ; but, fenfible as I am of the difficulty of the undertaking, of my own in- sufficiency, and of the difcernment of thofe who are to decide upon the fubjedt, I am excited to engage in the attempt, rather by a defire of Shewing my zeal for the improvement of the art, than by any hope of fuccefs in the enterprize. A counter-ftroke, taken in the moft extenfive fienfe, is a Shock, which, from the part immediately Stricken, is tranfmitted to a greater or lefs dif- tance, and which produces, in its progreflion, mifchiefs more or lefs evident ; while the part which firft received the Shock, often remains uninjured. In a more confined fenfe, as we generally confider it in the firft in- stance, a counter-ftroke is a Shock which is conveyed from the part immediately Stricken, to other parts, and produces in them the fame mifchiefs, which the body giving the Shock would have occasioned, if thefe parts had been immediately expofed to its a&ion <hK When we are once acquainted with the laws, according to which, motion communicates itfelf and is loft, and with the circumftances necef- fary to occafion a congeries of Solid fibres, to yield more eafily in one place than in another, we may form a Sufficiently exaft theory of the effedls of counter-ftrokes on the hard parts. Several faffs will afford me the opportunity of elucidating the mechanifm of thefe counter-ftrokes; which will be better underftood, when it Shall only be an explanation of the manner in which Such and Such mifchief may have been pro- duced, in a part diftant from that which has received the] firft Shock. Thus, after having pointed cut the effecls of counter-ftrokes on the different parts of the body, exclufive of the head, I Shall Speak of the proper mode of treating them, according to the nature of the mifchief O o 2 which

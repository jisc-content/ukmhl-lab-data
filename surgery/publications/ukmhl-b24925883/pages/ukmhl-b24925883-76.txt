NOTES BY THE AUTHOR. jo (r) To this fact I can add another of the fame nature, in which the mifchiefs, though carried to a much higher degree than in the fore-men- tioned obfervation, are evidently yielding to the method I have been de- fcribing.—Michael Davoux came into the hofpital in Mav, 1778, with a compleat caries of the whole carpus, accompanied with three fiftulous openings, communicating with each other on the in fide and outlidc of the joint, the parts in the neighbourhood of the caries were oedematous, and fwelled to fo confiderable a bulk, that moft of the finders mcafured more than five inches in circumference. If we add to thele circumftan- ces a flow colliquative fever, with a foetid and plentiful difcharge, we fhall have an idea of the difeafe. The amputation of the fore-arm feemed indeed the only refource of the art in this cafe ; but before I de- termined on this operation, I was delirous at leaffc of giving a trial to the methods that had fucceeded fo well to me in fimilar cafes. Plcdeirs • * O dipt in the commanders balfam, placed upon the fiflulous openings, and confined by diachylon plaifters and comprefifes dipt in a balfamic embro- cation, have been the only remedies ufed for this patient, fince the time of his coming into the hofpital, to the end of September. Thele have been affifted by intervals of ten, fifteen, and twenty days between each renewal of the drelfings, and by maintaining the part in the rnoft con- ftant ftate of reft, by means of falfe junks. Thefe means have brought this terrible difeafe into a ftate that enables us to prognofticate its cure ; for at the time I am writing, all the fiftulous orifices on the back part of the hand are clofed ; and of thefe, which anfwered to thofe on the infide, there now remains but one, which furnilhes nothing but matter of a good confiftence, and in fmall quantity. Thefe circumftances, added to a very confiderable diminution in the bulk of the parts affecled, l'eem in fa£t to be the forerunners of an approaching cure. (f) It is fufticiently known, that a whole limb may be put in motion, while the circumference of a wound or ulcer, upon fome part of that limb, may be in a perfect ftate of reft. It is not therefore this fort of motion, that we mean to forbid here ; it is that kind that Ihould be exerted fo as to bear upon the injured pafcrt itlelf, and fo as to deftroy in it, the arrange-

ON THE EFFECTS OF ia6 this accident is included in what I have faid of the mifehiefs that are done to the hip joint, when there is a violent counter-ftroke felt in the cotyloide cavity of the os innominatum. 9 With refpeCt to the os facrum, though articulated by large lateral fur- faces with the ofla innominata ; and though firmly attached to thefe bones by intermediate cartilages, and by very ftrong ligaments, it is neverthe- lefs liable to at leaft partial disjunctions, from the violent counter-ftrokes it fometimes fuffers. We have too many inftances of this to call the. matter in queftion ; befides that, it is fuffleient to examine what happens in fome falls on the feet, to be convinced of the poflibility of a kind of disjunction of the os facrum from the os innominatum. Let us fuppofe that in one of thefe falls the direction of the motion fhall be luch, as that none of the lower parts can have fuffered either inflexion of frac- ture ; in that cafe, all the momentum of the upper parts, multiplied by their weight, is fpent upon the luperior part of the os facrum, which re- ceives a moft violent fhock from above downwards, while the ofla inno- minata remain unmoved. The os facrum is then driven like a wedge be- tween thefe twro bones; but the manner in which their articulating fur- faces are conftrufted, the cartilage which lines them, the connections which unite thefe bones to the os facrum, and the lateral preflure they then exert upon it, by means of the obliquity of the neck of the thigh- bone, are the reafon that none but the moft violent fhocks can produce the kind of disjunction we are fpeaking of; which might however be effected by another mechanifm, if nature had not provided againfl: it. In the cafe we have been fuppofing, the facrum, at the fame time that it is driven as a wedge between the two ofla innominata', endeavours to make a lwing forwards, while it is effectually oppofed, not only by all the ligaments which conneCt it at its upper part to the neighbouring bones, but alfo by the fciatic, and ifchio-facro-fciatic ligaments, which aCting upon the facrum with a lever much longer than that of the power, on account of their attachment to almoft all the lower extremity of this bone, are capable of oppofing with greater force the- fwing forwards, which the fhock, received at its upper part, tends to make it produce whence

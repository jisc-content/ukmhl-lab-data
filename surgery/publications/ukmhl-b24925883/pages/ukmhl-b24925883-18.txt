12 ON THE EFFECTS OF which it follows, that an excefs of motion is liable to inconveniences di- rectly oppofite to thofe that are the effect of its deficiency ; fuch are the dilorders arifing from the diffolution of our fluids, and the difunion of the globules that compofe them, together with the various difeafes and accidents that may fpring from this general caufe. Nature, ever attentive to the prefervation of that machine, in the conftrudtion of which fhe hath appeared to take fo much delight, haB provided for it in a manner as wife as it is admirable. Motion being the only way of preferving it, fhe hath at firft given it a primitive, effential kind of motion, diffuled throughout the whole animal oeconomy, over which the will has no power, and which can alone entertain the vital principle in man; but if he "were reftrained to this motion alone, his life, far from being a blefiing to him, would have been a fatal gift. The loco-motive faculty fubjedt to the controul of the will, comes very feafonably to the affiftance of this firft kind of motion, the effects of which it is to complete, by exalting it to that medium which can only produce the proper elaborations for the fupport of the animal oeconomy As the will is capable of putting this loco-motive faculty into adtion, it might alfo render it ufelefs ; but nature has provided againft this, by fub- mitting the animated machine to the imperious voice of want, in giving it paftions and fenfations. By thefe it is folicited, it is compelled to move, to diredl itfelf towards the objects it feels itfelf inclined to, to fearch for them, and to labour in order to procure to itfelf the enjoy- ment of them. Thus it is by the fenfe of want that nature has chofen to furnifh the machine fhe meant to pteferve, with a fupply of motion, abfolutely neceffary to maintain it in its entire ftate, during as long a continuance as it was defigned for at its firft conftrudtion. The law of labour impofed upon us by the Author of nature, was therefore connedtcd with the plan of our prefervation ; and that we might not infringe this law, he has made labour abiolutely neceffary for us. Unhappy are they who attempt to elude it ! The numberlefs dif- eafes they are afflidted with, and which are the charadteriftic of a life reduced

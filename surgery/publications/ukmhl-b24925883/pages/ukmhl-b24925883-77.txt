7* NOTES BY T H E AUTHOR, L i ter mined' arrangement and adhefion of the nutritive particles nature hag brought there for the formation of the fear, ft) It is however to be prefumed, that when fiftulous openings extend underneath aponeurofes fo ftrong and fo tenfe, as the fafeia lata, com- preffions can fcarce ever be made, fo powerful and fo exad as to effedthe propofed union throughout the whole extent of the fmus. (u) If the fiftulous opening be produced by a deep-feated caries, it will be readily conceived, that any compreffion which fhould re-unitc the finus, before the caries were cured, would prove both ufelefs and perÂ° nicious. (w) In the memoir referred to above, and which I had not quoted, left I fhould have been difeovered, it may be feen, how much I infift upon reft, as a mean of cure in moft diforders that are the effed of counter-ftrokes in the joints, extenfion of the ligamentous parts, &c. (x) The fame memoir above quoted, in reprefenting thefe different ac- cidents as the natural confequence of counter-ftrokes in thefe parts, proves alfo, that reft is the method of cure chiefly pointed out in thefe cafes. We may even conceive that the prefeription of that, as well as of motion, is as much the province of the phyfician as of the furgeon ; and that it would be rendering a very important fervice to the art of healing, to ex- plain the indications which fhould lead us, -either to preferibe or forbid the ufe of thefe two means, in difeafes which are more properly belong- ing to medicine; for it mu ft be acknowledged, they are too indiferimi- nately ordered in the cure of internal complaints. I have feveral fads by me which prove, that exercife, and pretty ftrong exertions of motion, have been very indifcreetly recommended in cafes which, had they been properly diftinguifhed, ought to have direded the exclufion of this kind of remedy, the effed of which could not but be, as it proved, very pre- judicial ; and I have other inftances, in which reft has been preferibed from fallacious indications, which, if better uaderftood, fhould have de-

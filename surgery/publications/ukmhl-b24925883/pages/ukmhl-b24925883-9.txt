3 MOTION A ND REST. fefles in itfeif this property of motion j that is fire ; ail the reft are in a ftate of inactivity. - This active principle, united to fome of our fluids, conveys motion into the machine, and tranfmits it by means of organs appropriated to this effeCt Thefe organs are the mufcles, of which there are two kinds ; fome which are not fubjeCt to the controul of the will, and whofe motion begun at the firft moment of existence, is uninterruptedly continued to its end; fuch are the heart, the arteries, the ftomach, the intek fines, &c. There are others whofe motion is fubjeCt to the will, and which ceafe to act whenever they are not determined by that principle, either for the wants or pleafures of the individual; fuch are the mufcles deftined for the motion of fome of the parts of the human body, and employed in conveying us from one place to another. This divifion determines two kinds of motion, which are diftinguifhed from each other by very palpable lines of feparation. â€”- The one is em- ployed in entertaining the vital principle, the other does no more than, fupply its exigencies and its pleafures ; a difference fo remarkable, that it neceiTarily implies one in the fource from whence thefe motions are de- rived. The nerves are the vifible canals through which the aClive fluid we attri- bute thefe two kinds of motion to, is conveyed throughout the whole extent of the animal oeconomy. Their origin is well known : they are all derived from the organs contained within the cavity of the fkull; and amidft the numerous canals which take their rife from the medullary fub- ftance of the brain and cerebellum, we may diftinguilh thofe which are difti'ibutcd to thofe important organs whofe addon, independent of the will, is abiolutely eflential to life ; thefe are particularly the intercoftal nerve and the eighth pair, which evidently arife from theiproceilus annu- laris, or Pons Varoliri3), formed, as it feems, by the union of the pedun- cles of the cerebellum, while no part of the medullary fubftance of the brain feems to enter into its competition, The nerve:, on the contrary, i which

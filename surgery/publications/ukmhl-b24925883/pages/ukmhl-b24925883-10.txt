ON THE EFFECTS OF 4 which are diftributed to organs defined to lefs important fun<ftions ; to fuch, for inftance, whofe province it is to direct our loco-motive powers, fubjedt to the controul of the will; thefe, I fay, are all derived from the medullary fubftance of the brain, or from the fpinal marrow which is the continuation of it. From this obfervation we may be convinced that the fluid feparated by the cerebellum is of a fuperior quality to that furnifhed by the brain, and that the functions of the firft of thefe organs, are infinitely more im- portant than thofe which are afligned to the latter. This fuperiority feems to be indicated by nature in the precautions fhe has taken to fecure the cerebellum from external injuries. The brain, it is true, is likewife protected from them ; but the anxiety of nature in her precautions to pre- vent the injuries the brain might be expofed to, are infinitely lefs remark- able than thofe fhe has employed in fheltering the cerebellum from any hurt that might befall it from without. In faÂ£t, the fituation of the ca- vities occupied by the cerebellum, the thicknefs of the occipital bone, in thofe parts where external fhocks might take place, the quantity of muf- cles that furround that part of the bafis of the fkull where the bone is thinneft, the tentorium which covers the cerebellum, and prevents it from fuffering compreffion from the pofterior lobes of the brain ; the conftruftion of this tentorium, made with a fagacity which cannot be fufficiently admired; the fpeedy death which is the confequence of wounds inflicfted on the cerebellum, while very material wounds of the brain are fometimes not mortal ; all thefe circumftances, I fay, contri- bute to give the ftrongeft degree of evidence to the fuperiority . we have eftablifhed. But the brain and the cerebellum are not the only preparers of animal fpirits ; we find other organs in the cavity of the fkull, which leave us no room to doubt, that in her preparation of the nervous fluid, nature hath eftablifhed a difference relative to rhe end fhe means to accomplifh. The corpora flriata, for inftance, placed in the midft of the brain, are they not particular organs which difplay the whole apparatus for fecre- tion ;

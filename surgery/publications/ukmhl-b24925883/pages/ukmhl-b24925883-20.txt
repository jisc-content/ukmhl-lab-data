ON THE EFFECTS OF 6 employed 1+ culty, which being fometimes exerted, and fometimes fufpended, be- comes the eflential regulator. What motion has deftroyed or corrupted, is repaired by reft, and the diforders which may be occafioned by a too long continuance of reft are relieved by motion. It is during the inter- vals of inaction, or oft'fleep, which neceflarily fucceeds to labour, that the vital fluid, exhaufted or corrupted by the efFe&s of motion, is repaired and reftored after all its lofl'es; and that the liquids, too much agitated and attenuated by mufcular action long continued, refume their former degree of conftftence. From motion carried beyond the degree required, there muft follow a diflolution, or a premature decompofition of the hu- mours neceflary for the fupport of the animal oeconomy ; and from ex- cefs of reft they muft become too much thickened. Some reflections and faCls will give the higheft degree of evidence to thefe two aflfertions. While motion, by the combination of its two kinds above mentioned, is kept in its due medium, the repairing materials conveyed every day into the general courfe of the circulation, are not more agitated and at- tenuated than they fliould be to unite themfelves with others fimilar to them, and to be conveyed with thefe to the parts where they are to be employed. They do not mix or contrad: adhefions with materials of a different kind, except as far as is neceflary to accomplifti any views na- ture may have in bringing about fuch combinations. Each of thefe ma- terials, which hath not contracted any improper connection, is readily and eafily admitted into the ftrainers deftined to receive it ; all the fecre- tions are properly carried on, and harmony reigns throughout the ma- chine. It is in this ftate of health, or of moderate motion which conftitutes it, that fome part of the fat and oily fubftances conveyed by the primary fluid, is continually depoftted in particular divilions of the cellular fub- ftance, to form and keep up what we call a natural plumpnefs -^). It fhould feem indeed, when motion is carried beyond this medium, that the repairing materials, undergoing a more powerful trituration, ought looner to acquire that degree of elaboration which makes them fit to be

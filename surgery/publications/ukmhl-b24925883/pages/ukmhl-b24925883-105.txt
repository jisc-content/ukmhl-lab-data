99 COUNTER-STROKES. The cartilages with which the articulating furfaces of the bones of the foot and leg are covered, deftroy alfo a part of this motion, fo that it is much weakened when fent away from thence, or when we confider it at the articulation of the leg with the thigh ; where the cartilages covering the extremities of thefe bones, and the intermediate femilunar cartilages, evidently concur in the fame effedt. Hence it may be concluded, that the motion communicated to the upper parts refting upon the thigh, hath already loft much of its force, when we confider it in the articulation of the thigh with the os innominatum, where we meet with frefh cartilages, which abforb ftill more of the motion. But the circumftance which ab- forbs the moft of it in this place, is the obliquity with which the head of the thigh bone bears upon its neck ; for by means of this difpofition, the two ofta innominata, by the quantity of motion ftill remaining in the upper parts, prefs upon each other forwards at the fymphifis of the pubis, and laterally upon the os facrum, at the point of their articulation with this bone. Now, we know, that at thefe points of union, there are fome very thick cartilages; and by tracing the motion along the fpinal column, we obferve with what art nature hath articulated and arranged the pieces which compofe it, to diminifh the violence of this motion ; fo that we are no longer furprized, that the motion of fo large a mafs as the human body, accelerated even during the time of a fall from a confiderable height, fhould be reduced almoft to nothing, when tranfmitted to the brain, by the refiftance which the feet have met with. We are not to fuppofe, however, that the cartilages of the joints, the ligaments that furround them, and the motion of the bones over each other, are the only circumftances that concur in this matter ; the mufcles have alfo their fhare in deftroying the motion of the upper parts over the lower ones, ftriking againft the ground : for notwithftanding the admi- rable arrangement of the pieces that compofe the fpine, the brain would receive, in the moft common leaps, a commotion fufEcieut to dif- lurb its organization, if, at the inftant of the fhock, the motion were conveyed in fuch a direction, as that the trunk and extremities fhould be in a ftraight line; but. fortunately this is a circumftance which

COUNTER-STROKES, 105 counter-drokes in the joint : if the foot be twided ever fo little to one fide, there will be, an extenfion of the ligaments on the oppofite fide ; there will be, what is called a wrench, and this accident can at mod only be reckoned an effect of the counter-flroke taken in its mod extenfive fenfe: the curative indications are, however, the fame as thole which have been jud mentioned. I fhall only obferve, that whenever, notwithdanding the ufe of thefe means, there fhall remain, after the lhock in the joint with extenfion and bruife of the ligaments, a permanent dififnefs and fwelling of the furrounding parts, oily and mucilaginous liniments, fuch as thofe of the unguentum althceae, animated however with a fmall quantity of brandy, may be tried with effect ; or liniments made with the marrow of animals, quickened alfo with the addition of fome fpirituous topic.

Let the joint be furrounded with a bag full of plaider of Paris in powder, to which a fourth part of fea fait and of lalt ammoniac mud be added, taking care to heat the bag before its application, which mud be frequently renewed. 1 have alfo employed with effedf, a cataplafm made with the pulp of the roots of the confolida major, mixt up with honey, in equal parts, and fpread upon tow. What is here prelcribed for the ancle joint, is equally pro- per for the other parts of the body, whenever the effedls of counter-drokes fhall leave fymptoms behind them which may require the ufe of fuch means.

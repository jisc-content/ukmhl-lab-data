MOTION AND REST. if threaten it. This circumftance can only render the ufe of motion more painful and more difficult ; but by perfevering in the ule of it, and by combining it with that of diluting and relaxing applications, calculated to diminiffi the force of the p refill re of the articular furfaces one again ft another, we fhall at length fucceed, if not in levelling entirely the bony projection, at leaf! in rendering it fo fmooth and poll died that the motion of the joint fhall no longer be impeded by it. What is thus dictated to us by reafon, 1 have obferved more than once confirmed in fradlures of the olecranon, which is evidently adapted to the articulation of the arm with the fore-arm. If an anchylofis be fre- quently the confequence of this accident, this is lefs to be afcribed to the nature of the fraCture, than to the want of (kill in thofe who treat it. It is true, that if, in this cafe, we put the fore-arm in a bent fitua- tion, and in a fling, the olecranon being then fixed by the extenfor muf- cles that are inferted into it, while the reft of the cubitus forms a right angle with the humerus, there will neceflarily remain a confiderable in- terval between the two fractured pieces. In thefe cafes, the exfudation from the fraCtured lurfaces being difcharged into the cavity of the arti- culation, and afterwards confolidated there, would, from this reafon alone, deftroy the power of its motion ; but even if this exfudation, without ftretching into the cavity of the joint, fliould only fill up the fpace between the cubitus and its apophvfis, and that fimply by mould- ing itfelf on the correfpondent part of the humerus, the anchylofis would no lefs be the neceflary confequence of an addition that fhould have lengthened the natural unciform procefs formed by the olecranon ; for the extremity of this procefs, refting then upon the bottom of the ca- vity that is found in the pofterior part of the humerus, we never can hope to make any extenfion of the fore-arm,' and it muft therefore ne- ceflarily remain in the ftate of fleCtion in which it hath been placed^; but if, inftead of ufing this manoeuvre, fo oppofite to all the rules of art and of common fenfe, we keep as much as poffible the fractured parts in a ftate of approximation, by a conftant and moderate extenfion of the fore- arm^, and by a fuitable bandage, then the exfudation which proceeds from 4 the \

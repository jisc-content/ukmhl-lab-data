liq COUNTER-STROKES. vfved' the operation ten months ; and upon examining the part, the head of the thigh bone was found completely foldered with its articular ca- vity ; each of them prel'enting alternate afperities and cavities, which formed reciprocal indentations, as was evident, in feparating this con- nexion by force. I fhall farther obferve, in this refpeci, that the thigh bone was anchylofed at a right angle with the trunk ; a circumhance which had undoubtedly proceeded from the fituation. of the patient, whofe head and trunk had been always much raifed. I could adduce fe- veral other in fiances of fimilar difeafes of the joint of the thigh with the- os innominatum, which had been the confequence of falls, either on the feet, or on the great trochanter, if thele inflances could give us any bet- ter information refpeXing the treatment neceffary to be followed in l'uch cafes : the account of mifchiefs that have been obferved, is undoubtedly ufeful, inafmuch as it may fuggeff a rational and more certain plan of cure. But there is no need here of a greater number of faXs, to deter- mine the curative method to be purfued, in all circumftances analogous to thofe which 1 have juft fubmitted to the confideration of the Academy. â€˜ > i When once we are acquainted with the mechanifm of the counter- ftrokes which the inlide of the cotyloide cavity may experience ; when we know the direction of the motion which has been impreffed on the parts by the body producing the fhock, and can eflimate nearly the quan- tity of this motion ; and when we are converfant with the nature of the different, parts which may be injured, contufed, and fqueezed by the fhock; we are then able to determine, for the cafe that prefents, a me- thod of cure founded on rational principles. Belides, the accidents which the three patients have buffered, of whofe difeafe I have given a fuccinX account,. are fully fufficient to explain the curative indications to be pur- fued in all cafes of a fimilar nature. All the mifchiefs confecutive to the counter-ftroke in the joint, when- ever it doth not produce frabture, can only proceed from the contufiom and collifion of the parts contained in it; but this collifion and contufion can only give rife to a pain more or lefs acute, to a fwelling and an in- R z flammation

MOTION AND REST. S3 But what abfolute reft and unfrequent dreftings have effe&ed in com- bination with nature in the inftances juft mentioned, they have alfo done under my inflection, in two cafes of caries of the articulation of the arm with the fore arm. One of the patients in whom this difeafe had come on after fracture, with fplinters and abfcefs in the joint, had even been fent to me in order that I might amputate the limb ; the bur- geon who had taken care of him for feveral months paft, judging there was no other way of putting a ftop to the fymptoms which attended this caries. And indeed, a very confiderable and cedematous fweliing of the elbow joint and neighbouring parts, a plentiful and offenfive di(- charge, a total lofs of appetite, a flow and luppuratory fever, two ftftu- lous openings that penetrated into the cavity of the joint, and through which a probe being introduced, diicovered a very extenfive caries, were all fymptoms fufficient to juftify the operation. Yet in this cafe, dange- rous as it was, a few months of total reft, joined to long intervals be- tween the dreftings, having aftifted the falutary formation of an anchy- lofis intended by nature, have made all the fymptoms difanpear, and have effected a perfect cure of this difeafe, with no other lofs than that of the motion of the joint. Here are already a number of faffs brought in fupport of what I have advanced, that whenever the infpifiation of any of our fluids is required in the cure of any lurgical difeale, reft muft be called in for this pur- pofe ; but there are other faffs, and of a very different kind from thofe I have here alledged, which confirm the truth of this afiertion. Wounds and ulcers, for inftance, in the cure of which reft is prefcribed with fo much efficacy, do they prefent any other indications for the employing of this method, than fuch as are derived from the neceflitv nature is un- der of giving the gelatinous liquid that oozes from their lurface a fuffi- cient degree of confiftence ? This conliftence is not only neceffary that it may be enabled to lupply, in fome fort, the place of the fkin that is deftroyed, by forming the external fear that completes the cure ; but alfo, that in the part beneath this artificial covering, it may fupply the want of the cellular fubftance, that natural connecting medium of our I parts

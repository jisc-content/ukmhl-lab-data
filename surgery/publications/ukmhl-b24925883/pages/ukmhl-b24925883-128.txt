ON THE EFFECTS OF 122 . Now we know, that when the organic ad ion of the veflels of the found bone hath accomplifhed, either in one piece, or in detached portions, the exfoliation of the bony parts that were dil'eafed, and that this exfoliation has been removed by art, or carried away by the pdwers of nature alone ; we know, I fay, that the found bony texture remaining, endeavours to unite itfelf, either to the neighbouring flefh, the nature of which it hath almoft adopted, or to other bony portions which may have undergone the fame changes. It is therefore no way furprizing, according to the pre- ceding obfervation, that the whole furface of the head of the thigh bone, and of the cavity which received it, having exfoliated by degrees, and the fragments of this exfoliation having been continually carried away by the difeharge, thefe furfaces fhould have been foldered together, fo as to make but one common bone. Would it have been more furprizing if this great efFed had been accomplifhed without the dcflrudion of the patient ? Can we be certain that the patient, from his conftitution, was in circumfiances the moft favourable for the luccels of the event ? Can we be certain, in a word, that the operations of nature, as well as thole of art, had not been counteracted by imprudent motions, as much du- ring the three years that this man, who w'as very poor, languifhed at home, as during the ten months he lived in the Holpital: Difeafes of this nature do not therefore feem to me entirely beyond the reach of art. The long fpace of time the patient lived after the evacua- tion of the pus by the hflulous openings, compared to the time tliofe pa- tients lived, in whom large incilions were made to procure this evacua- tion, feems, in fome meafure, to indicate the proper mode of proceeding in fuch cafes. From tills inftance, and others, which I cannot quote upon this occafion, becaufe they have no connedion with the queflion of counter-firokes, I fhould imagine, that when the original accidents have unfortunately failed of effedual relief, and that an abfcels has been formed in the joint, which fhall have manifefled itfelf externally by evi- dent figns ; I fhould imagine, 1 fry, that we fhould not be in hafle to give vent to it; and if it fhould be thought indifpenfably neceffary to let out the pus, this fhould only be done by pundure with a trocar.

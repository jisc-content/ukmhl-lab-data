6 ' ON THE EFFECTS Of fluid of the third pair, and with motions of expreflion which certainly require fluids derived from other lources. It is for this reafon we fee that the fourth pair, a fmall nervous filament, goes to receive the fluid it is to convey to the external oblique mufcle of the eye, from the pofte- rior and inferior part of the tuberculi quadrigemini (s) The fame thing may be obferved of the branch of the flxth pair which goes to the abduc- tor, and whofe origin is at the Pons Varolii. Had the globe of the eye wanted nothing more than a change of pofi- tion, the third pair fupplies it with filaments of a fufficient fize to have produced this effect for as long a continuance, and as frequently as the functions of this organ might require, or otberwife this third pair would have been made more conflderable at the expence of the large medullary mafs of the brain ; but the fluid fupplied by this pair could not, proba- bly, in many circumftances, have anfwered all the defigns of nature for want of fufficient activity and energy. Love, anger, joy, lorrow, pride, and contempt, which are fo ftrongly exprefled by the eye, that it is with reafon confidered as the mirror of the foul, are undoubtedly afteftions which cannot be exprefled by the powers of that grofler fluid which is fecreted from the great refervoir. It is true, that the two laid: branches of the fifth pair of nerves, as well as its ophthalmic branch which contributes to form the intercoftal nerve, the remainder of the flxth pair which has not been employed in this foundation, and the feventh pair, derive the fluid they are deflined to convey, from the medullary fubftance of the cerebellum, in common with the intercoftal nerve and the eighth pair. But although the func- tions of the parts on which they are beftowed, do not immediately feem of fo great importance as thofe of the parts to which the intercoftal nerve and the eighth pair are diftributed, yet it is no lefs certain that the cefla- tion of their adftion would very foon be followed by death. Were the fecretion of the falivary fluid, were maftication, or degluti- tion, interrupted for a certain fpace of time, in vain would the heart, the lungs,

ON THE EFFECTS OF COUNTER-STROKES. 160 the injury hath happened in the vifcera contained in the fcveral cavities, the brain itfelf not excepted. Accordingly, we find, that in all thefe cafes, repeated bleedings, perfect reft, and ftri<5t diet, are the remedies to be preferred (ZK External applications in cafes where they can be em- ployed, are only acceflory remedies, which however are not to be neg- lected ; they muft only be varied according to circumftances. Some- times they are only to be fuch as to defend the parts, at other times, re- folutive fpirituous topics are to be applied ; fometimes emollient, relax- ing and anodine remedies ; fometimes faponaceous, balfamic, aftringent aromatics, tonics, and artificial pumping upon the part, with natural or artificial medicinal waters, &c. Thefe are all fubordinate methods, to which we are fometimes the more obliged to have recourle, the more we have neglected, in the firft inftance, the principal modes of cure which we have treated of. A fubjeft fo difficult, and fo extensive, required more genius to be well underftood, more talents and knowledge to be treated to the fatisfaClion of the Academy. I have at leaft exerted my beft endeavours to fulfill the conditions of the thefts ; and can only judge of my efforts, without being anfwerable for the fuccefs of them ; nor fhall 1 think my labours ufelefs, if they can only intitlc me to fome attention from thole who arc to decide upon them.

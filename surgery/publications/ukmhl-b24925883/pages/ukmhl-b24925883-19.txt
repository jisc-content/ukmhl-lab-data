MOTION AND REST. i *3 reduced within narrower bounds expofe them to a very fevere penalty for the infringement of this facred law. But this fecondary motion, fubjedt to the controul of the will, and which comes fo feafonably to the affiftance of the firft in perfecting the functions of the animal (economy, may deprave them when it is carried to excefs ; it might even deftroy them very fpeedily, had it no other re- ftraint befdes that of the will. For the imperious will, folicited by paf- fions it is eager to gratify, and ever intent upon its objeCt, would foon carry to excefs the motion which is fubordinate to it, and would imper- ceptibly flrike the fatal blow to that machine for the prefervation of which it was inftituted. But here again nature, as in every other inftance, has been watchful to prevent the ahufe ; for, after motions too violent, or too long con- tinued, fhe hath made the powers that execute them, difobedient to the call of the will. A kind of palfy, the effeCt of the animal fpirits being exhaufted, follows the too forcible exertion of the mufcles, and makes reft neceffary. Reft may be compleat or incompleat ; compleat, when the loco-motive faculty feems to be in a perfeCt ftate of annihilation, and that the organs of the fenl'es require to be excited by a ftimulus more powerful than ufual, from the fubftances which ought to affeCl them ; this it is that conftitutes fleep : incompleat, when the organs of the fen- fes, reftored, at the time of waking, to their natural fenfibility, the loco- motive faculty, without being exerted, may be put into aCtion by the flighted impulfe of the will. This incompleat kind of reft is divided into general and partial; general, when this faculty is not exerted on any of the parts of the machine ; partial, when it is put into aCtion, to move only fome of its parts. Reft, as we fee, is fufceptible of many degrees, and hath advantages as real and as efficacious as thofe that refult from motion. Reft is, in- deed, the regulator of motion, and is intended to keep it in that ftate of equilibrium which conftitutes health ; or rather it is the loco-motive fa- D culty,

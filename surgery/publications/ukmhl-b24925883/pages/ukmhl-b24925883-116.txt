ON THE EFFECTS OF the TIO With refpeCt to'Ample and compound fraCturcs of the leg, they arc moft commonly the cffeCt of counter-ltrokes, (nice all thofe which hap- pen in the inflance of falls, are feldom the relult of a blow immediately applied to the part of the bone that gives way. But as they require no other treatment than that which is equally applicable to fractures in ge- neral, I fhall proceed immediately to conlider the effects of counter- ftrokes on the joint of the knee. Although this joint may fometimes be expofed to the effeCts of counter- ftrokes, it mud however be acknowledged, that, in cafes of falls on the feet, the great furface by which-the os femoris and the tibia are in con- tact with each other, and the intervening cartilage which is met with in the joint between thefe two bones, are contrivances well calculated to elude the effects of counter-drokes which the joint might differ. The circumdance which renders thefe effeCts lefs frequent, and lefs to be ap- prehended,' is, that the (hock muft be very violent in order to produce any mifehief; and this could not be in the indance of leaps, or falls on the feet, ualefs the whole weight of the trunk bore directly upon the articulating furfaces of the tibia ; that is to fay, unlefs the thighs and the trunk, at die inftant of the fhock, fhould maintain that rectilinear pofition which would make the line of gravity of the upper parts hear upon the articulating furfaces of that bone. It is evident that l'ucli a pofition mud be very difficult in a part which has fo many joints and bendings as the trunk, and the inflections of which depend upon fuch an infinite number of mufcles. But ftippofing even this pofition to exift, the effeCts of it would not be felt in the knee joint; they would rather take place in the articulation of the thigh with the os innominatum : the head of the thigh bone might be feparated, and its neck fraCturcd, on account of the oblique direction with which the weight of the body bears upon thefe parts ; or if the fhock were not violent enough to pro- duce fuch effeCts, it might occafion a contufion in this joint. It might even happen, from the pofition above fuppofed, that the motion of the head upon the fpinal column being fuddenly /topped, might occafion a mortal commotion in the brain, even in thofe cales where the /hock of

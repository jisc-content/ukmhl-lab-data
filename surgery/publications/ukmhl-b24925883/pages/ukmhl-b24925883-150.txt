ON THE EFFECTS OF 6 then M+ the proceffus acromion of the fcapula, is fometimes produced : the fol- lowing is an inftaucc of i:. In 1769, a man cairying a condderable load upon iiis left fhoulder, having fallen upon the right elbow, or rather upon the upper part of the fore arm, while bent at right angles with the upper arm ; the head of the os brachii was driven with fo much force ngainft the acromion, that the procefs was fractured, while I perceived only a flight contufion at the part which had received the fhock. It does not appear to me, that the mechanifm of fuch a fradhire ought to make any alteration in the method of cure which it requires of itfelf. I11 what- ever manner the caul'e producing the fradlure may have adted, the bufinefs is to bring the fradtured extremities into exact appofition, and to maintain them in a ftate of reft, which may allow of the infpiffation of the inter- mediate juice that is to unite them. This double intention may be fulfilled, by keeping the arm exadlly fixed to the trunk, and fupporting it in fuch a manner, that the head of the os brachii (hall be conftantly kept clofe to the acromion, the motion of which is afterwards to be reftrained, as well as that of the fcapula and clavicle, by fuitable comprefles, and by the capeline of the fcapula, which is to be applied, as I have juft before mentioned, fo as to include the arm in the circular turns which this bandage makes round the body ; the cure will be the more complete in proportion as the motion of all thefe parts fhall have been more confined. For this real'on, in order more effectually to anfwer this eflfential indication, we mull till up, with lint or cotton dipt in the mixture above mentioned, all the hollows on the fore part of the arm, above and below the clavicle, &c. and this before we apply the roller. Thefe were nearly the modes of proceeding I adopted in the cafe juft mentioned, and which fucceededjfo well, that the patient enjoyed, a few months after, a greater freedom of motion than I expected, confidering what authors have laid ot this fracture. / But fuppofing that the direction of a violent flaock flaould be fuch, that the os brachii fhall not fuller any fracture either in its body, or at its ucck, and that it fhall not be driven again ft the acton im, the fhock h

54 ON THE EFFECTS OF pirts, which lus been deftroyed by the fuppuration. For we are not to imagine that the gelatinous concretion which we obferve in fears, is con- fined to what we fee of it outwardly. Motion, far from a (Tiffing in this good effect, cannot but prevent it, by deftroying the adhefions already begun underneath the part where the fear is to be made, bv putting an impediment to the necefliiry concretion of the gelatinous fluids that are to form it, and even by deffroying it when it has not acquired its utmofl degree of folidity, as we are taught by experience, particularly in the cure of ulcers of the legs. Here the indication for reff to the part af- fected is fo pofitive, that they never can be firmly healed without the help of this method, and that excefs of motion alone, without the con- currence of any other circumftance, often makes them burft out again after they have been completely healed. From hence it may be concluded, that we muff be careful to preferibe reft for the part affedted, during the cure of wounds and ulcers (^. This attention muff even be continued beyond the time of the complete formation of the fear, in cafes where the mufcular parts underneath it are expol'ed to frequent motion ; and it muff be carried fiill farther when thefe fame parts have been affeCled by the difeafe, becaule the gluten, fupplying the place of the cellular lubftance which connected the muf- cular fibres, may not have acquired at firft a fufficient degree of confid- ence, to refifl: the efforts it muff then be expofed to by a ftrong contrac- tion of thefe parts. The following faÂ£t will evidently prove how ufeful fuch a precaution is in this laft circumftance. A Journeyman Taylor, after having had an abfeefs by congeftion, came to me in 1776 with a fiftulous opening, which wras already of lome continuance in the upper, external, and rather pofterior part of the thigh, about two inches below the great trochanter. I pafled a probe into the fiftula, which furnifhed a large quantity of ferous, and l'omewhat foetid, difeharge, and found that it pafled under the external and anterior rnufcles of the thigh ,pretty near the bone, and that it extended about fix inches beyond its external opening, taking its courfe towards the joint.

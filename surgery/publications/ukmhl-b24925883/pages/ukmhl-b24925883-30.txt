*4 ON THE EFFECTS OF tirely by very powerful and long-continued exercife, which putting the part affected in adtion, produces in it a falutary agitation and attenua- tion of the humours forming the painful obftrudtion(,2). Even in tliofe cafes where the pains are too violent, and mul'cular adtion too much be- numbed to admit of vigorous motion in the part affected, the heft cura- tive means are {fill to be chofen from among thofe that Simulate the l'o- lids and fluids of the part. Thefe are, either warm or cold bathing, which, befides facilitating the attenuation of the humours by the introduction of aqueous particles that may poffibly be conveyed fo as to mix with them, do alfo excite motion in them ; cold baths, by incrca- fing the tone of the folids; warm ones, by the rarefaction they produce in the fluids. Stupes add to thefe effects, already fo efficacious in tliem- l'elves, the power of breaking mechanically the inlpiffated juices by the fhocks and ftrokes they carry along with them. The juices are, as it were, kneaded by this agent, which from its foft, mild, and uniform method of adting, is much to be preferred to the other external methods em- ployed to produce this effedt ; fuch, for inftance, as dry frictions upon the parr, flagellation with nettles, &c. â€” If thele kinds of means are fometimes attended with fuccefs, it is evident this rnuft happen by their conveying into the painful part a degree of motion fit to attenuate the humours that formed the obftrudlion, and induce them to a change of place. This reafoning may be extended to thofe large bliflers lucccls- fully applied to limbs affedted with the rheumatifm ; it is as much by the motion they excite in the part, as by the difeharge of ferum, and the luppuration they occalion, that they produce thofe lalutary efFedts they are often attended with. An anchvlofis appears to be nothing more titan a gradual infpiflation of the fynovia, by which, bones originally defigned to move freely upon one another, become conlolidatcd. The curative indication that prefents itfelf here is to counteract this infpiflation while it is forming, and to reflore the fynovia to its firft ftate of fluidity, when it hath acquired a preternatural confidence which confines and even delfroys the motions it was deflated to facilitate : but what are the means by which this indi- cation

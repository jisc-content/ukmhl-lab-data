ON THE EFFECTS O- F *<c tipiy his poinrs of contadl with the ground; if forwards, he prefcnts his hands and knees for the lame purpofe; and if fideways, the elbow. Thus it is that we i.nftindtively avoid the commotion of the brain or the fracture of the cranium ; but nature very frequently can only ward ofF thefe accidents, at the expence of the parts of lei's conlequence, which feem fo voluntarily to offer thcmfelves for the prefervation of this im- portant vifeus. Accordingly, we have already feen what the lower ex- tremities are expofed to lutfer, in many cafes, in taking their fharc of this prefervative intention d/> ; and it is in endeavouring to accomplilh the fame end, that we lhall find the upper extremities alio expofed to injuries which are almoft always the effect of a counter-Hroke. If the palms of the hands ftrike upon the ground in any fall whatever, thefe parts being fuddenly flopped, the body is Hopped at the fame time ; and the bones which compofe them receive the Ihock of the upper extre- mity, which is itfelf a died upon by part of the trunk in motion. This kind of Ihock, which is a real counter-ftroke, may, and fometimes does, produce mifehiefs in the joint, a divulfion of the ligaments which connect the neighbouring bones, or a dillocation of the wrilt; which lalt accident belongs to the effedts of counter-ftrokes taken in the molt extenfive fenfe. It may however be obferved, that fome of thele injuries are lefs frequent than they might be fuppofed to be, and that for reafons which are de- rived from the mechanifm of the fall. The diredtion of the motion being then in a midway between the vertical and the horizontal line, the bones of the carpus are always pulhed diredtly againlt the bones of the fore arm, and this fame diredtion farther eludes the violence of the Ihock, inaf- much as the hands being able to Hide on a little forwards, the motion is not fo fuddenly Hopped as it would have been without this circumftance. But notwithflanding this, and the loofe attachment of the lcapula, which renders the application of the weight of the trunk gradual, a fall upon the hands will not unfrequently occaHon, in the joint of the wriH, the injuries 1 have been mentioning.

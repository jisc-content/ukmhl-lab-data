128 ON THE EFFECTS OF nothing more than a dull pain about the region of the os facrum, to- wards the right fide ; the pain increafed, and on the fifty fifth day the difficulty of walking was fo eonfiderable, that he could not do it without a flick ; urged by his complaint, which now began to make him uneafv, he applied for affiflance. Having a flight degree of fever, he was blood- ed ; refl, and the ule of refolutive fomentations, were prel'cribed to him ; and laflly, embrocations made with the martiatum and oil of nutmegs, animated with fait ammoniac ; but this was without any fuccefs, the period of the efficacy of thefe means being pafled. The complaint con- tinued increafing for five months, at the expiration of which, the patient could not bear in the leaft upon the right limb ; the motion of bending the thigh upon the trunk was both extremely painful and difficult ; and a tumour began to manifeft itfeif, which came from under Poupartâ€™s ligament.

The pus, which had been at firft white, and devoid of fmell, having become thin and very offenfive, vulnerary, deterfive and fpirituous lotions, were injeCted into the abfeefs ; and the dreflings and injections were more frequently repeated ; but all thefe precautions were fruitlefs, the fever increafed with the putrefaction, and the patient died on the ninth day after the opening. Upon examining the body, all the upper and lateral portion of the facrum on the right fide was found carious, as well as the correfponding part

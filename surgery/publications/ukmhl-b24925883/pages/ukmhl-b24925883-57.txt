MOTION AND REST. 5* in hofpitals for feveral years, and had frequently brought him into a very dangerous ftate. His thigh, which forms almoft a right angle with the trunk, being evidently much fhorter than the other, there is no reafon to doubt that this effect has been produced by the deftru&ion of the head of the thigh bone, by a caries which nature mud have fucceeded in the cure of, by following the track I have juft been defcribing. But what I have not had an opportunity of obferving myfelf with re- fpeCt to the articulation of the thigh with the os innominatum , I have obferved in articulations of the thigh with the leg, and of the leg with the foot. I have feen in thefe joints, ablcefles attended with caries, which after having made for themfelves, in a long courfe of time, fiftu- lous openings, and after having furnifhed, for years, a difcharge more or lefs plentiful, have at length ceafed to luppurate ; and have left nothing more than a complete union of the articulating furfaces that had been deftroyed. But thefe great cures have all been owing to nature, and art has concurred in them no farther than in preventing every kind of mo- tion, every change of pofture, which might keep up the irritation of the parts affeCted Drefiings feldom, very feldom renewed, and an at- tention to place the limbs at reft between junks, as in fraCtures, have been the only means employed^. I might poftibly have obtained the fame termination in a caries, with an abfcefs, in the articulation of the os humeri with the fcapula, had I not yielded to the temptation of giving vent to a large collection of mat- ter that began to Ihew itfelf by an evident fluctuation. But at that time 1 had not been fufflciently informed by my own miftakes. The event was fatal to the patient, who died of a luppuratory fever, after having fallen into a marafmus ; and though on examining the part, I found a ca- ries of the head of the os humeri, and of the glenoide cavity of the fca- pula, a difeafe hitherto deemed incurable, I have not been the lefs per- luaded fince, that the operation I had performed, if it had not imme- diately caufed, had at leaft haftened the death of him whom it had been . intended

iS MOTION AND REST. employed in repairing the machine ; but, on the contrary, exceffive mo- tion dedroys this ufeful end, by forming between thefe materials that are of a different nature, cohefions and connexions which prevent them from being depofited in a fufficient proportion for the fupport of the ma- chine ; and fuch of them as may be depolited in a fufficient propor- tion, will too foon have attained that period which requires their being replaced. In this date of exceffive motion, which difeovers, at leaf!:, a kind of diffolution in our juices, the oily part of the blood is either depofited in a very fmall quantity in the adipofe cells, or is perpetually re-abforbed into the general courfe of the circulation, either to avoid the pernicious effeXs of too great a friXion, or, in mixing, by the means of tritura- tion, with certain depraved humours and materials, to facilitate their expulfion ; and that by reafon of its oily fmooth particles, which pre- vent the corrugation and contraXion of the drainers through which thefe corrupted juices mud pafs. Thus we fee that leannefs is ufually the attendant of exceffive labour ; the continuance of it would necedarily bring on a complete diffolution of our juices ; but nature has put infur- mountable obdacles to this fatal effeX ; to wit, laffitude, and deep which fucceeds to it. During the latter, which is an image of the mod per- feX date of red, the mafs of humours, being only affeXed by that mo- tion which is produced by the aXion of organs not fubjeX to the will, the particles of fimilar materials, diffufed throughout this mafs and which have experienced a kind of feparation, are endeavouring to re- unite themfelves, and to contraX a new degree of coherence that may enable them to fudain the efforts of that motion which mud increafe at the time of waking. Frefh food, by furnifhing recruits of crude and glutinous materials, contributes to drengthen this falutary cohefion, and to weaken the pernicious effeXs of motion too long continued. It is fo true that red increafes the confidence of our juices, that when it is exceffive, by carrying this confidence too far, it produces evident marks of infpidation in lome of our humours.

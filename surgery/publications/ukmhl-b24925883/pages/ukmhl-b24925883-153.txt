COUNTER-STROKES. i47 ftroke, the effects of counter-ftrokes on the external parts will be con-' fiderably increafed ; for in this general acceptation, diflocations are always produced by this caufe. We cannot doubt of this, when we fee that a diflocation of the thigh is almoft always the refult of a fhock, of a refif- tance, or of a power applied towards the lower extremity of that bone ; the fame may be faid of a luxation of the wrift, of the elbow, of the fhoulder, of the clavicle, of the lower jaw, of the leg, &c. The bone always receives the ftroke either at the extremity oppofite to that which is dillocated, or in its body : there are even few inftances where the fhock applied immediately to the joint, could poffibly produce the kinds of accidents we have been {peaking of In making this obfervation, I do not mean to explain the mechanifm by which diflocations are produced; this is a point which it was impoflible ever to miftake ; we only give the name of counter-ftroke to this mechanifm, without making any addition to the well-known theory of thefe accidents ; nor does this bring any improvement in the mode of treatment required for luxations. It is well known what proceedings are to be adopted in all cafes of this kind, either to accomplifh the reduction of the diflocation, to maintain the parts re- duced in their fituation, or to relieve the prefent and counteract future mifchiefs. All thefe points of dodtrine have been difcufted by the mod able practitioners ; and I cannot fuppofe it to be the wifti of the Academy that we fhould take a review of all kinds of luxations, becaufe they are effects of counter-ftrokes, if even we had any interefting obfervations to offer upon feme of thefe injuries. What is here faid of difloca- tions, I alio fay of a wrench, and of a diaftaffs, which are likewife the effect of counter-ftrokes, fince the mifehief is not done to the part that receives the ftroke. With refpedt to the treatment of thefe complaints, we have nothing to propofe which is not already known. Repeated bleedings, refolutive, emollient, and fometimes fpirituous applications, re- tentive bandages, and above all things, abfolute reft, are the means to be preferred in all fuch cales ; and I only mention them here, that 1 may not be fuppofed to have overlooked this part of the effedls of counter^ ftrokes.

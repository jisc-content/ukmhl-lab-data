OX THE EFFECTS OF 34 1 have icon gonorrhoeas cpale of themfelves, and venereal buboes, abandoned totally to nature, perfedlv healed after a plentiful iuppura- tion, and the perl'ons a ill died with thele complaints have not afterwards experienced the lead venereal iymptem, though they had net made ule of any mercurial remedy. 1 have l'cen a man radically cured of the moft dangerous venereal fymptoms, for which he was intending to undergo a falivation, at the end of a putrid fever that laded forty days, and the crilis of which was obtained by very copious and long-continued lweats. Mercury and its preparations are not then the only antidote to the ve- nereal virus ; every thing that can exalt the motion of the machine to a certain pitch, and maintain it there for a fufficient time, may be ufed with effect in this cafe to redd the infpiflation of the lymph, and the caufe which produces it. Miafcular motion, as it cannot be continual, is fcarce able to have this ed'ed ; but though it may not, of itfelf, have power to dedrov the virus, it is no lels certain that it may adid in pre- venting the progrels of it. It is from oblerving its good efleds in vene- real afFedions, that I lcruple not to combine it with the ufe of mercurial medicines, which increafe internal motion. I therefore always delire my patients to ufe a great deal of exercife, while I treat them with mercu- rial fridions. Though the weather may be rather cold, I do not confine them to their rooms, and have never had any reafon to repent of this method. There have been lbme patients even, who though they went out every day, and took a long walk, morning and evening, have never had the mouth heated, notwithdanding they had uled as much as eight ounces of ointment in the ulual quantities. The feurvy not being entirely a furgical diforder, ought not, perhaps, to be noticed here ; yet let me be permitted to expole lome ot the phe- nomena this difeafe prelents us with in its various dages ; becaufe they will form, in regard to what has been laid concerning motion and its ef- feds, an additional degree of probability by which it would be difficult not to be convinced. In the fird and l'eccnd periods of this difeafe, every thing indicates too great an infpiflation in the fluids of the perl'ons who are

COUNTER-STROKES, l>3 in thefe cafes, feems to be a kind of bath for the bone, to which it owes all the advantages we have been defcribing. So little fhould we confider the pus as a noxious fluid, that, in thefe infiances, I have never found it tainted with the leaf!: fmell, even when I have let it out after the collec- tion had been formed feveral months, and in quantities fo considerable as to amount to two or three pints, among which feveral fragments of bone have been found floating. But it is neceffary to repeat, becaufe it is an inftrudtive obfervation, that in lefs than three days, when thefe abfceffes have been largely opened, the matter, which at the time of opening was always of a proper confidence and perfectly devoid of fmell, has become thin and very foetid. Perhaps by adopting the method I have propofed, with refpedt to the time and manner of opening thefe immenfe abfeefTes which are formed in confequence of violent contufions ill the joint of the hip and by making the patient abftain from all motion which might impede the operations of nature and thofe of art, the complete anchy- lofis of the articulating furfaces might be obtained, which, in the def- perate cafes we are fpeaking of, is the only refource we have to look up to. To what has been faid upon this fubjeft, I fhall add, that it would be proper to endeavour to put the lower extremity and the trunk in fuch a poftion with refpedl to each other, that after the formation of the an- chylofis, the latter fhould preferve, as much as poffible, a vertical direc- tion with the limb.

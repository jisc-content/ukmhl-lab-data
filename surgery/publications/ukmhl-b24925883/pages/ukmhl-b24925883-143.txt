COUNTER-STROKES. J37 body, no injury can be done to the fternum, nor to the anterior part of the rihs ; and then the fracture, which may happen at the part that re- ceives the blow, is no longer the effeft of a counter-ftroke. It could only be chaffed among the effefts of iuch a caufe, in thofe inftances, where it fhould happen on the fide oppofite to that which received the (hock ; which is not impoffible in the fuppofition of the trunk leaning againft fome refilling body ; and in this cafe likewife, the bell way of directing the cure is fufficiently known. With refpeft to the fternum, although from its fituation and figure it fhould not be very liable to the effects of counter-ftrokes, yet it hath fometimes happened, that a fradlure of this bone has been produced by fuch a caufe, of which the following fabt is an inflance. A mafon, eight and twenty years of age, having been brought to the hofpital, after falling from the height of about fifty feet, it was found, upon examining him, that he had a fradlure of the left thigh, and that the fpinal procefles, of the lafl of the dorfal, and firft of the lumbar ver- tebrae, were likewife broken. The fradlure of the thigh being reduced, and the furgeon perceiving that the man could not bring his head for- wards, examined in order to find out the reafon of this, and difcovered it to be a tranfverfe fradlure of the fternum, with a confiderable interval between the firft and fecond piece of that bone. The patient when on the ground, was found lying upon his back, with his left leg under him; and upon the fore-part of the breaft there was neither ecchymofis nor excoriation, nor any nfferk which could induce a fufpicion that the frac- ture of the fternum had been produced by a blow upon the part. The mechanifm of this accident, appeared therefore fo problematical to the furgeon, that he found it difficult to account for it ; but a workman who was prefent, foon enabled him to folve this difficulfv, by acquainting him, that the patient, at little more than one third of the courfe of his fall, had met with a projedling piece of fcaffolding, which had given him a blow in the middle of his back. The furgeon, as well verfed in the pradlice as in the theory of his art, immediately concluded, that the' fradlure of the lpinal proceffes of the vertebrae above mentioned, and that

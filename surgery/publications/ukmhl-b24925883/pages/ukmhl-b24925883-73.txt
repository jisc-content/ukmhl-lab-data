/ NOTES BY THE AUTHOR. 67 hehtate to confefs my miftakes. The hiftory of thefe, oftentimes proves more inftrudive to others, than that of our fuccefles. (l) The impoffibility of walking, and the neceffity of keeping in bed, which attend this difeafe, are a proof of this. (m) It is always the depraved organization of the bones that caufes the caries and the defquamations ; but this depravity may be produced, not only by the adion of fome power on the bones themlelves, but alfo by injuries afteding either the cartilages that line, or unite them ; or the ligaments which form and ftrengthen their union ; or, laftly, the periofteum which covers them : for the affedions of thefe parts which are eflential to the bones, are often tranfmitted to them, and occalion the caries.

162 AUTHOR'S NOTES contained in the cavity of the cranium, would continue to {hike a gain ft: the balls of this cavity, with all the force that would have been imparted to it, by the velocity it would have acquired in the fall. This would produce, in the organization of this important vilcus, a difturbance of the fame kind as that which wasobferved in the brain of a criminal, who, running from a few paces back, dallied his head agamft the wall of his prifon. But the cartilages which line all the joints, thofe which unite the vertebrae with each other, and efpecially the various inflexions of the body in falls upon the feet, are the caufe that the head, conjingnear the ground when thefe parts are already at reft, can only lofe its motion in a gradual and imperceptible manner. (d) I have feen patients, cured of a fradture of the fibula, remaining a long time unable to wralk without crutches. (e) This was the third death Iliad feen happen at the fame period, and with the lame fymptoms, after compound fradtures of the legs which had been well reduced ; this circumftance led me to refledt. I inquired for the limb, and examined the ftateof the tibia ; the marrow contained in the cylinder of this bone, was lomewhat in a ftateof dilfolution towards the fradhired extremities, and the fmell of it was putrid in the higheft degree. This circumftance made me imagine, that a portion of the putrid mialmata produced by the dilfolution of the marrow, having been abforbed, had o:cafioned a true nervous difeafe; and in confequence of this idea, I de- termined to adopt fome other mode of proceeding in the firft cafe of the kind which my pradtice might furnifh me with. The opportunity foou prefented itfelf; when, inftead of putting the two ends of the tibia in exa-dl apportion, I placed them in fuck a manner, that by means of their foliation, and of a detached piece of bone which 1 took away, 1 could conveniently throw into the cavity of the bone any injedlion I might think proper; lb that 1 treated ithis cafe as every compound fradture is treated, with the additional precaution only, of injedling upwards and downwards into the cavity of the bone, at every drefting. By this contri- vance, mv patient was exempt from any of thole lymptoms which had luccdiively i

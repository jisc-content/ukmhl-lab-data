ON THE EFFECTS OF 3Â° they may convey to them, are capable of fupplying the ligaments and aponeurofes, and are therefore excellent means to be employed previous to that motion which is to reflore to the joint its free play, and get the better of the anchylufis. Stiffne'fles of the joint which continue for a long time after fprains, luxations, and fractures, even at a dift.mce from the articulations, arc alio produced by an infpiflation which is the effect cither of the com- pelled flagnation of the fluids during the obftruction of the parts afiedted, or of the continued reft to which they have been confined in order to fulfil the moft urgent indications which thefe diforders prefent. In thefe cafes too, motion either alone, or combined with other auxiliary me- thods I have before mentioned, is the effectual remedy to remove thefe rigidities(,<5). In a word, whatever may be the diftant caufe from which thefe accidents may be produced, their apparent caufe confifts always in infpifl'ated juices, which cannot be reftored to their flrft ftate of fluiditv without the affiftance of motion ; either internal motion excited- by re- medies adapted to the caufe of the infpiflation, or external motion pro- duced by mufcular adtion. From the fadts already recited, which are well known to all the pro- feflion, we are fufficiently authorized to conclude, that wherever there is any difeafed infpiflation, we muft have recourfe to motion to corredt it; but other fadts will give the higheft degree of evidence to this afler- tion. Every thing perfuades us that the fcrophula, for inftance, one of thofe difeafes in which this infpiflation is moft remarkable, is produced by want of motion in the perfons who are affedted with it. Infancy, which is ufually the feafon of this difeafe, is indeed the time when motion is moft exerted in the machine ; but it is not with- out neceftity that this principle is carried fo high at this period. The nature of the food of a new-born infant, the rapid growth he is to ex- perience, the extent of furface he prefents, in proportion to his fize, to the fluid in which he lives ; all thefe circumftances require in him a 3 much

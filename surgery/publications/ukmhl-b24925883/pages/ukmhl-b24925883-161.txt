COUNTER-STROKES. 155 was reduced to fuch a ftate, that his ftomach would retain nothing but liquids; and thefe heÂ» at length became unable to pals, tor they were thrown up again in large quantities, after having remained fometimes two or three days in the ftomach. The patient fell at length into a marafmus, and died in an aftonifhing ftate of emaciation. Upon opening the bodv, 1 found the liver very hard, without being much increafed in lize ; the pancreas was fchirrhous at that part of it which is next to the duo- denum ; and this inteftine, partaking of the difeafe of the pancreas, was almoft entirely obliterated ; the ftomach was exceedingly large, and the inteftines were fcarce bigger than thole of a chicken. Befides all the pernicious effeds of counter-ftrokes upon the principal vifcera of the abdomen, how frequently has not this kind of caufe given rife to a mortal commotion in the fpinal marrow ?

With refpedt to the proper mode of treatment in the feveral cafes which we have been fpeaking of, it may be obferved, that the fymptoms which are or may be the refult of counter-ftrokes, the efFedfs of which are

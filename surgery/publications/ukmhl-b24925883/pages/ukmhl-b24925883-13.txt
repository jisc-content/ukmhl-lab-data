7 MOTION AND REST. lungs, the domach, the intedines, &c., enjoy the power of fulfilling the offices affigned to them ; the animal would foon ceafe to live. If the fmell, the fight, and the hearing, be not abfolutely eflential to life, they are, at lead, fenfations which conditute the only pleafures of our exid- ence, and the man, who fhould be deprived of them, would probably be ranked among the mod dupid animals ; it is even to be prefumed that it the deficiency of the fenfes were not then filled up by fome particular in- dinft, he would be unable to minider to his own wants, even in the midd of thofe productions which might be fufficient for the purpofe. From what has been faid, we are obliged to allow, that the fluid which makes of man a living and thinking being which renders him capable of all thofe improvements that embellifh his nature, is derived either from the medullary fubdance of the cerebellum, or from particular and very didinCt organs of the brain itfelf; and that the loco-motive faculty which completes the animal machine, by adding greatly to the pleafures of its exidence, is derived from the fluid furnifhed by the medullary fub- dance of the brain. This prefents to us two kinds of motion, as didinft from each other as the fprings from whence they are derived. One kind, which effentially conditutes life, over which the will exerts no empire, and which is produced by the fluid feparated from the cerebellum ; ano- ther kind, not of fuch abfolute neceffity, fubjeft to the controul of the will, and effeded by the fluid ieparated from the brain. Thefe preliminary notions concerning the origin and the didiindions of motion being acquired, its effefts on the animal oeconomy will more ea- fily be perceived, and the indications which direCt the ufe of it, will be more readily fuggeded. Thefe two points of difcudion form a natural divifion of this eflay into two parts. The objeft of the fird will be to demondrate the effetds of motion and red, and the fecond will difcover the indications which prefcribe the ufe of either in furgical diforders, C 2 PART

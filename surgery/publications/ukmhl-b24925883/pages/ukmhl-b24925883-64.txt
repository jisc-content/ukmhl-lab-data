ON THE EFFECTS OF 58 But if reft: of the parts concerned, be indicated in the cure of liftu- 1ns, of which there is no doubt, it fee ms not lcfs fo in the prevention of them. Abfcefles which happen in the circumference of the cheft, and which fo frequently remain fiftulous, whether they burft of themfelves, or whether they be opened by final 1 inciiions, become fo merely from the continual motion annexed to the parts in the extent of which they are formed. But there are means of reftraining this motion, and of keeping thefe parts in a ftate of reft neceffiiry to bring about their cohe- fion. A free incifion, carried even acrofs the mufcles that cover thefe ab- fcefles, openings extended according to the direction of the ftnulies they prefent, compreftions difpoled with fkill, &c., are the means by which wre obtain this dcfirable effeft, which is almoft a certain warrant of a ra- dical cure. It is indeed conftant, that compreflive draftings, fo effica- cious in the cure of moft wounds and ulcers, are in thefe cafes of ftili more remarkable advantage than in any other; and that the ftate of reft in which they maintain parts naturally moving on each other, by ena- bling nature to work with effect in uniting them, prevents fiftulous ul- cers, which would often have been the confequence of not attending to reftrain the natural motion of the parts, From what has already been laid, it appears how numerous the indi- cations are for the preferibing of reft in furgical diforders ; though we have only mentioned thofe in which nature requires an infpiflation of fomc of our juices. But the indications which call for the ule of this principle are not limited here ; they arc applicable to fo many furgical difeafes, that we may conftder it as the moft extenlive curative medium the art can employ. 'The cafes we have already gone through will im- prefs an idea of the truth of this aflfertion, and thofe which remain ftili to be explained, will give it the higheft degree of evidence. But wre fhall go through them in a luminary manner, becaule the indications which moft of thefe cafes prefent for the application of this method, are too pofitive to be miftaken ; and the employment of it then becomes a precept of the art.

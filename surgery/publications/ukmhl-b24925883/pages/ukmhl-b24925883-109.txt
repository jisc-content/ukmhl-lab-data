SECTION I. TO EXPLAIN THE EFFECTS OF COUNTER-STROKES ON THE SEVERAL PIECES CONSTITUTING THE LOWER EXTREMITIES, AND THE MODE OF CURE ADAPTED TO THE Mo FaLLS upon the feet, and leaps, being the mod: ordinary caufes of the violent counter-drokes which the lower extremities fometimes fuffer, it is natural that the effe&s which this caufe may produce upon the parts mod: contiguous to thofe which receive the fhock, fhould fird engage our attention ; fuch as thofe which concur in the formation of the ancle joint. The manner in which the lower extremities of the bones of the lea- are articulated laterally with the adragalus, the extent of furface which this bone prefents to the articulating cavity which receives its upper part, the motion of the other bones of the tarfus with which it is articulated, the great number of ligaments which unite thefe bones to each other, every circumdance fliews us, on the part of nature, a multiplicity of contrivances employed to elude, in the bed: manner, the effects of coun- ter-drokes in the articulation of the leg with the tarfus ; infomuch, that although, in leaps or falls upon the feet, it be the joint neared to the P 2 part

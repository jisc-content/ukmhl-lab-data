COUNTER-STROKES. iij the os femoris upon the tibia would not be fufficient to produce the leafc mifchief at the part where thefe bones are connected. Notwith- ffanding this,'tHe knee joint is much expofed to the effects of counter- Ur okes ; but they are chiefly occaffoned by falls upon the knee, or blows upon the patella, Reafon admits the poffibilityof counter-ffrokes with bad conlequences, in this part, and facts confirm it. A lad, of thirteen or fourteen years of age, having received a blow with a wooden fhoe on the knee, while the leg was half bent, the pon- tuflon was fcarce felt externally, notwithflanding which, he experienced at tiie inffanf, a fharp pain, which feemed to come from the infide of the joint.

In vain, after this difcovery, were all pofiible means tried to cure this young man ; deterflve injections, a proper pofition of the limb, dilatation and opening of the capfular liga- ment, every thing proved unfuccefsful. It being no longer poffible to preferve the patientâ€™s life without amputating the thigh, which his parents would not confent to, he died fome time after. The joint being opened, manifefted a very advanced caries of the articulating condyles of the leg and thigh, with an almoft total deftruction of the crucial liga- ments.

ICO ON THE EFFECTS OF which cannot often happen. The lower end of the thigh bone, is ge- nerally forced to make an angle, more or lefs obtufe, with the tibia, according to the violence of the fall ; which angle would even become fo far acute, as that the buttocks would come to the ground, unlei's the mufcles, known by the name of extenfors of the leg, exerted themfelves to oppofe this, or rather, unlefs they gave way only by degrees, and to a certain point'CK This firf flexion neceflarily brings on another, that of the trunk for- wards on the thigh ; a flexion which is moderated by all the mufcles fixed in the tuberofity of the ifehium, otherwife the head would f rike againf the knees. It is fufficiently evident from what has been And, that in all inflances of leaps or falls upon the feet, the fpinal column mud be bent forwards, and that the head then tends to fall downwards and forwards, by deferi- bing a curve ; but the mufcles which ferve to extend the head, the back, and the neck, are at this infant thrown forcibly into aftion, and retain the trunk and head in fuch a manner, that the motion remaining in them can only (except in falls from a very great height) bend the head and trunk forwards to a certain degree ; from whence it is evident, that in cafes of leaps or falls upon the feet, mod of the mufcles of the human body are employed in defraying the greatef part of the motion, by allow- ing the bones to which they are attached, to yield only by degrees, and fucceffively, to the impulfe, or action of the weight. Notwithftanding this admirable arrangement, nature is fill frequently in default. The direction of the Ihock, though a moderate one, is fome- times fuch as to elude the aft ion of mof of the agents which have been prudently employed to leflen it ; or elfe the motion is too violent to allow thefe agents to abforb a fufficient quantity of it to prevent mifehief in fome of the part through which it is tranfmitted. This fatal truth is 6 but

ON THE EFFECTS OF ’5* effect ; and the caries ot the facrum, and of the lumbar vertebrae, mav give rile to the p'oas abfeefs, as collections of matter in the pfoas mulcle .may occafion a caries of the fpongy bones that are near it. Khali ahoobferve, that a pally of the lower extremities mav lometimes be one of the effects refulting from counter-ftrokes upon the laft of the lumbar vertebrae; and that the debility which thele extremities experience, is the refult of a gradual comprefiaon which is then made upon the lpinal marrow, and which is the confequence of the mifehiefs going on, either in the cartilages, or in the bony lubftance of the vertebrae. Nothing can he more fimple than this procefs ; the violent fhock which the parts have buffered, caufing them to fwell, they muff neceflarily diminifh the diameter of the channel of the vertebrae, and confequently comprefs, in a greater or lefs degree, the fpinal marrow. I have l'een this happen to a young man of two-and-twenty, who, having fallen upon his buttocks, from the top of a fhed, feemed at ffrff to experience no remarkable acci- dent, lince he continued his work for at leaff three weeks after, at the end of which, he complained of the increafc of a dull kind of pain that he had always felt at the bottom of the loins, from the inffant of his fall: he ffill walked with tolerable eafe ; but this motion became more and more difficult: the lower extremities grew weaker by degrees, and at length totally loff their power of motion, without the patient having been ienfible of any great pain. Being brought into the hofpital, jmd queffioned with refpeft to the caule of his pally, it was concluded, that it would loon be followed by an abfeefs of the nature of thofe I have been /peaking of. Accordingly, about fix weeks after, a tumour appeared projecting from under Poupart’s ligament; this being opened fome time after, when it became prominent outwards, the patient foon paid the Tribute to nature. Upon examining the body, the two laft of the lumbar vertebrae were found affeCted with caries ; which in one ipot penetrated even into the channel of the fpinal marrow, while the ploas and iliacus mufcles feemed likewife, in this cafe, to have luffered only lecondarily. Abfccfles originally formed in thele mufcles, are not, however, unfre- quent ; and although they be only indireCUy the refult ot a counter- ftroke.

ON THE EFFECTS OF are children who periffi fpeedily after fuch exertions ; others, after having languifhed a long time under obflrudtions of the mefaraic glands, die at laft of the fuppurations that are formed in them : others again, aie feizcd with obftrudtions in the glands of the neck, or other external ligns which indicate a fcrophulous habit. This dileale, as terrible from the difficulty of cure as from the accidents that attend it, feems, from the fvmptoms that manifeft it, to be produced by too great a degree of acef- cency in the humours, which not being fufficiently agitated to correct this difpofition, an infpiflation of the lymph is produced, which forms the charadteriftic of the fcrophula. Nature feems of herfelf to point out the remedy, by manifefting an increafe of motion in all the efforts fhe makes to counteract this difeafe. It is therefore by conlulting this wife diredlrefs, who never deceives us when we underfh-uul what lhe intends, that we may prefume, that motion is one of the means, the efficacy of which is mod to be depended upon in the cure of fcrophulous complaints. Fadts, far from invalidating our ideas upon this head, feem to add a frefli degree of probability to them. Do we not indeed obferve, that all dif- folvents of the lymph (fuch as Rotroris) compofed of alkaline, ablorbent, and gently irritating fubftances(l7); that repeated purgatives, that mineral and faponaceous waters, &c., which fucceed heft in the treatment of this difeafe ; in a wrord, that all thefe remedies adt no otherwile than by increafing the motion in the machine to a higher degree than before their ufe ? Some of them too, it is evident, tend to fubdue the acefcent qua- lity of the liquids, which is one of the principal caufes of the infpiffa- tjon of the lymph, as much by the motion they excite, as by the alka- line and abforbent particles they contain (,8h The topics alfo applied with fuccefs upon fcrophulous tumours, and diflinguifhed by the name of diffolvents, fuch as the Emplaftrum de Eigo, Diabotanum, &c. ('9), feem to adl no otherwife than by increafing the power of motion in the obffrudled part. Nature herfelf, when (he cannot by her own powers, or with the affiftance of art, diffipate thefe tumours in an infenfible manner, doth fhe not effedt the diffolution of them by calling in the aid of inflammation, and fuppuration (lt>, which is the confe- 2 quence

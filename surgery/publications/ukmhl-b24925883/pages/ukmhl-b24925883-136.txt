of their correfpondcnt articulating furfaccs ; and in profecuting our re- learches, we found the upper part of the facrum likewife attacked with caries, as well as the laft of the lumbar vertebrae. The nature of the caufe, and the circumflance in which the woman was at the time Ihe received the lhock, together with the accidents Ihe experienced in the iequel, every thing announces, that there was a kind of disjunction or divullion of the facro-iliac fvmphyfis The two precedâ€™uig obfervations would properly come in l'upport of the polfibility of this disjunction from an external caufe, if even it had not been evi- dently demonftrated by a faCt, in the cafe of a man named Binai, of which M. Louis hath given an account, in his hiftoryr of the Royal Aca- demy of Surgery V From what has been faid, it is apparent, that in the cafe of a fall upon the lower extremities, when the morion is fuddenly flopped, there muff be many circumftances united to occafion fuch a counter-ftroke as ihall be capable of accomplilhing the disjunction of the facrum from the ofia innominata, or only a certain divulfion of the medium that connects them. But without a lhock fo violent as is necefl'ary to produce fuch mifehiefs, counter-ftrokes may occafion, in the neighbouring parts, inju- ries entirely as dangerous as thofe, the unfortunate iffue of which I have been mentioning. In a fall upon the two feet, which may have happened without fraCture of any of the pieces that compofe the lower extremi- ties, without contufion of the joints that are found in them, and even without any apparent divullion of the facro-iliac fymphylis ; it occurs but too frequently, that the whole effort of the counter-ftroke bears upon the bafis of the os facrum, and upon the laft of the lumbar vertebra?. In the fall upon the feet or upon the buttocks, for inftance, it is very poffible, that the motion of the upper parts upon the bafis of the facrum, Ihould be fo rapid, that this bafis, the laft vertebras of the loins, and even the ftrong and almoft bony cartilage which unites tliefe tw'o bones, Ihall experience a degree of preffure, fufficient to difturb their organiza- tion, and their internal texture ; and confequently to give rife to fubfe- quent

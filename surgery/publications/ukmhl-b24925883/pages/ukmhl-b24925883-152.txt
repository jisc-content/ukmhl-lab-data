146 ON THE EFFECTS OF Might I be allowed to hazard feme conje&ures upon this difeafe, I fhould fay, it is to be prefumed, that the fever which came on, was in- dependent of the effc&s of the lhock on the joint, feeing that it preceded, feveral days, the pain and the fwelling of the part ; but it may alfo be imagined, that without the previous mifchiefs in the joint, the fever would not have occaiioned thofe appearances which I obferved after the death of the patient. Still it is certain, that in the firtf inftance, we can- not carry too far the precautions which ought to be taken after violent fhocks in the joints : it is right to recal to our memory, and to that of others, that in tliefe cafes, we are not to fuffer patients to remain in that flatc of confident fccurity, which they derive from being allured, that they have neither a diflocation nor a fracture. In continuing to trace the effects of counter-ftrokes upon the bones that compofe the upper extremities, we find, that the laft of the pieces that concur in this ftrudture, in afeending from below upwards, is as much, and even more, expofed to them than any other ; this is fo cer- tain, that there are very few fradures of the clavicle that are the confequence of an immediate ftroke upon this bone ; fometimes it is occafioned by a fall on the elbow ; fometimes by a fall or a blow on the fhoulder, or on the fcapula. I have l'een feverai inftances of fractures of the clavicle, that have happened in all thefe different ways. The mecha- nifm of them is fo limple, that it is unnecefifary to explain it. Neither fhall I give an account of any of the cafes, becaufe they would contain nothing but trivial obfervations, little calculated to appear before the refpedable body who are my judges; nor fhall I mention any thing of the mode of cure, which is fufticiently known, and requires, btfides, no alteration refpeding the caufe producing the fradure : 1 fhall only recommend Mr. Bhasdorâ€™s bandage, as preferable to every other method of keeping the ftioulders conftantly back. We (ball conclude this fedion by obferving, that if it be fufficient, in order to clals any injury among the effeds of counter-ftrokes, that it fhould have taken place in a part diftant from that which received tlv ftroke,

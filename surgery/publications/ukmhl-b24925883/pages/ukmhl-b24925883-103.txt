COUNTER-STROKES, 91 PART I. It is evident from fads, that the principal pieces which enter into the compofition of the trunk, and of the extremities of the human body, are fubjed to the effeds of counter-drokes. Thole efpecially which con- ditute the lower extremities, are the mod liable to them, for which reafon, we are naturally led to begin with examining the mifchiefs that may be produced in them by l'uch a caufe, and the mode of relieving them. But before we proceed to this part of the quedion, it may be proper to notice fome preliminary fads, calculated to explain, almod intuitively, the mechanifm of counter-drokes, and the connedion be- tween their effeds and the caufe that produced them. Any part of the machine may fudain a fhock, whether a body put in motion lhall drike againd the part, or whether the part itfelf lhall drike, with a certain velocity, againd a body at red. This being premifed, let us obferve, id. That the feet, at every dep of progreflive motion, receive fhocks which are conveyed, without any fenlible effeds, along the inferior ex- tremities, the fpine, &c. 2dly. That thefe fmall Ihocks, which are nothing in the indance of habit we have been mentioning, are more fenfibly felt in leaps, and may be

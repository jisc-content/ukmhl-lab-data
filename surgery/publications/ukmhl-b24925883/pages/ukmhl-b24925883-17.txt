MOTION AND REST. 11 as in the liver, the fpleen, the pancreas, the kidneys, the organs'of ge- neration, the brain, and moft of the other glands, there are neceflary fecretions carried on, which are as much the product of the motion im- p re fled by the heart on the fluids it fupplies them with, as of that which they receive from the contracting power of thefe vifcera themfelves, which are far from being paflive. It is indeed by their combined adtion that life is continued and maintained ; but this is upon the fuppofition that the ftomach is conftantly receiving fubftances, proper to furnilh materials, for the repairs required to lupply the lofles and decays that are the neceflary confequence of excretion and motion. Under this fuppofi- tion, each of the organs eflential to life, will feparate from the primary fluid, tbofe liquids that are neceflary for its fupport, and for the fecre- tion it.muft perform, if it be a fecretory organ. But in order that the primary fluid may fupply materials fit for the repairing of the machine, and for the various fecretions that are to be carried on throughout the animal oeconomy, it is neceflary that the crude materials extracted from the aliments by the juices fubfervient to digeftion, and introduced by the laCteal veflels and the thoracic duCt into the general courle of the circu- lation flhould undergo l'ome previous elaborations. Thefe are brought about by the agitation of thofe materials, and by the friction and tritu- ration that are its effeCts, and which fit them, at length, to afi'ociate themfelves with other analogous materials, for the repairing of the ma- chine in which they are deftined to be employed. But in order that thefe elaborations may be fuch as are required, and that they may preferve in the animated machine the piinciple of life in its full vigour, it is necef- fary that the motion fhould be regulated at a certain medium indicated by nature. Below this medium, the elaborations produced can only furnifh thick, ill-concoÂ£ted materials for the purpofe of repairing ; the caufe of numberlefs obftruftions, which, after they have gradually em- barrafled the motions of the machine, at length deftroy it. Above this medium, motion gives the reparatory fubftances a hafty elaboration, that brings them too fpeedily to that putrid decompofition which is their laft period, and which confequently does not allow them to be employed for a fufficient length of time in the fupport of the machine.

U2 ON THE EFFECTS OF It-' inficad of falling upon the hand, the perfon Falls*upon his elbow, and that the olecranon he not fractured, the infide of the joint may ex- perience a counter- ftrokc accompanied with fymptoms more or lefs vio- lent, and which may be attended with all thofe fatal confequences which J have mentioned in deferibing the effect? of coutiter-ftrokes in the joints of the lower extremities. In November 1768, I opened, in a young man of eighteen years of age, an abfeefs, the origin of which was in the elbow joint, and which had proceeded from a fimilar caufe. The patient had telt great pain at the inftant of his fall ; a confiderable fwelling had come on ; and when I faw him, 011 the 17th day after the accident, he had a confiderable de- gree of fever ; it was in vain that I bled him twice, and applied anodine and emollient refolutive topics to the tumour ; it terminated in fuppura- tion, and the fluctuation becoming evident a few days after, I delayed not the opening of it. The pus being mixed with a glairy fluid, and the introduction of my finger into the opening, afeertained the feat of the difeafe. The patient feemed relieved for feme days after the opera- tion ; but the bad fvmptoms loon returned, the fever increafed, the dif- charge became foetid ; the edges of the wound were livid and much fwelled ; the patient was delirious ; and during the fpace nearly of three' weeks, he feemed to be in too deiperate a fituation for us even to be able to attempt amputation with any prolpedf of luccefs. After this period, however, he grew better by degrees ; the lymptoms were relieved, and the wound being drefled with dry lint, was perfectly healed, without there having been any apparent exfoliation ; there were even hopes, when the patient went out of die hofpital, that the joint would flill retain a certain freedom of motion. It feldom happens that mi {'chiefs are produced in the joints, unlefs in thofe cafes where the lliock is not confiderable enough to occalion a free- ture ; but let us fuppofe, that in a fall upon the elbow, the lliock Ihould be fuflicient to produce a folution of continuity in the bone; it will lithcr be the olecranon, or the upper part of the fore arm, which will yield to the

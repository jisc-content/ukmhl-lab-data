121 counter-stroke s. S'uppofing however, that thefe means of cure fhould not have been employed in time, or that they fhould have been ineffeduaJ, and that, to the primary accidents of contufion in the hip joint, there fhould fucceed an abfcefs in the eavity, with deftruclion of the ligaments, caries of the articular furfaces, &c., how are we to proceed in this cafe ? Mull: the patient be left to his deplorable fate, and mull art remain inactive under fuch circumflances ? We fhould be aimoft tempted to anfwer in the affirmative, from what we have feen of the inefficacy of its efforts in feveral of thefe cafes. Art here confifts lefs in doing, than in avoiding to do what may be done ; for a cure of this kind can only be the work of nature. The in fiance we have given of the foldering of the thigh-bone with the os innominatum, ferves at lead to fhew us one of the refources which nature referves to herfelf in defperate cafes. Suppuration having once taken place in the itifide of the joint, the foft and flexible parts which border it and maintain the bones in their fituation, having been deflroyed, nature hath no means of prefervation left, but to form, by a complete anchylofis, one continued bone between the trunk and the thigh ; and flie tends to this end by the very mechanifm, by which the deftrudlioh of the injured parts is effe&ed. In confequence of inflammations and fuppurations formed in the joints, the ligamentous parts are infenfibly confumed, the bony and cartilaginous parts grow carious, and exfoliate in the fame manner, and the fragments of them are drenched in the pus which is daily forming in the neighbouring parts attacked with fuppura- tion. This pus, while it is not fufceptible of fpontaneous alteration, from the accefs of the air into the cavities where it is collected, is for the mod part a mild and beneficial fluid, which, far from re-ading upon the bony and cartilaginous parts, takes charge, on the contrary, of their fragments, and ferves as a vehicle to carry them out, after having, undoubtedly, contributed to detach them from the mafs that fupplied them. Now

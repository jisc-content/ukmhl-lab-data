ON THE EFFECTS OF 53 condud a cure, fo happily and To wifely begun, to its end ; for the bony and cartilaginous lurfaces being now difengaged from all the fragments nature hath chofen to feparate, prefents us with lively and flcfhv granu- lations, which are in that ftate of inflammation proper to contract an ad- hefion with contiguous granulations of the lame kind. This adhefion confolidates itfelf by degrees, and forms at length a compleat union be- tween two bony furfaces, deffined originallv to move one over the other. But in order to obtain this falutary anchylofis, nature requires reft, and reft continued with the greateft perleve ranee. In this great and admira- ble operation, Die hath loft nothing but motion ; and by this indifpenfable iacritice, fhe has preferved a limb with part of its functions, and prevented the mutilation of the machine. The defeription I have here given, is not a romantic idea of phyfiology and pathology; it is a truth founded on fad, of which I can myfelf give many inftances. I have got a preparation by me in which the thigh bone is foldered with the os innominatum, and the polilhed oftilied furface of which, together w'ith the folidity of its union, leave me no room to doubt that the fubjed it had been taken from, had furvived a long time the formation of this anchylofis. Not having known the perfon, nor been acquainted wdth the hiftorv of his cafe, I can only form conjedures upon this fubjed. But the neck of the thigh bone being extremely fhortened, it is to be prelumed, that its anchylofis with the 03 innomina- tum has been produced by a caries, which may have attacked the head of the bone and the cotyloide cavity in which it wâ€™as lodged ; and that this union has been preceded by abfeefles, and other fvmptoms common to a caries of the joints. The following fad will contribute to lupport this opinion. A poor beggar who has an anchylofis of this nature, and in whom I had frequently noticed fears at the upper part of the thigh, as well on the infide as on the outfide, hath allured me, that after a fall upon the great trochanter, he had for a long time fullered extreme pains, which had been at length terminated by fucceftive abfeefles, that had kept him in

<8 ON THE EFFECTS OF the bony fragments to the reparation of which it hath contributed, fhould refume it into the general courfe of the circulation, by taking it up from its cavity, through means of the feveral abforbents that open on the fur- face of that cavity. The return of the matter being then effected as {lowly as its collection was formed, the parts which compol'e the cavitv, mu ft return to their proper ftate as gradually as thev were difturbed from it, without accident and without inconvenience. With refpect to the bones that are primarily affected, and which have almoft adopted the nature of flefh during the long and important procefs of exfoliation, no fooner are they difengaged from thefe loofe pieces, than they begin to recover their folidity ; and if feveral vertebrae, for inftance, have partaken of the injury, they form among themfelves a common mafs of oftifi cation that in fome meafure fupplies their bodies, and termi- nates this important cure, which, as wre may obferve, can only be the w'ork of nature, time, and reft But however advantageous reft may be, however pointed may be the indication for it in the inftances before mentioned, there are ftill other cafes of caries in which this indication is more precife, and lefs liable to be miftaken, than in thofe of the dorfal and lumbar vertebrae ; thefe are the caries affe£ting the joints.

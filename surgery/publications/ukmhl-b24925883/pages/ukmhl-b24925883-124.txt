118 ON THE EFFECTS O I him, that thefe difeafes were incurable, in which ever way thev were treated, he had almofl refolved to leave this cafe to the elforts of nature alone, The fluctuation of the pus being, however, manifeft, he deter- mined to give vent to it by a luitable opening ; the pus which came out at firft, had no fort of bad Imell, as in the preceding observation ; but that which flowed at the fublequent dreifings, was both great in quantitv, and ofFenfive; leveral linuffes led to the head of the thisfii bone, and into the infide of the joint. The patient did not long lurvive this opening ; the fever increafed, the difeharge became ferous and very feetid, and he died three weeks after the operation. Upon examining the joint, the fame mifehiefs nearly were found as in the preceding obl'ervation ; only the capfular ligament Aill exified entire, at the internal part of the thigh ; but it was much thickened and inflamed there. In 1762, a man, of forty-five years of age, having fallen upon his right knee, at the time that he was heavy laden, could neither rile up again, nor lupport himlelf upon his thigh.

Three years having elapfed in this fiate, without his having been able to make any ufe of his limb, he came to the Hofpital, having at the upper and back part of the thigh, a very conliderablc collection of matter, which not finding an ifluc through the openings already mentioned, was let out by a limple punCture with a lancet, that the patient might, if pofiible, avoid the melancholy late of thole who had been treated in a contrary manner. T he matter, which flowed in great quantity, brought away with it, feveral fragments of hone ; and the new opening added to the former, another fifiulous orifice, which favoured the habitual difeharge of the matter.

42 ON THE EFFECTS OF and lubfequent fadts appear to have completely confirmed my con;cbtures on this point. t Firft, the patient who had been the fubjedt of the preceding obfer- tion, and whom I had always kept within my notice, having been feized in i 769 with a peripneumony of which he died, I was allowed to in- fpedt the body, and my firft care was to take notice of the diborders the fpine had experienced three years before. I found, as I fufpedted, feve- ral vertebrae, the bodies of which were confounded with each other; thefe were the ninth, tenth, and eleventh, of the dorfal vertebrae, which had loft at leaft half of their longitudinal dimenfions, while their fpinal procefl'es which had not buffered the leaft alteration, formed a projedtion and a remarkable convexity outwards. This firft part of my conjedtures being verified, I have negledted no opportunity of informing mvfelf, what fhare reft might have had in thefe fort of cures. Accordingly I have queftioned all deformed perlons, whenever I could do it with propriety, and defired them to give me an account of the accidents that had hap- pened to their fpine previous to its deformity. Thofe who are become fo, merely from a lateral projedtion of this column, without having had any colledtion of matter during the growth of this projedtion, or after it was formed, have fcarce complained of any thing more than a gradual weaknefs of the part affedted, and have never been obliged to keep from motion entirely. They have almoft ail been able to rife out of bed at all times, and even to walk with a ftick without experiencing any very acute pains. But thofe in whom marks of former abfceffes were to be obferved, who in fome fmall part of the fpine have an evident projedtion and convexity outwards, have all been obliged to keep their bed for feve- ral months, fometimes for whole years ; and it was never till after a long- continued reft, that the fpine began to recover, at the part affedted, a fufficient- degree of .lolidity to allow them to fupport thcmlelves and to walk. If reft, fuch as it might be, without being fubjedted to any rule, hath produced good effedts in thefe cafes, we may readily conceive that it would

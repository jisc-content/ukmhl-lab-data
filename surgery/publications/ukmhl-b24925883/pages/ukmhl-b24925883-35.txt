MOTION AND RES T. *9 -cei from an SnfpiiTation of the fynovia, and from a rigidity, the liga- ments and aponeurofes furtounding the joint may acquire, motion may be confidered here too as the means to prevent an anchylofis. But if we coitlider that the Bate of the parts which leads us to apprehend this in- convenience, is the confequence of their ten hen, inflammation, and dif- pofition to fuppuration, as alfo of the long inactivity they mull be kept in, in order to accomplifh the firfl indication which is the cure of the fraCture, we fhall conclude that the anchylofis, in this cafe, is but a fe- condary accident which muft not be attended to, at leaf, for fome time. Motion is undoubtedly the proper remedy in this cafe too ; but previous to our having recourfe to it, it is neceflary that the confolidation of the bony parts fhould be confiderably advanced ; and that the inflammation and irritation of the ligaments and aponeurofes fhould l'o far be overcome, that motion may not produce in them a p>ainful exteniion which might tend to excite the inflammation afrefh, and to form abfeefles in the part. As foon as thefe chief indications are obtained, we mull call in the allifb- ance of motion to prevent the anchylofis with which the joint is mena- ced. If the articulation be Bill fufceptible of an evident degree of mo- bility, its own motion alone excited and increafed by degrees, will, in time, reBore to the ligaments and aponeurofes their flexibility ; and to the fynovia its ordinary fluidity. But if the fynovia have acquired too much confBence, and that the infpiflation of the fluids which fill the canals of the ligaments and aponeurofes, fhould have made them too rigid to admit of being put in motion without caufing very great pain, we muB then avoid perfiBing too obBinately in the ufe of this method.. I have feen confiderable fwellings and ecchymofes brought on after an inconfiderate ufe and exertion of motion under fuch circumfiances ; thefe have made it neceflary to poflpone for a long time the ufe of this effica- cious method, which had failed only from the negleCt of precautions proper to have infured its fuccels. In thefe cafes the motion of the joint muA be prepared and preceded by oily and faponaceous embrocations^1^, by warm and emollient baths, and elpecially by Bupes. Thefe remedies, by tranfmitting a gentle motion among the infpiflated juices, and even by beginning their liquefaction through means of the penetrating particles F they

,5 ON THE EFFECTS OF who live in a ftate of inaction and indolence, that we find that exorbi- tant fatnefs which befpeaks an habitual depofit of glutinous and* oily juices in the divisions of the cellular fubflance. In fuch perfons it is not neceflary that this juice, in many refpe&s fo pernicious, fhould be taken up into the general mafs to avoid the pernicious effe&s of fri&ion, which they are far from carrying to excefs by mufcular action. It is among fedentary and idle perfons that we ufually obferve thole infpifl'a- tions of the lymph, which occafion obftrudtions fo difficult to conquer ; and thofe nervous dil'orders fo common in the prelent age, and which are evidently produced by the thickening of fome of the juices of the animal oeconomy. This may the more reafonably be prefumed, as thefe affedlions are mitigated by the continued ufe of diluters, of warm bath- ing, which fupplies a greater quantity of fluid to thefe infpilfated juices, and of cold bathing, which, while it affifts in this flift intention, encou- rages, at the fame time, their feparation, by {lengthening the tone of the folids that are to a£t upon them. We may add that thefe difeafes are cured by a vigorous and continued exertion of mufcular attion, which, after it has reftored thefe infpilfated juices to their natural fluidity, is alone capable of maintaining them in it. From what has been faid, it follows, that motion has the property of attenuating our fluids, and of keeping them in a Hate of fluidity propor- tioned to the a£live caufe. This fluidity may be either too great from the too violent and too long continued exertion of the agent that produ- ces it; and, in this cafe, it is called diflolution, and the machine is ex- pofed to thofe diforders which arife from this kind of caufe ; or elfe this fluidity may be lefs than the neceflary degree, which may proceed from the weaknefs or inadlion of the agent that ffiould keep it up. In this inftance, the want of fluidity takes the name of infpilfation, and the diforders maniftfled in the animal oeconomy, are fuch as are produced from this kind of caufe. PART

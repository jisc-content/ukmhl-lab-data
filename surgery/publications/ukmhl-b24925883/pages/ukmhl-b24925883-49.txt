It may even be prefumed, that it would prove one of the mod; certain means that could be employed to prevent deformities of the fpine^1), for it is not at the time this column dilcovers a tendency to projedlion, that we ought to leave it opprefled by the weight of the fuperior parts which it fhould naturally fuftain. We fnould wait, till by reft and a horizontal pofition, the pieces that compofe the column {hall have loft, by the ufe of proper remedies, that morbid ftate of foftnefs which had difpoled them to be thrown out. Thefe two means, of reft and a horizontal pof- ture, are equally indicated whether the progrefs of the diforder be aflifted by a weaknefs of the ligaments connedting the vertebrae, or by the adtion of the mufcles. But thefe unions of the vertebrae, after a greater or lefs deftrudtion of their bodies, which we have obferved to happen in the dorfal vertebrae, may alfo take place in the lumbar vertebrae ; and might not reft contribute to effect this falutary purpofe in cafes of caries with which the vertebrae of the loins are fo frequently affedted ? Let us con- fult fadts, that we may know how far this remedy is to be depended upon in the cure of fo terrible a difeafe. I have feen many of thefe carious vertebrae, and the death of ail tnofe * who have been attacked with them, feems to proclaim that they are an incurable complaint. But before we lay down this dreadful prognoflic, let us trace the difeafe throughout its progrefs, and let us confider the phcenomena it prefents to us during its long continuance ; thefe may fug- geft l'ome ideas from whence a more comfortable prognoflic may be de- duced, and which future fadts may perhaps juftify. We frequently fee, after a fall on the buttocks which (hall have occafioned a concuffion in the lumbar vertebrae, after a blow received on thefe parts, after a violent and painful effort made to raife too heavy a load &c., after fuch acci- dents, I fay, we frequently fee that the perfons who have buffered them, complain, fome time after, of a dull pain in the region of the loins, with a difficulty of walking, which increafing gradually, without ever caulnw' O

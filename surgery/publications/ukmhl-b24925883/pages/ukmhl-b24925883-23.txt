MOTION AND REST. 11 PART TJ. EXPLANATION OF THE INDICATIONS WHICH ARE TO LEAD US IN PRESCRIBING THE USE OF MOTION AND REST IN SURGICAL DISORDERS. From the fhort account we have been giving of the neceflity of mo- tion, and of its effects, it will not be difficult to difcover the indications which are to lead us in prefcribing or forbidding the ufe of it in furgi- cal diforders. If it be required to refill or prevent the infpiflation of the fluids in the cure of thefe diforders, it will be neceffary to call in the affidance of motion, provided there be no particular circumdance that may render the ufe of it improper. If, on the contrary, the plan of cure require to give a better confidence to the fluids, and if the effects of motion fhould counteract this plan, we muft have recourfe to reft. We fhall be in no danger of making an improper application of thefe two curative methods, if we can fettle our ideas upon the advantages that attend them, by facts and inftances fupported with proper reflec- tions ; and in order to throw this part of our effay into fome method, we will divide it into two feCtions. In the fird we fhall expofe the indi- cations which are to determine the ufe of motion ; and in the lad, thofe in which red is to be prefcribed. SEC-

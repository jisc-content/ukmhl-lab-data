m ON THE EFFECTS OF perficiai caries; and its external l'urface, which had received the flroke, had experienced no kind of alteration. Effects limilar, or nearly lo, of counter-ltrokes in the knee joint, would undoubtedly occur more frequently, after violent falls on the knees, or fharp flrokes on the patella, if proper means, which readily prelent themfelves to the furgeon, were not uled to prevent thel'e conle- quences. Reft is the firft of the remedies which it is proper to have recourle to in thefe cafes; and the lingle precaution of avoiding, for a few days, every kind of motion of the knee joint, aflifted with two or, three bleedings, and the ufe of fome emollient and anodine embrocations, fuch, for inftance, as the balfamum tranquillum, or the application of fome refolutive cataplafms, would probably have prevented the mifehiefo which I have juft been giving an account of. But the following cafe, is one, which more particularly proves, that falls upon the knees, do not always confine their effects to injuries within fide the joint. • A woman, about fifty years of age, w'as brought to the Hofpital after a fall upon the right knee; the patella wras not fractured, but the parts fur- rounding it were much fwelled ; and the pain Ihe felt in the motions of flexion and extenfion ('h-) , might have been l'uppofed to arife only from the violent contufion which the external parts had fuffered. By careful exa- mination, however, and repeated trials, I dilcovered an evident fracture of the lower part of the thigh bone, or rather ‘a feparation of its con- dyles. Fractures of the thigh very often aiife from a fimilar caufe ; the kind of arch formed by the thigh bone, renders it, notwithflanding its ftrength, very liable to frafiture, when in falling from a certain height, the inferior extremity of this bone is fuddenly checked, while its upper part is ftill prefled upon by the weight of the whole body in motion- The mechanifm of the fracture which then takes place, is eafily under- flow! ; and the method of cure which it requires. It is exactly the fame as if the fracture had been produced by a blow applied immediately to die

MOTION AND REST. S tion ; to wit, a greyifh fubftance, the fecretory organ(4), and a white Or medullary fubftance, the union of which forms the origin of the firft pair of nerves, deftined to convey that particular fluid fitted to the pur- pofes of fmelling ? Do not the fecond pair of nerves, which become' the immediate or- gan of vifion, take their rife from a particular fubftance, diftinguifhed by the name of thalami nervorum opticorum, and which feems to form a kind of fmaller, in the midft of the larger brain ? The medullary fub- ftance, which their external furface prefents, is probably impregnated with a fluid already fecreted in fome other part, and winch, in its paf- fage through the greyifh fubftance of thefe thalami, receives a higher degree of elaboration before it reaches the medullary fubftance, which is in their center, and which is the origin of the optic nerves, continually replete with a particular fluid, calculated folely to receive the impreftions of light. The pineal gland compofed of a greyifh fubftance, and which has two medullary threads produced from it, is it not alfo the ftrainer of a fluid deftined to fupply fome important functions ? The pituitary gland, the ufe of which we are as little acquainted with as with that of the former, may it not likewife be the elaborately of fome particular fluid abfolutely neceffary to life ? This may, at leaft, be prefumed, when we confider all the precautions nature has taken to fecure it from outward injury, and from being comprefled by the parts that furround it ; for nature does no- thing without neceffity or without a motive, and wherever we can fol- low her fteps, or difeover them by conjecture, we find that her choice is always fupported by reafons which compel us to admire and be filenTT ' The third pair of nerves gives us another proof that nature does not make an indiferiminate ufe of the two fources we have indicated. It is from the medullary fubftance of the brain that this pair draws the fluid it fupplies to the mufcles that are governed by it, which are the movers of the eye, an organ endowed with automatic motions, produced by the C fluid

COUNTER-STROKES. 127 whence we perceive how difficult it is, in the circumftance of very rapid motion of the trunk upon the lower extremities, that any mifchiefs ifhould be produced in the parts which concur in the union of the offa innominata with the os facrum, efpecially when both the extremities bear together. But it may happen, that the ihock fhall be fo violent, ,as to elude all the precautions taken by nature, and to produce, even in the cafe here fuppofed, if not a disjunction of the bones, at leaft a divulfion of the liga- ments that conneCt them, a contufion of the cartilages, and of the bones tbemfelves; injuries which almoft always produce very ferious com- plaints ; or it may happen, that the motion of the trunk, being flopped by one of the extremities only, the force fhall be fpent entirely upon the articulating furface of the facrum on one fide, and that in the very difad- vantageous circumftance of that bone being neither preffed upon late- rally, nor fupported by the oppofite fide. Even admitting in this cafe that the velocity of the upper parts, multiplied by their weight, fhould be reduced to a fmall matter when it came to be applied to the os facrum, yet it would not be furprizing, that the parts which flrengthen the arti- culation of this bone, on which the whole effort is fpent, fhould fuffer, at the inflant of the fhock, a very dangerous divulfion. All that has been faid here, is nothing more than an anticipated explanation of the mechanifm by which fliocks, conveyed by a counter-flroke to thefe parts, have given rife to the mifchiefs that have fallen under my notice. A man of forty years of age, having climbed a tree, fell upon his lower extremities from the height of about fifteen feet, and at the inffant of his fall, had no other fenfation than that of a general commotion, ac- companied with a fharp pain at the bottom of the fpine. Being brought home, he would not fubmit to be blooded, and only took a few bottles of vulnerary infufions. The very next day, he went out; the little pain he felt, did not feem to him to merit any attention ; he walked tolerably well for feveral days, and followed his bufinefs as ufuah But about the thirtieth day from his fall, he began to grow lame ; ftill horvever he felt ( S 2 nothing

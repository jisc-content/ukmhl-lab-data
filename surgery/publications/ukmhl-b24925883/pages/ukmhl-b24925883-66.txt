ON THE EFFECTS OF Go with car:reft, at this period, and in the fubfcquent treatment of the difeafe, r.s we have before proved, is one of the chief methods of cure correfponding to the views of nature. We cannot likewife but be l'cnfible of the efficacy of reft in inflam- matory tumours of the tefticles, and in a falling down of the womb. ]s it not alfo evident in cafes of commotion, either of the l'pinal marrow, or of any of the important vifcera that are contained in the abdomen, the thorax, and the cranium ? The accidents which follow thefe commotions, being always the effect of a violent degree of motion communicated to thefe parts, do they not prefent us with pofitive indications for the pre- fcription of reft M ? 1 have feen a young lady of nineteen, who, after having by chance jumped fome few fteps off a ftaircafe, remained fenl'e- lefs for feveral hours. She afterwards fell into fwoonings every time ine wanted to lit upright in her bed ; and it was only bv reft and a horizontal pofture, perfevered in for feveral months, that lhe was com- pletely cured of this accident. From what has been already faid, therefore, we may be convinced that reft, as well as motion, is indicated on fo many occalions, that we might ftrictly affirm thefe two means of cure to be univerlal and exclu- live ; and, what is more, there are infinite numbers of realons that prefent themfelves in fupport of this conclufion. The dilorders which the animal oeconomy may experience, are, in faÂ£t, nothing more than the produce of an excels or deficiency of motion W ; and nature and art cannot really fucceed in repairing thefe dilorders, but by increafing the power of motion when it is too weak, and diminifliing it when it is too ftrong. Nature, indeed, in all her efforts to cure, clearly fhews us thefe two points of view, to which all that medicine and lurgery can preferibe, i:i the dilorders belonging to their relpedtive province, is obli- ged to conform itlelf. But amidft the feveral curative means, to be able to chufe thole which can produce either of thele effects, in the exact proportion required for the recovery of health, would be the utmoft perfection of our art; to which human Ikill, however, can never expeCt to

OS THE E F F E C T S OF The remedies that fuccetd bed, at this period, are derived from the clais of lubdances which contain a mucilaginous principle, fufc.ptible of a Uighrly acefcent fermentation, calculated to give fome d gree of confidence to the liquids, and to reftorc the folids by degrees to their proper tone. Oranges, lemons, frefh vegetables (lightly acidulated, new bread, ripe fruits, grapes, warm wine, honey, See., are the remedies which feem more particularly to pofiefs this property. Motion, lb falu- tary in the fil'd lfages of t!ie lcurvv, becomes now very dangerous ; for it hath been obferved in the third, and more efpecially in the fourth, flage of this dileafe, that fevcral patients have died of internal haemor- rhages, after having inconfiderately uled exereife which, though mode- rate in itlblf, was dill above their drength ; after having made fome lud- den motion, or after having been only dirred with quicknels, and moved incautioufly from one place to another. But this date of extreme difiblution that the feurvy offers at this period, is leldom found among perfons who live upon land, except in prilons and dungeons, where ina&ion, cold, dampnels, bad food, and affliction, often contribute to carry this dileafe to its highdt period ; for among the common people, even among thofe who live mod poorly, the feurvy feldom fhews us any thing moie than a vice of inlpiffation, againd which external motion, combined with warm antilcorbutics, may be employed with fuccefs. Accordingly in thofe obftruCtions of the* legs, which have a purple cad, with hardnefs, and which are deemed fcorbutic, fo far from its being ncceffary to prelcribe red, as in other obltruCtions of thefe extremities ; exercile, on the contrary, and walking in dry and warm weather, combined with the remedies iuitable to the feurvy, have always appeared to me the mod proper means of relief; and 1 have often obferved that thefe obdruftions were lefs conliderable, and lcls fhining towards the evening, after a good deal ot walking, than two or three hours after the patients had got out of bed. From what has been faid, it appears, that the indications which lead us in the application of motion to the cure of furgical dilorders are evi- dent.

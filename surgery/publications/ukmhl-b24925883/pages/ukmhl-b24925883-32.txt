ON THE EFFECTS OF i 6 upon in tlicl'c cafes, if we employ it with all the precautions required bv the difference of circumftances. We may even have rccourfe to it with confidence in thole cafes which feem more particularly to forbid the ufe of it. Fractures of the joints, for infiance, by occafioning an extravafation of bony matter into their cavity, feem at iirft fight to make an anchylo- iis unavoidable, and yet, in thefe cafes, motion employed with Ikill may frequently prevent it. To be convinced of this from theory, we have only to trace the mechanifm by which this extravafation is made in mod circumftances. If the bones, fractured at their extremities in the joints, have not experienced any evident change of pofition, or if they have been replaced in their original fituation by the Surgeonâ€™s art, the bonv matter exfuding from the lurtaces ot the folution of continuity, tends, as in other inftances, to confolidate the divided parts, in order to reftore them to their functions. It is true, indeed, that the bony matter, being extravafated, exceeds the level of the parts brought into contact, and that as it thickens, it forms a folid mafs on the divided part, and that this mat's, on the fide of the cavity of the joint, mud be lb much the more contiderable, as the bony matter mud have met with lets opposition in its growth ; but it by no means follows that an anchylofis mud be the ne- ceflary confequencc of this. Motion may be employed with advantage to prevent this accident, and the bony projection which threatens the joint with it, indicates, by its very formation, the employment of this method, which can never aft more effectually than while the callus is fiill foft. For this real'on, when we may prcl'ume that the fractured pieces have begun to acquire a certain degree of coherence among them- fielves, by means of the bony matter that mutt confolidate them, it will be neccfiary to give gentle motions to the joint, and to repeat them as of- ten as circumftances will permit. It is evident that the projection of the callus, which is (till yielding, will be retrained, and that at length the play of the articulation will be perfectly reftored. Suppofmg however that the projection had acquired a contiderable degree of confidence, we mud not, on that account, abandon the joint to the anchylofis that may threaten i

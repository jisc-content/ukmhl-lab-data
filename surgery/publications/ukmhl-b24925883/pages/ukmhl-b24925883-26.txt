20 ON THE EFFECTS OF charaderize this difeafe. Nature, it is true, generally fucceeds in difli- pating its paroxyfms by a procefs of greater or lefs continuance ; but this procefs is nothing more than an increafe of motion, which mani- fefts itfelf, firft, in the part affedcd, by the fvvelling, pain, and inflam- mation we obferve in it; -then in the whole habit, by the fullnefs of the pulfe, and the evident fever that often accompanies this difeafe. It is by means of a fimilar increafe of motion, that nature, at length, prevails, in comminuting and attenuating the earthy materials that are depofited, fo as to render them fit to be remixed with the fluids accumu- lated in great abundance about the feat of the pain, and thus to facili- tate their expulfion through all the natural channels of excretion. No- thing can be more eafily proved than that thefe diforders proceed from want of motion, nothing is more evident than that they are relieved by an increafe of it ; and I fhall now proceed to fhew that increafe of mo- tion will alfo prevent them. The rich, over whom the gout more particularly exerts its dominion, living in the midft of idlenefs and luxury, feem to be afFe&ed with a demi-palfy ; though they are in poffeffion of the loco-motive faculty, th.y do not put this power into adion ; the law of labour feems not to have been impofed upon them, at leafl: it is become a habit with them to elude it. Thefe beings are therefore almofl: reduced to that radical kind of motion which is independent of the will ; the other kind which is fubjed: to its influence, and which ought to compleat the efFeds of the former, fo as to give the repairing fubftances the neceflary degree of ela- boration to maintain health, is never fufficiently exerted by them to ob- tain this efted. The imperious call of want, which urges this iecond kind of motion, is never heard by them, and deprived of this falutary incitement, they live in a ffate of indolence, the fweets of which are defervedly embittered by their eftcds. With thefe Sybarites, accuftomed to high living, motion is, in general, not fufficiently exerted, to give to the quantity of crude materials con- ftantly admitted into the courfe of the circulation, a degree of clabora- 6 tion

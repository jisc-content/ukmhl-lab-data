10 ON THE EFFECTS OF be not abfolutely necdliry to life, they do, at leaft, contribute in a very evident manner, not only to its fupport, but alfo to its energy. The effects of tire exertion of this loco-motive power cannot, there- fore, be indifferent in the cure of furgical diforders ; they may facilitate or diflurb this end as they are properly or improperly applied. The aca- demy certainly experts from thofe who fhall difcufs the queftion propo- fed, an explanation of the cafes and the times when it is neceffarv to forbid or to advife the exertion of this power. But to proceed with order in io interefting a fubjeCt, after having briefly expofed the effects of the motion of thofe organs whofe aCtion conftitutes life, it will be proper to explain the fhare which the motion of thofe on which life does not im- mediately depend, lias in the prefervation, and if we may be allowed to fay fo, the perfection, of the vital principle. The heart is moved and exhibits a fucceffion of dilatations and con- tractions, by means of which the circulation of the blood is carried on. The arteries deftined to convey this fluid, prefent the fame phaenomena to our view. But thefe aCtions diminifh as they proceed, fo that the contracting power which belongs to the arteries, and which is ftill fo vi- fible in fmall arterial branches, is, at length, reduced in their laft fubdi- vifions, in the Ipunphatic and ferous veffels(6) that are continued from them, and in the origin of the veins in which they terminate, into a kind of elaflic power which conftitutes the tone or fpring of all our parts. This laft is an imperceptible aCtion, fufficing only to keep up the motion of the fluids, to preferve them in a fluid ftate, and to maintain life, which is the confequence of this fluidity. The cheft dilates and contracts itfelf alternately by the aCtion of muf- cles, over which the will has but a very limited power of fufpenfion or acceleration ; fo that refpiration is habitually carried on wdthout the con- currence of the will. The ftomach is poffeffed of a power of contrac- tion proper to the fibres that compofe it ; the inteftines are endowed with a vermicular motion which is particular to them ; in thefe vifcera, as

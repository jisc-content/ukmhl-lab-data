ON THE EFFECTS OF io6 fymptoms, taking it for granted, that the cafes, in which the application of any of the different topics here propofed may be of advantage, will not be overlooked. The counter-ftroke in the ancle joint, may alfo give rife to a fraflure of the fibula, the lower extremity of which, being forced a little to one fide in an oblique fall on the feet, refills, while the weaker part of the bone gives way and is fradlured, without however occafioning a luxation of the foot iideways. 1 have met with more than one inftance of l'uch fra&urcs ; for which reafon, in all accidents of a fall upon the feet from any height, or even of a wrench, we muff always examine- whether the in- jury we perceive about the joint, he not complicated with a fracture of the fibula, it is rather difficult to difeover this accident, when the lower part of the leg has begun to fwell ; the turning of the foie of the foot a little inwards, may be the tffedl of the extenfion of the ligaments, or of adiafta- lis, and not be an indication of the fracture of the fibula, which we mull endeavour to find out by fome more certain figns. The beft way of doing this, is to grafp the lower part of the leg with one hand, while, with the other, we move the tarlus to each fide ; and with a little patience and habit, we fhall diflinguifh the crepitation of the bone, which is the pathognomic fign of the fraflure. The following fa<5t will fhew how neceflary it is to make this ditcovery. A mafon, having made a falle ftep, felt an acute pain about the external ancle, which he thought to be merely the confequence of a flight fprain, and paid no gieat attention to it; he even continued to work, notwithftanding the fwelling which came on the part, and the increafe of the pain, which however became at length fo violent, that he was forced to give over work on the third day after the accident; but not having recourfe to any chirurgical afiiftance, he abftained only partially from motion, and applied, merely according to his own ideas, different poultices upon the part. At length being obliged to come to the hofpital, he met with every affiftance which his cafe required; but it was no longer time to think of difeovering the fracture, the fwel- Jing was confiderable, and already announced a fuppuration formed about the joint, which foon manifefted itfelf on the application of remedâ€™es pro- per \

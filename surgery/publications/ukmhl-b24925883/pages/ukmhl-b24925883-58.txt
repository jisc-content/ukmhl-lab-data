OX THE EFFECTS OF But 51 intended to relieve. Some fubfcquent fadts have entirely confirmed me in this opinion. A man about fifty years of age applied to me in 1770, with the bones of the w rift fo carious, that in two or three places one might pal's a probe through them, by following fome fuiulous openings that prefented them- felves on the outfjde. The wrift and the ha id, which were oedematous, confiderably 1 welled, and of a dark blue colour, feemed to require ampu- tation fo much the more urgently, as the patient was tormented with a flow l'uopuratory fever; it was even the advice of a man very lkilful in the profellion, not to defer having recourle to this laft refource. Not- withftanding this, I ventured to temporize, and after having applied the ufual dreffings for two days, 1 carefully doled all the fiftulous openings with dreffings that were not irritating, and the hand and wrift being co- vered with comppefl'es dipt in a ballamic and lpiritous embrocation, made with the volk of an egg, oil of rofes, and brandy, I placed them in junks. The parts being thus kept in a perfect and conftant ftate of reft, I made no fcruplc of leaving the firft dreffings on for ten days without a renewal, more efpecially as neither the pain nor the difeharge required them to be removed fooner; and at this time, it was curiolity, rather than any abfolute neceffity, that wras the motive of my doing it. As I found the difeharge lefs in quantity, thicker, and lefs foetid than when the patient was drefled every day. I judged it proper to put oft* the re- moval of the fecond dreffings for twenty days ; and at this period the fwclling of the hand and wrift were half reduced, and every thing feemed to befpeak, as much from the patientâ€™s countenance and pulfe, as from the nature of the difeharge, that hopes might already be entertained of a fortunate termination of this dreadful difeale. In about two months and a half after this, thefe hopes were completely realized ; for at this time all the fiftulous orifices were perfectly cicatrized, and the cure was terminated, with no other inconvenience to the patient, except lols of motion in the wrift, which has not lince prevented him from doing his ufual work (rK

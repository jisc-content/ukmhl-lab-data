ON THE EFFECTS OF 94 To afk an explanation of the effeds of counter-ftrokes on the feveral parts of the body, exclufive of the head, is to beg the queftion concerning the exiftence of thefe counter-ftrokes, and of the mifehiefs that enfue from them. To demand an expofition of the means of relieving them, is to require of thofe who may attempt to folve this important queftion, a methodical and confiderate application of the means which the art may fuggeft to a man of knowledge, who, in the effects of counter-ftrokes, perceives at once, both the connection between the caufe and the effcCt, and the mechanifm by which the injuries he fees have been produced. If it be a matter of furprize, that the exiftence of counter-ftrokes in the head, fhould have appeared problematical, even at a time when fup- ported by reafon and experience, it is ftill infinitely more aftonifhing, that the efforts of counter-ftrokes on other parts fhould have been in fome fort overlooked, and that no writer fhould refer, at leaft explicitly, to this kind of caufe, numbers of accidents which he mult have feen (*). Although it mult be acknowledged, that practice is not fo much affeded by this omiffion, as might be imagined, on account of the number of cafes in which a knowledge of the mechanifm by which the accident was occa- fioned, could have little influence on the mode of cure to be purfued, yet there are cafes in which a knowledge of this mechanifm can only fuggeft, with propriety, the curative means to be employed. This is fufficient to render a folution of the propofed queftion very interefting, although it fhould not even convey to the mind that degree of fatisftidion, which we always experience, when we are convinced of having difeovered the immediate relation of the caufe to the efted. Counter-ftrokes, in the feveral parts of the body, exclufive of the head, are fo frequent, that dileafes of the utmoft importance in furgerv, may be confidered as being produced by them. I fhall endeavour to prove this propofition by fads, rather than by argument. Befides thofe which 1 have colledcd from the experience of fome great mafters in the art, whom I have attended, there are no inconfiderable number which have occurred in my own pradice, and which all contribute in the moft palpable man- ner

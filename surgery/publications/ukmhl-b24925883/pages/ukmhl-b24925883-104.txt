ON THE EFFECTS OF be attended with many mifehiefs in parting through the parts to which the fhock is conveyed. ^dly. That in falls on the feet, it often happens, that the fhock is fufficient to produce accidents, which require the artirtance of art; but in this refpeÂ£t, the accident is always in proportion to the height of the fall, and to the ftate of the parts which receive the motion, as we (hall make it appear in a future difeurtion. Man is deftined to walk upright, to run, to leap ; and is therefore ex- pofed to all the bad effe<5ts that may relult from the kind of fhock we have been fpeaking of. Accordingly, we cannot behold, without admi- ration, the precautions which nature has employed, in the manner by which the pieces that compofe the lower extremities and the trunk, are articulated with each other, in order to prevent the invincible refinance which the feet meet with on the ground, from producing (at leart: in ordinary inftances) any mifehief in the bony parts conrtituting either thefe extremities or the trunk ; and alfo in order that the important vifeus contained in the cavity of the cranium fhould be preferved from any fhock fufficient to difturb its organization. A curfory review of thefe objedls will enable us the better to underhand all the contrivances of nature to elude the effects of counter-ffrokes that may be tranfmitted through this channel. The bones of the tarfus and metatarfus, are formed and articulated in fuch a manner, as to leave a hollow of a certain depth in the lole of the foot; a cavity from which nature derives other advantages bdide that of making a paflage for tendons, blood-vefiels, and nerves ; for this hollow forms a kind of arch, the parts of which being moveable upon each other, may give way a little in yielding to the motion of the upper parts that prefs upon them j the motion, therefore of thefe parts being in foine meafure dertroyed here, they retain the lefs of it.

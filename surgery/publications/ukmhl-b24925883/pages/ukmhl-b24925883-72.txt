66 NOTES BY THE AUTHOR. Such was the ftate of this patient, when this effay was fent to the Academy ; and it had been fo much mended fince that time, that the cure appeared certain. The patient had recovered his appetite, digefted well, the matter which ifl'ued from the fiftulous opening was thick, and lefs in quantity, the fpine gathered ftrength daily, and the patient began to walk with a flick. But the fpine being more crooked than I at firft imagined, 1 thought that by bringing it gradually to a flate of extenfion, while the intermediate fubftance which was to fupply the place of the bodies of the vertebrae was flill capable of yielding, the deformity might at leall be partly corrected, or its farther progrefs prevented. With this view I ordered him to lie on his back, and placed a fmall bolfler under the part of the fpine that projected. The ddire the patient had of being cured without deformity, induced him to bear the pain this brought on, without complaining. He no longer flept at night, and though I made him change his pofture, and removed the bolfler as foon as he had told me of the pain he buffered from it; yet 1 had the mortification of feeing, that the lymptoms which had difappeared, immediately after this trial, returned. The dilcharge became more and more plentiful; a flow fever appeared and continued ; a tumour even, but very deep feated, ma- nifefted itfelf on the loins oppofiteto the fiflulous opening ; and there came on at intervals, a lofs of appetite, a diarrhoea, and after fix months gradual decay, the patient died, Though I found, on opening him, the bodies of the two laft dorfiul vertebrae entirely deftroyed, and an incompleat union between the bodies of thole vertebrae that were in contact, I am not the lefs perfuaded that the patient would have been cured, had it not been for that unfeafonable extenfion of the fpine, which brought on the return of the pain, and of the other lymptoms, When nature, for the prelervation of an individual, makes a lacrifice of the motion, or of the figure of any part, it is often neceflfary that art fhould not ft rive againft her in attempt- ing to reftorc what fire gives up, but fhould only be the fpedlatrefs of what is going forward. This faff, and lome others which will be recorded in a collection of obfervations I am preparing to give to the public, will furnifh lufficient proof of this aflertion ; and in this refpeft I lhall not hefitate

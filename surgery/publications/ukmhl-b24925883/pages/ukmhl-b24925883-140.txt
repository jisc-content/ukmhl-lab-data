ON THE EFFECTS OF >34 ftrokc, we muft be able nearly to eftimate its power, we mud know the nature anil relative fituation of the parts that have fuffered ; and from thefe preliminaries, we may form a proper judgement of the nature of the in- jury that has been produced at the inftant of the fhock. The method of cure then becomes rational, and leaves us no reafon to apprehend tliofe errors which arc the confcquence of empiricifm and ignorance. With inch principles, the proceedings we are to adopt in counter-ftrokes, the action of which bears upon the os facrum, upon the facro-iliac fymphyfis, and upon the lumbar vertebra?, are already traced out for us. The kind of miichief which Inch a caufe may produce upon thefe parts, requires bleeding, more or lefs repeated, according to the violence of the fymptoms; refolutive and fpirituous embrocations, a proper diet, and laftly, the moft abfolute reft. This cannot be too ftrongly recommended in disjunctions or divulfions of the facro-iliac lymphyfis ; and in this cafe, comprcft'es dipt in refolutive and fpirituous topics, and fupported by a circular bandage applied moderately light, and palling over the hip bones, are precautions by no means to be neglected. It is all'o neceflary to have recourfe to them in cafes where the counter-ftroke hath produced mil- chiefs among the lumbar vertebrae ; but in this inftance, the circular turns of the roller muft be carried above the region of the loins ; that part of the fpine will be kept more fteady by this precaution, and the bones which compofe it will be lefs liable to be affcCted by motion, which is always hurtful in fuch circumftances. To thefe precautions we muft add, that the horizontal pofitio i is the only proper one in thefe cafes ; but we muft take little account of the number of days the patient is con- fined to his bed ; it is better to carry our precautions too far, than to be deficient in them. So many unfortunate perfons have been the victims of their own neglcCt in this particular, that the attention of practitioners cannot be too much fixed upon this point. It is by the very firnple means I propofc, that after falls with counter-ftrokcs on the os lacrum and the lumbar vertebrae, 1 have luc- ceeded in relieving the iirft fvmptoms, which threatened fubfequent mifehiefs as alarming as thole 1 have been mentioning : among feveral 4 others,

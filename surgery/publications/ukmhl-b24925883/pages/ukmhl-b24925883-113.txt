Notwithflanding the good confiitution of the patient, the free openings that were made, and the careful ufe 'of all the means that were the heft calculated for his relief, yet he went through a feries of accidents, which obliged him, about two months after, to fubmit tor the amputation of his leg, as the only way to fave his life. â€¢ But let us fuppofe that we fhould be called in time, and that the frac- ture of the fibula fhould be difcovered, the treatment proper for fuch an accident is too well known for me to dwell upon it here.

MOTION AND REST. 59 Is ic net, in fadt, an eftablifhed rule, that we mu ft have recourfe to reft in all furgical diforders, where motion may impede any falutary cohefions, or may occafion pains, irritations, or frictions that may bring on dis- agreeable confequences, or may difplace parts that fhould be kept in the fttuation they are, or may produce dangerous eftufions of blood, &c. ? Therefore, in cafes of recent wounds we with tore-unite, in diflocations newly reduced, in ruptures attended with bad Symptoms, and which have been juft returned by the taxis, in ioiies of blood which come on during geftation, in cafes of wrenches and forcible extenftons of the liga- ments, in ruptures of thefe parts, as of forne mufcles and tendons, in contufions of the joints ; in all thefe cales, it being evident that motion indifcreetly employed is liable to bring on great mifehiefs, thefe mil- chiefs themfelves are fo many abfolute indications which diredd the pre- fer ribing of reft. Befides, experience has fo fully proved the neceffity and advantages of this method in all fuch cafes, that it would be need- lefs to infift any longer upon it. We (hall only obferve, that in cafes of Ihocks in the joints, and of di- vulfion, and contufion in the ligaments that furround and ftrengthen them, as motion neceflarily produces pains which cannot but increafe the irritation, tenfton, and inflammation which ufually attend thefe ac- cidents from the firft, reft prefents itfelf as the moft efficacious method of cure that nature can furnifh under fuch circumftances. We ought then to rely upon it the more, as it cannot be fupplied by any thing elfe ; for all that art fhould attempt, is only to mitigate the pains, to af- fuage the irritation and tenfton of the parts, and to prevent inflammation and the fatal fuppurations it may occafion. Now, amidft all the methods that art can fuggeft to counteract thefe efredts, reft is the moft powerful; bleeding, diet, and external applications being only acceftfory helps, the efficacy of which is fo much the more evident as they are combined with this principal agent b*0. But fuppoftng that thefe means fhould have been negledted in the firft inftance, or that notwithftpnding the applica- tion of them, abfeefles fhould be formed in the cavities of the joints, and that the l'urface of the bones defigned for their motion fhould be affeefted with

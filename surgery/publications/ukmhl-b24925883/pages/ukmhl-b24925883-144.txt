Â»38 O N THE. EFFECTS OF t'-iac ot the fternum, were the conftquencc of this hilt (hock, becaufe, hi the ir.ftant that the body had been flopped in its fall by the middh- of t!;c back, the lower extremities on one hand, and tile upper part of the- trunk on-the other, had prelerved a fufficient quantity of motion to force the fpine to fuch a degree of extenfion, that the mufcles which go from the fternum to th.e head, &c., being violently llretched, had eifecled the- feparation of the firft bone of the fternum from the fecond. This me- chanifm is too limple, not to be leadily underftood. With refpedt to the curative indications that prefented themfelves for this double accident, th ey were fulfilled by a method as eafy as it was effectual fo true it is,, that a man of genius always enriches the art, while he feems to fimplitV it. The enl ightened prailitioner of whom we are fpeakitig, ordered a hollow to be made in the bed, at the part correfponding to the fraiture of the vertebrae ; he placed thick cufhions under the nates, with a pillow under the fhoulders, and employed every precaution neccffary to keep the fpine conftantly bent forwards, and to bring the head in the fame di- rection : this he accomplifhed by attending only to the pofition of the patient. The elongation of the fpine, which is never more confiderable than in the flate of flexion, brought back, into their natural fituation, the fpinal procefTes, which were a little turned to one lide, and maintained them there by means of the conftant tenfion of the ligaments and muf- cles that are fixed into it. The upper portion of the fternum was kept, by the fame contrivance, in exail oppofition with the inferior extremity ; fo that at the ufual period of the cure of frailures, the patient went out perfeilly well, and without having buffered any lymptoms, except Inch as are ufual, and to remedy which, the proper methods had been em- ployed immediately after the accident. I make no doubt but that many frailures of the fternum have been produced by the fame kind of mecha- nifm, and which, for want of being known at the time, have given rife to abfeeffes, and to troublefome caries of the bones- SECTION

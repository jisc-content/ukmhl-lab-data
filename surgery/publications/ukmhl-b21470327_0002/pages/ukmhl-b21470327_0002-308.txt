292 EPULIS AND PARULIS. [book VI. Comm. forceps of his own invention. (CEuv. Chir. ii, 24.) Sprengel in- forms us that this method was practised by the sni-geons of the middle ages. It is described by Brunus (Chir. Mag. ii.) Sprengel thus explains the other operation described by our author: " II se servait d'^xx^ instrument particulier auquel il donnait le nom de airaOiov ttoXvitikov, et qui etait garni h Tune de ses extremites d'un ciseau, kvkX'ktkoq."

That the instrument had a chisel (ciseau) at its extremity is altogether improbable, and this supposition is unwarranted by the context. KvaOicjKo^ means the cup-like or concave end of the instrument. SECT. Xj;VI. ON MAIMED PAETS. When the ears or the lips have been mutilated, we restore them by first dissecting the skin below, and afterwards bringing together the lips of the wounds; then removing the callous parts, and afterwards sewing and glueing them together. Comm. COMMENTARY. This section is taken from Galen. (Meth. Med. xiv.) See, also, the ' Isagoge.' Celsus's observations are too minute and lengthy for our limits. Suflace it to say, that he directs the edges to be pared, and then united with sutures, (vii, 9.) Bhases' directions for the treatment of mutilated eai-s and noses are to the same effect as our author's. (Cont. xiv.) Similar ones are given by Albucasis. He directs us to make the suture either with needles, as in gastroraphe, or with a thi'ead. (Chi- rurg. ii, 26.) , . -, . .i Celsus has been supposed, but, as we thmk, mcorrectly, to touch on the operation for the hare-lip. (vii, 10, 6.) See Sprengel (Hist, de la Med.) SECT. XXVII.

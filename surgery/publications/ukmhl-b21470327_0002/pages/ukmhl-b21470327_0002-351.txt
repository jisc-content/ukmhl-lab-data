335 SECT. XLvii.] BURNING OVER THE LIVER. Commentary. The description given by Albucasis is so Comm. like oui' author^s that there can be no doubt of its being ' ' ' borrowed from him. When there is a great redundance of fat and flesh, he dii'ects us to make two lunated incisions, the larger comprehending the smaller, and having dissected away the intermediate skin to unite the edges by sutures. (Chirurg. ii, 47.) Haly Abbas repeats the same description in almost the same words. (Pract. ix, 40.) E-hases recommends the operation upon the authority of Antyllus and our author. (Contin. xiv.) SECT. XLVII. ON BURNING OVER THE LIVER. If the pain be attended with weight in those who have abscess in the liver, it is an indication that the fleshy part of the liver is affected; but if the pain be acute the matter is rather in the coats, and "we must burn the part thus :â€”Having strongly heated slender, knobbed cauteries, we apply them a little above the loins at the extremity of the liver, making an eschar. But having burnt the whole skin and reached the coat we must evacuate the pus : after the discharge of which, having used lentils and honey, with the applications from honied water, and things of an incarnative nature, we have afterwards recoiirse to epulotics. Commentary. In cases of hepatitis, which do not yield to Comm. the usual remedies, the author of one of the Hippocratic' ' ' treatises advises us to burn the side with spindles of boxwood dipped in oil, or with fungi. (De Morbis Internis.) Aretseus directs us to open abscesses of the liver with red-hot irons. (Morb. Chron. i, 13.) Celsus mentions that some open abscesses of the liver with a scalpel, and some burn the vomica, (iv, 8.) Cselius Aurelianus, however, disapproves of this practice. (Pass. Tard. iii, 4.) Albucasis describes the operation like our author, and gives a drawing of a spear-shaped instrunient for opening the vomica. (Chirurg. ii, 30.) Haly's description is quite similar. (Pract. ix, 75.)

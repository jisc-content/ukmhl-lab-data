For those who have been scourged, the skin of a sheep newly taken oflF, when apphed Avhile yet warm, of all remedies cures the soonest, effecting this purpose in a day and a night. Comm. COMMENTARY. See Aetius (xiv, 62); Avicenna (iv, 4, S, 7); Haly Abbas (Pract. iv, 26) ; Alsaharavius (Pract. xxxi, 2, 1); Ehases (Contin. xxviii.) Aetius gives similar directions. The following is said to be an excellent apphcation for the stripes of a whip : mix washed lime with raw eggs, and add some rose cerate. Aetius, Galen, Nonnus, Avicenna, Rhases, Haly Abbas, and Alsaharavius join our author in recommending the fresh skin of a newly-killed sheep as an application in such cases. Alsaharavius recom- mends an ointment containing white wax, rose-oil, and ceruse, when the wounds are deep ; when there is any apprehension of heat and inflammation, and more especially if the patient be plethoric, he approves of venesection. When on the other hand the patient is weak, and is in danger of falling into a state of syncope, he recommends musk and wine to be admi- nistered. When there is much appearance of ecchymosis he speaks of scarifying the part after the heat is gone. Rhases recommends a composition of ceruse, litharge, wax, and rose- oil, as a general application. Most of the applications recommended by Bertapaha contain litharge, cerase, tutty, wax, and oil. (De Ulceribus, 16.) The other earlier medical authors of modern times likewise follow the ancients in this case. SECT. XIII. TO MAKE HAIRS GROW ON A PART THAT HAS BEEN BURNT.

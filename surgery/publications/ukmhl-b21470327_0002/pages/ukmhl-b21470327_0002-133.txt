The directions of Aetius, more especiaUy respecting the con- stitutional treatment, are highly important. In cases where there is a redundance of blood he recommends venesection, in others both purging and bleeding; and in certain cases he dn-ects us to pay attention to the state of the liver and spleen He relates a case of an ulcer on the hand, which he cured by opemng a vein leading to it.

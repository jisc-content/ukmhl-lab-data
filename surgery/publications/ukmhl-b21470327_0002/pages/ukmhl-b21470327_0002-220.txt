204 SALAMANDER. [book v. a woman's milk. When the violence of the disease has sub- sided they may eat with advantage Theban palm-nuts boiled in wine. Comm. COMMENTARY. Isidorus says of the buprestis, " animal est '—'—' in Italia parvura, simillimum scarabBeo longipedi.'' (Orig. xii, 8.) See also iElian (H. A. vi, 35); Pliny (H.N. xxx. 10.)

Comm. COMMENTARY. The principal symptoms, as detailed by Nicander, are inflammation of the tongue, torpor, trembhngs, aberration of mind, vibices, &c. He treats it Hke narcotic poisons, with stimulants and attenuants, such as pme-rosm, the leaves of ground-pine, nettle-seed mixed with the flour of tares, &c Dioscorides, Avicenna, and most of the authorities direct to treat this case of poisoning like that of cantharides; us

'260 TRICHIASIS. [book vi, this subsection, having extracted the thread, and putting a small compress under the thumb of the left hand, we stretch the eye- brow upwards. Then arranging other small compresses on the canthi at the extremities, we direct the assistant who stands behind to stretch the eyelid by means of them. Then by means of the scalpel used for sutures we make the first incision, caUed the veruted (shaped like a verutum or short dart) a little above the hairs, which are in their natural state, extending from canthus to canthus, and penetrating only the depth of the skin ■ and afterwards we perform the incision called the lunated, beginning at the same place as the former, and carrying it up- wards to such a height as to comprehend the whole redundant skin, and ending in like manner as it did. Thus the whole skin comprehended ^dthin the incisions wdl have the shape ot a myrtle leaf, of which portion, having perforated the angle on the right hand with a hook (tenaculum), we dissect away the whole skin: then washing away the clots with a sponge, we unite the hps of the incision by thi-ee or four sutui-es, beginnmg at the middle, and passing the needle itself through the .undcr- section The thread should be made of wool; and having cut away the superfluity of the thread, not close to the sutures, but so as to leave a superfluity of three fingers' breadth, we stretch this remainder along the forehead and fasten it ^^^^^ f any of the agglutinative plasters. But the hairs of the eyehd are to be freed from the sutures with the point of a needle Such is the common and safe mode of performing this sm-gical operation. Some avoid the dissection of the skin, and there- fore after the under-incision, having stretched the redund^t skin by means of the forceps used in operations on the eyelids, they cut it off with a scalpel, and apply sutures as described above But if the iiTitation from the hairs is produced only by a part of the eyelid, it will be proper to confine the operation to that part. Then soaking the compresses m oxycrate, ana laving them on the part, we secure them with bandages con- tinning to moisten the dressings with diluted oxycrate until the third day; after which we remove them, and Jetting away the superfluous parts of the threads, we anoint the eyelids eith« Xaffron,'gla— or some of the anti^nflam-tory ^c^^^ such as that formed of saffron and roses. But if tbe^^^^^f'J inflam" we apply some one of the softening plasters, and soothe

AMPUTATION. 409 SECT. LXXXIV.] upon the celebrated Caius Marius. See Cicero (Tusc. Disput. ii.) Comm. Pliny (H. N. xi, 104); and Plutarchus (in Mario.) It seems to '"^^ have been a very painful operation, since it is mentioned as a proof of his fortitude that he submitted to it without being boimd. It would appear that the learned and ingenious Aurelius Severinus used to perform it. (V. Mangeti Bib. Chir, xvi.) SECT. LXXXm. ON THE DRACUNCULI OR GUINEA-WOKMS.

Sometimes the extremities, such as a hand or a foot, having mortified, so that the bones themselves are corrupted, either from having been fractured by some external means, or from having become putrid owing to some internal cause, it is neces- saiy to saw them off; before doing which the parts surrounding the bones must be divided. But since, when this is done first, as a considerable time is required for the sawing, there is dan- ger of a hemorrhage taking place, Leonides properly directs us not to divide all the parts at once unless they are completely mortified, but first to cut the part where not many nor very large veins or arteries are known to be situated, down to the bone quickly; then to saw the bone as expeditiously as possible, applying a hnen rag to the parts which have been cut lest they be torn by the sawing and occasion pain, and then having cut through what remains, to apply red-hot irons to the vessels and stop the hemorrhage thereby with compresses of lint, and to apply proper bandages with the dressings suitable to suppu- rations.

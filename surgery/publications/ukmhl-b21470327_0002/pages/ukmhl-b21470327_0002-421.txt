SECT. LXXX.] 405 CONDYLOMATA. SECT. LXXX. ON CONDYLOMATA OR EXCRESCENCES^ AND FISSURES. Condyloma on the fundament differs in situation alone from that on the female parts of generation, being a wrinkled excrescence of the anus, either from a preceding inflammation or fissure. At first, then, it is called an excrescence, but when it becomes callous, condyloma. These also, like the former, are to be taken hold of with a forceps and cut out, and the cure completed with escharotics. Fissures are occasioned princi- pally by hard faeces, and being slow of granulating owing to their callosity, must be converted into recent ulcers by paring them with the nails or a scalpel, when they may be made to granulate by proper applications. Commentary. Celsus briefly directs us to seize the condy- Comm. loma with a forceps and cut it out by the roots. Should any ' ' fungous flesh arise it is to be kept down with the squama seris. (vii, 30.) Aetius gives a fuller account of these affections than our author. The condyloma, he says, is a tubercle which forms in tlie soft wrinkled skin about the anus. When it becomes hard and callous he recommends us to take hold of it with a forceps and cut it out by the roots. Old fissures he directs us to treat by paring their edges and applying suitable dressings, (xiv, 3.) The same treatment is recommended by the Arabians.

In new-bom children the anus is sometimes found imper- forate, being blocked up by a membrane. If possible, then, the membrane is to be ruptured with the fingers, but if not, we must cut it with the point of a scalpel, and accomplish the cure with wine. And since often in adults, owing to an ulcer not properly cured, a stricture takes place at the anus, we must break it with a convenient instrument, and treat it

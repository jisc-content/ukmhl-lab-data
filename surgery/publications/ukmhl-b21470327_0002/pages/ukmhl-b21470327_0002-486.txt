470 [book VI, FRACTURES. SECT. CV. ON THE FOOT. The astragalus cannot be fractured by any means, being guarded by bodies on ail bands; by the tibia, the fibula, and the OS cuboides. But the scaphoides, the bones of the tarsus, and those of the toes, and the cuboides itself, are fractured bke those of the carpus, metacarpus, and the fingers of the hand, .so that what was said of them is apphcable here and need not be repeated. Comm. COMMENTARY. Hippocratcs remarks that these bones can ' only be fractured by some sharp and heavy body. They are to be treated like fractures in general, only that they do not re- quire splints. He recommends the recumbent position with the foot somewhat elevated, and states, in strong terms, the mischief brought on by unseasonable attempts at walking. (De Practuris, 10.) Galen, in his Commentary, gives an accurate anatomical description of the bones of the foot. Celsus is very brief on this case. He conducts the treat- ment on general principles.

By this means the de- rangement of the bones will be rectified. He approves of a splint to the sole. We find nothing worthy of notice in the works of the other authorities. SECT. CVI. ON THE AKRANGEMENT OF THE LIMB. "When the thigh or leg is fractured, the manner of arrang- ing the limb will be as important a consideration to you as the other treatment. For the evenness of the fractui-ed pai'ts is especially preserved by this means when properly performed. Some, therefore, lay the fractured part upon a canal, either of wood or of earthenware, or else they lay the whole Hmb upon it; others apply it only in cases of fracture with a wound, be- cause, say they, these cannot be bound with splints. But tlie moderns altogether reject the use of these canals for many rea-

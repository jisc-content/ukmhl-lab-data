242 HELLEBORE, ETC. [book v. We are unable to determine satisfactorily tlie natui-e of the condisi, which is treated of by the Arabians, under the pre- sent head. See Ehases (ad Mansor. viii, 49); Avicenna (iv, 6, 1, 16.) Alsaharavius calls it cundes. The symptoms, he says, are dryness of the nose, throat, and palate, sneezing, muttering delirium, pain of the stomach, and, unless speedy rehef be brought, death. (Pract. xxx, 1, 24.) Ardoyn men- tions that some referred it to the struthium; but the above characters do not at aU apply to the soapwort {saponaria offici- nalis, L.),which is the ar^ovQiov of Theophrastus andDioscorides. See further Sprengel (Comment, in Dioscor. i, 192.) The sow-bread {cyclamen Europceum) is also treated of by the Arabians under this head. See Avicenna (iv, 6, 1,16); Rhases (ad Mansor. viii, 59) ; Alsaharavius (Pract. xxx, 1, 24.) The symptoms, according to Alsaharavius, are swelhng of the throat, and strong pain of the bowels. The sow-bread is treated of as an article of the Materia Medica by Dioscovides (ii, 193.) Dioscorides (M. M. iv, 82) does not reckon the oleander {nerium oleander, L.) destructive to man, but the Arabians rank it among the deleterious substances, of a heating and desiccant nature; and recommend for it emetics, with the decoction of fenugreek, figs with honey, and the like. See Aiiceuna (iv, 6, 18); Alsahararius (Pract. xxx, 1, 27) ; Rhases (ad Mansor. viii, 36.) ^ ^ The anacardium, or Malacca bean, is treated of as a poison Iw Bhases (Contin. xx, 2; ad Mansor. viii, 35) ; Avicenna (iv, 6, 1, 9); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxx, 1, 42); Haly Abbas (Pract. iv, 50.) They all describe it as an irritant poison, and recom- mend emetics of animal and vegetable oils, with demulcents, to obviate the bad effects of it. The apocynum, althougli not treated of by the ancient au- thorities on toxicology, is described as a deleterious substance by Dioscorides (Mat. Med. iv, 81); by Galen (De Simpl.); and by Pliny (H. N. xxv, 83.) It appears to be the periploca GrcBca, L. Dioscorides and PHny likewise reckon saffron, or the cro- cus sativus, a deleterious plant. Its deleterious action is very ^^?he atramentum sutorium, which was a solution of vitriol, was used as a poison. See Cicero (ad Familiar, ix, 21.)

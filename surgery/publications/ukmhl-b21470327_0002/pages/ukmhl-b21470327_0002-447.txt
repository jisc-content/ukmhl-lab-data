431 FRACTURES. SECT. XC] tlie pains increase and the fever in like manner, the bone changes colour, and then unconcocted pvis is discharged; and if the person who has the charge of it neglect the case, and has not recourse to perforation, still more grievous symptoms will come on, vomiting of bile, convulsions, disorder of intellect, and acute fever, tinder which circumstances one must decline operating. But if these are not present, and the membrane has not sepai'ated, and if the fracture be a mere fissure, it may be cured by scraping alone, although it be of considerable depth. If it extend to the diploe only it is to be scraped down to it, or the broken bone removed, as will be described. If broken into small pieces, these also are to be extracted with a convenient insti-ument. And if the membrane separate, and you have treated the patient from the commencement, and if it be winter, endeavour by all means to effect the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day; but, if in summer, before the seventh, while the afore-mentioned symptoms have not come on you may operate in this way : The Operation.â€”Having first shaved the head about the wound, we make two incisions intersecting one another at right angles hke the Greek letter X, one of them being the wound already existing; then dissecting the four angles at the top, so that the bone about to be perforated may be wholly laid bare, if there be bleeding we apply pledgets moistened in oxycrate, but if not dry ones; and then applying a compress out of wine and oil, we use a proper bandage; and next day, if no new symptom supervene, we proceed to perforate the affected bone. Wherefore, having placed the patient on a seat, or in a recHn- ing posture suitable to the wound, and stuffed his ears with wool in order to avoid the noise of the perforation, we loosen the bandage from the wound, and having removed all the dressings and sponged it, we direct two assistants with small twisted bands to retract the four angles of the parts lying over the fracture, and if the bone be weak, either naturally or from the fracture, we cut it out with counter-perforators, beginning first with the broader ones and changing to the narrower, and then usmg those which are of the form of a specillum, striking gently with the maUet to avoid shaking the head. But if the bone be strong it is to be first perforated mth that kind of perforators

192 SEA-SCORPION. [book v. fig iDraiiclies steeped in sweet wine, or of the brains of the fish itself. Comm. CoMMENTiSUY. A great variety of remedies for the wound ^ of the sea-dragon are described by Nicander. For an account of the dracoj see Dioscorides (vi, 45)|; Aristotle (H. A. viii, 13); ^lian (H. A. xiv, 12); Nonnus (276); Pliny (H. N. xxix, 20); Aetius (xiii, 39); Phile (80); Avicenna (iv, 6, 3.)

CoMM Commentary. See Dioscor. (vi, 45); Nonnus (277); Aetius (xiii, 40); Atheufeus (353, ed. Casaubon.); Avicenna (iv, 6, 3, 33 ) Bochart says of the sea scorpion: "Is cum terrestri nihil habet commune prater venenatos aculeos, non in cauda sed m capite et toto corpore sparsos." (Hierob. ii, 635.) According to Sprengel, it is either the scorpcena scrofa or the cottus scorpius Bloch. (Comment, in Dios.) It is a fish still very much dreaded on account of its sharp spmes. See Yarrel (Br. Fishes, i, 76.) SECT. XXIII. THE PREPARATION OF THE BLOOD OF THE SEA- TORTOISE. The blood of the sea-tortoise is to be prepared for keeping in this way. Having stretched the tortoise with its beUy upwards on a wooden or earthen vessel, cut ofi" its head qmckly,

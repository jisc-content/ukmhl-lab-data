SECT. XXXVI.] ULCERS. gg applications at first, (i, 3.) Rhases recommends much the same Comm apphcations as Serapion. (Ad Mansor. v, 16.) v—- SECT. XXXVI. ON THE SIMPLE ULCER. Since a simple ulcer is merely a division, if one will brin- together the parts which are separated, and apply a circular bandage around, the divided parts will adhere together without more ado. It is necessary, however, when at one of its Hps the ulcer is everted obliquely, to begin the bandaging there and turn it to the opposite side. When it is deranged both ways It will be proper to use a double-headed bandage, and thus to bnng the lips together; for when nothing has fallen between the lips, such as a hair, or a sand, or oil, or filth, or the hke, the ulcer wiU adhere completely. When the ulcer is large so that the separated parts cannot be completely brouo-ht together by the aforesaid bandaging, they are to be first united with sutures, and then bandages are to be thus applied, and those remedies used which are caUed agglutinants, which have tue power of drying and consuming the coHected moisture, and prevent more from flowing to the part.

s^^T. XXI.] ERYSIPELAS. The Pseudo-Dioscorides recommends strong stimulant appli- cations containing son, misy, sulphur, onions, &c Avicenna seems to confound herpes with mp^mecia, which detracts from the value of his account of it. (iv, 3 17) Rhases describes separately the formica miliaris or herpes miharis, and the herpes estiomenos or exedens. For the former he recommends astringent applications, for the latter strong caustics In his^Continens' he directs the herpes miliaris to be treated with cholagogues and astringent applications berapion m Hke manner describes two varieties of the disease but his account of it contains nothing particularly interesting! Haly Abbas adopts the division laid down by Galen (Theor vui W.) His treatment also is quite similar (Pract. iii 29 ) Alsaharavius the three varieti'es are described by the names of formica or erysipelas muscina, for- mica corrosiva (herpes exedens?), and formica miliaris He describes the formica corrosiva as being a dangerous complaint spreading deeper and deeper. His treatment, although amp^ detailed, contains nothing remarkable (Pract xxix 9 ) The earner modern writers on medicine being the servile copyists of the Arabians, describe herpes by the name of formica as a disease nearly allied to erysipelas, and like it ansing from corrupted bile. See Guy of CauHae (ii, 1), and- Theoderic (in 16). For the herpes esthiomenos or lupus thev recommend the application of arsenic or the actual cautery. ' SECT. XXI. Fon ERYSIPELAS.

Whatever division we adopt, it will make no great difference as to the treatment.

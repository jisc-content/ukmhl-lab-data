^'i-] PHALANGIA. Igg Commentary. See a similar plan of treatment recom- mended by Aetius, Dioscorides, Nonnus, and Eliases. Simeon Seth recommends the decoction of mallows, which appears to have been a domestic remedy generally used in such cases. See also Geopon. (xii, 12); and Pliny (H. N. xx). Virgil alludes to this practice ma passage which has been often misunderstood (Georg. IV, 230.) Haly Abbas recommends cold water or snow' also Ai-meman earth with vinegar, and other appHcations of the same nature. (Pract. iv, 34.) Alsaharavius mentions the same remedies as Haly, but expresses himself sceptical as to their efficacy. (Pract. xxx, 2, 29.) Rhases, among other applications mentions a composition of camphor and vinegar; and another contaimng- opmm, henbane, and camphor, to be used along with a cloth moistened in snow-water. The Arabian winters on hus- bandly also recommend the composition from maJlows and oil as a preservative of the face and hands from the stings of bees and wasps. (Casiri, Bibl. Arab. Hisp. 335.)

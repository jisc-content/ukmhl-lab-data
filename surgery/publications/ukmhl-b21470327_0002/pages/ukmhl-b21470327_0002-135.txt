ULCERS. SECT. XLVIII.] 119 Commentary. Avicenna condenses all the information Comm. contained in the authors who preceded him. He sets out with stating that the class of medicines which are applicable in such cases are the abstergents; of which he enumerates verdigris, stavesacre, the scales of copper, and even arsenic. Among the less active ingredients he mentions, Hke our author, the fat of asses. We need not give extracts from the other authorities, as no one has treated of this case so fully as Avicenna. SECT. XLVIII. ON SINUOUS ULCERS. When the skin adjacent to an ulcer is not united with the parts below, we caU such a complaint a sinus. When, there- fore, the sinus extends upwards, the ichor readily flows out from the sore, and adhesion easily takes place; but when it extends downwards the ichor by remaining within corrodes the continuous parts, and unless you first make an incision for its discharge, you will be able to effect nothing; for the sores can neither be mcarnated nor the parts made to unite. But if the smus is in any of thfc limbs, as the arms or legs, one may pro- duce adhesion without a counter-division by putting the limb m a declining position. Thus when the sinus is in the arm and the mouth of the sore is near the elbow, by placing the hand m an elevated position, you will render the discharge from > the ulcer below easy. And when the sinus is in the thigh : and has its outlet near the knee, you must make the position declming by putting a soft pillow below the back part of the Knee, so that the groin may be in a lower position than the Knee; and if the smus does not require incarnation, forthwith by means of a straight and hollow pipe having a bladder attached to it synnge it with honey so diluted with water that one could nTn;.; 1 *° '''^^y ^^"^ tiie sinus.

COLD WATEE. SECT. LXV.J kfVvicenna (iv, 6, 1, 31.) 243 SECT. LXV. —ON DOMESTIC ARTICLES, SUCH AS WINE AND COLD WATER. Cold water when drunk in a great quantity, and much undHuted sweet wine, more especially after the bath, running, or violent exercises, bring on suflFocation and pains. In such cases, venesection quickly had recourse to, and evacuation by clysters, remove the impending danger. Commentary. Galen says, " Some by taking an immode- rate draught of cold water have been instantly seized with dyspnoea, convulsions, and tremors; in a word, their whole nervous system has become affected." (Meth. Med. ix, 5.) Dioscorides, Aetius, and Actuarius concur in recommending • the same mode of treatment as oui- author. The Arabians however, treat those who have taken a draught of cold water : unseasonably in a very different manner from the Greeks. Thus Khases and Avicenna recommend undiluted wine inter- 1 naUy, and the application of a plaster over the liver. The dif Iference between the practice of the Greeks and Arabians may 1 be thus accounted for. A large draught of cold drink may f either threaten to prove fatal at once by producing a violent im- ipression upon the nerves of the stomach, or it may superinduce ^symptoms resembling those of gastritis. In the former case :the practice of the Arabians may seem most proper in order to ^ support the heat and powers of the system, whereas that of the Greeks will be indicated when inflammatory symptoms have come on; and, indeed, even the Arabians bled under these cir- f ^umstances. (Avicenna, iv, 61, 31.) For an immoderate draught pure wme which has been taken unseasonably, the Arabian luthonties concur with the Greek in recommending immediate evacuation of the stomach and venesection, to which they add fjold water or whey, with troches of camphor.

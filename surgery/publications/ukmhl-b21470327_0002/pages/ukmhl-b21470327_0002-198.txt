[book v. 182 H^MORRHUS. Comm. kedusu duvus. {iv, 6, 3.) Isidorus says, " Chelydros serpens ' • ' qui et chersydros dicitur quia et in terris et in aquis moratur." (Origines.) VirgU translates Nicander's account of this serpent into verses of inimitable spirit and elegance. It will be remarked by the curious reader that be mixes up together circumstances col- lected from Nicander's separate descriptions of the chelydros and dryinus. (Georg. iii, 435.) Though critical emendation of the text of ancient authors be foreign to the design of this work, we cannot omit the present opportunity of stating that, from a comparison of the descriptions given by the Greek and Latin poets, we are inclined to think that the 434th line of Virgil should run thus : Saevit agris asperque siti atque extenitus oestro.

Those bitten by the hsemorrhus experience violent pains, and both longitudinal and lateral contractions of the porous parts of the body, occasioned by the persistence of the pains. From the bite there is a copious discharge of blood, and if there happen to be a sore on any part of the body it bursts out and discharges blood. The alvine evacuations likewise are bloody, and the; blood which is evacuated is thrombous. When they cough they

SECT. XVIII.] 55 ABSCESSES. cocted swellings. And pitch, more especially the liquid, con- cocts all hard and unconcocted swellings, when added to the cataplasms. A compound medicine for j)rocuring the dischai-ge of the concocted matter of abscesses, so that often the pus is found on the pledget; and for thoroughly discussing what is not concocted: of pyrites, of levigated ammoniac, of each, dr. xij ; of the flour of beans, dr. vj; add to liquid pitch, and spread upon skin, and apply.

But equal parts of dry pitch and Cretan bee-glue, produce the rupture of ab- scesses and promote cicatrization.

CORIANDER. 210 [book v. Comm. extremities. Avicenna and Haly Abbas recommend the theriac and antidote of Mitliridates. Rliases speaks highly of milk. (Contin. ult.) The general remedies which they all recommend are emetics, vinegar, milk, sweet wine, and at last, vegetable stimulants, such as mustard and onions, and the theriac. See an account of the different varieties of henbane known to the ancients in Dioscor. (iv, 64.) ; Galen (Med. Simpl. ; Phny (H. N. xxv, 4); and in Schulze (Toxicol, vet. 20.) See also the Seventh Book of this work. The Arabians, in this place, treat of another narcotic to which they give the name of Demfitum or Barfion. See Avicenna (iv, 6, 1, 4); Rhases (xxxix.) f SECT. XXXIX. ON CORIANDER. Coriander from its smell cannot be mistaken. When dinink it renders the voice thick, and brings on madness like that from intoxication. Wherefore those who have taken it talk obscenely, and the smell of the coriander is perceptible from the whole body. They are reheved after the removal of the poison by common oil or that of iris (as mentioned above), by undiluted wine with wormwood and drank by itself; by eggs emptied into one vessel and triturated with brine and swallowed; and brine also may be drunk, and salt broth from a hen or <a goose, and sweet wine taken with lye. Comm. COMMENTARY. According to Nicander, the symptoms are ' Adolent dehrium, and great derangement of the mind, as in m- toxication. His remedies are principally emetics and ynne, the intention of giving which is quite obvious. Dioscondes gives nearly the same account of the symptoms and treatment. Galen (de Simp. Med. viii) attacks Dioscorides in the most unmeasured terms for saying that the action of coriander is frigorific,while, on thecontrarj',hemaintains that itis calefacient. Avicenna combats the reasoning of Galen and agrees with Dioscorides ; as do Apuleius among the Latins, and Alsaharavius and Rhases among the Arabians. Pseudo-Macer calls it a cold austere medicine.

STRUMA. SECT. XXXIII.] 91 Alsahai-avius directs us to procure evacuations of black bile. Comm. and gives prescriptions for various emolKent and discutient applications. When the usual remedies do not succeed, he advises recourse to be had to the operation. Ehases di\ddes scirrhus into two varieties, that accompanied with sensibility, and that which is insensible. He mentions that Antyllus approved of extii-pation and the actual cautery when the disease is of a coiToding and cancerous nature. XXXIII. ON STRUMA OR SCROFULA. Stmmse are indurated glands forming principally in the neck, armpits, and groins. Their general treatment therefore is the same as that for scirrhus, but in particular the flour of bitter lupines is to be boiled in oxymel and applied (this also answers with phyma;) or apply cows' dung boiled in vinegar. THs discusses all indurated swellings. But struma may be properly discussed by means of quicklime mixed with honey, the sordes of baths, oil, or axunge; or, equal parts of quick- lime and natron, and four times the quantity of cardamom and fenugreek may be boiled with honey for an emollient ointment and appHed.

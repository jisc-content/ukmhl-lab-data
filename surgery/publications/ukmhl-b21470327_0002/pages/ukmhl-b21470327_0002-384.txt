HYDROCELE. 368 [book VI. Comm. affirm that lie makes mention of the seton as a mode of cure ; —'—' but if this assertion be correct we have not been able to find out the passage in which he does so. Aetius gives a very distinct account of the nature of hydro- cele, but his description of the operation is by no means so accurate as our author's. He trusts mostly to astringent and desiccative apphcations. (xiv, 22.) Albucasis describes the operation in nearly the same terms as Paulus. His operation consisted of making an incision in the swelling and dissecting out the coats of the testicles. The dressings which he recommends are similar to those mentioned by our author. He also describes the operation by the cautery in nearly the same terms as Paulus. He adds, that if the patient be timid and do not choose to submit to these operations, the surgeon may let out the water either with a scalpel or the instrument used for tapping in dropsy. He states, however, that after this operation the water will collect again. (Chinu-g. ii, 62.) Avicenna briefly describes the operation of opening the tumour, and applying cauteries or strong medicines to the membranes, (iii, xxii, i, 6.) Haly Abbas directs us to open the tumour, and cut out its tunics, and then to apply incarnative dressings. This treatment, he adds, the moderns prefer to the escharotic applications used by the ancients. (Pract. ix, 47.) He also describes the pro- cess of burning. (Pract. ix, 79.) Ehases describes the operation of puncturuig the scrotum for hydrocele. He also speaks of burning the part with a slender rod of iron, and of cutting out its tunics. (Cont. xxiv.) The membrane called tunica adnata in our translation is the " ima tunica" of Celsus, and the " panniculus proprius" of the Arabian translation of Albucasis, and seems to be the same as the tunica albuginea of modern anatomists. Sprengel gives an excellent history of the operation of hy- drocele. (Hist, de la Med. 18, 8.) ^

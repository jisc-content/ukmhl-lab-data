ENTEROCELE. 373 SECT. LXV.] for it is attended with pain, and sometimes with rumbling of wind upon pressure. The peculiar symptoms of hernia from distension are, that it does not occur suddenly, but gradually; that it falls down occasionally from any ordinary causes; that the swelling appears equable and deep-seated, the protruded i intestine being surrounded by the peritoneum. In those from 1 rupture the descent at first is sudden, and happens only from violence; the sweHing is very large, and appears seated super- ; ficially immediately under the skin, owing to the intestines i having burst through the peritoneum. If the omentum alone : falls down to the scrotum in rupture of the peritoneum the aflfec- I tion is called epiplocele, but if intestine descend along with it, it is named epiploenterocele; and if water be contained in the t tunica vaginalis it receives an appellation compounded from all {the three. But neither these nor the intestinal hernia from J rupture of the peritoneum are proper subjects for surgery, but '-we operate upon enterocele alone from distension, in the fol- 1 lowing manner: after placing the patient in a recumbent pos- t ture, and getting the skin in the groin stretched by an assis- t tant, we make a transverse incision, cutting as in the operation I of angiology (but some make the incision not transverse but I longitudinal), then having transfixed it with hooks we stretch (Out the incision to such a degree as to afi'ord room for the t testicle to pass through j then passing through the inner skin ; a number of hooks proportionate to the size of the wound, and I dissecting the membranes and fat with a bhnd hook or scalpel •we cut them across. When the peritoneum is everywhere lilaid bare, introducing the index-finger at the back part of the sscrotum between the darti and peritoneum, we free the posterior rprocess (epididymis ?); and then with the right hand doubling tits extremity to the inside of the scrotum, and at the same jtime stretching the peritoneum in the left hand, we bring the •testicle with the vaginalis tunica to the incision, and give Idirections to one assistant to stretch the testicle, whilst we, having completely cleared the posterior process, ascertain by the fingers whether a fold of intestine be comprehended in the drunica vaginahs, and if so we must press it down to the belly; Ifchen we take a large-sized needle containing a doubled thread lof ten pieces, and we pass it through the middle at the extre- anity of the peritoneum close to the incision; and cutting tliQ

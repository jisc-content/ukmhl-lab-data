SECT. XLI.] HEMLOCK. 211 With regard to the treatment, the Arabians recommend oily Comm. emetics, Avith soda, pepper, salt, strong wine, &c. Avicenna (iii, 6, 2, 8); Rhases (Cont. xxi); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxx. 2.) Schulze is satisfied that the corion or coriandrum of the ancients was the same as our coriander.

Schulze finds some difficulty in acknowledging that the tplantago psyllium, L. is the true psylHum of the ancients, and ryet he admits that no other plant has so good a claim to be identified with it. We see no grounds for scepticism on this point. sect. XLI. ON CONIUM OR HEMLOCK.

At first itherefore, as in other cases of poisoning, we must bring it up *y vomiting, and afterAvards, by means of an injection, evacuate whatever part had passed into the intestines; and then, as our -reat remedy, we have recourse to undiluted wine, giving it at â– ntervals, dming which we must administer the milk of cows I 1

THORNS, diseased, sometimes the flesh which covers it heals up readily and appears sound, but in a short time a strong defluxion tak- ing place from the corrupted bone below, inflammation super- venes, and pus is formed which corrodes the cicatrix. What then is the cure of such ulcers ? Dry the diseased bone to such a degree that it may exfoliate.

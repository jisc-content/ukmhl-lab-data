SECT. CIV.] LEG. SECT. CIV. ON THE LEG. The treatment of fracttires of the leg corresponds with that I of the fore-arm, for it consists of two bones, the thicker of • which bears the same name (tibia), and the small one, from its resemblance, has been called fibula. Its fractures also admit the same varieties, being deranged on all sides when both the i bones are broken together, and to three when only one, namely, within, without, and the tibia backwards and the fibula for- ' wards. Wherefore it is to be set in the same manner by the i hands, or ligatures, sometimes applied to the leg itself, and ! sometimes to the thigh, (for the knee being a strong joint can ! bear the extension uninjured,) and ligatures are to be applied I likewise below the fracture, as we mentioned under the head of I the fore-arm. The case is to be managed otherwise, as de- ! scribed by us in the section on the arm. Commentary. Hippocrates has treated of this case at con- Comm. 5 siderable length. The bandages are to be applied as formerly I described, and the leg laid on a level board with a soft cushion 1 under it. It is clear that he did not approve of the bent posi- 1 tion of the limb. The splints are to be applied on the seventh or eleventh day. Of the fractures of a single .bone, that of the t tibia, he remarks, is the worse, a fractured fibula being easily ) managed. He gives particular directions to attend to the state I of the heel. Celsus treats of these fractures in general terms, Jike those ! of the fore-arm. Albucasis directs us to apply two splints made 1 of the wood of pines or palms, of moderate thickness, and of s such length as to extend from the knee to the feet. One of ■ t these is be placed below the leg and the other above; and they J are to be tied in three places, namely, at the extremities and in t the middle. The other Arabians treat of these fractures in more general t terms.

381 SECT, LIX.] NYMPHA. SECT. XXIX. ON HERMAPHRODITES. This affection derives its name from a combination of tlie names Hermes and Aphrodite (Mercury and Venus,) and occa- sions great deformity to both sexes. There being four varieties of it, according to Leonides; three of them occur in men and one in women. In men, sometimes about the perineum and sometimes about the middle of the scrotum, there is the ap- pearance of a female pudendum with hair; and in addition to these there is a third variety, in which the discharge of urine takes place at the scrotum as from a female pudendum. In women there is often found above the pudendum and in the situation of the pubes the appearance of a man^s privy parts, there being three bodies projecting there, one like a penis, and two like testicles. The third of the male varieties in which the urine is voided through the scrotum is incurable; but the other three may be cured by removing the supernumerary bodies and treating the part like sores. Commentary. This section of our author is copied by Albucasis (Chirurg. ii, 70); and by Haly Abbas (Pract. ix, 55.) Avicenna briefly mentions this monstrosity, (iii, 20, 2, 43.) Guy of Cauhac and Brunus describe it in the same terms as the Arabians. SECT. LXX. ON extirpation OF THE NYMPHA AND CAUDA PUDENDI. In certain women the nympha (chtoris ?) is excessively large and presents a shameful deformity, insomuch that, as has been related, some women have had erections of this part like men, and also venereal desires of a like kind. Wherefore, having placed the woman in a supine posture, and seizing the redun- dant portion of the nympha in a forceps we cut it out with a scalpel, taking care not to cut too deep lest we occasion the complaint called rhceas. The cauda is a fleshy excrescence arising from the mouth of the womb, and filling the female pu- dendum, sometimes even projecting externally like a tail; and it may be removed in the same manner as the nympha.

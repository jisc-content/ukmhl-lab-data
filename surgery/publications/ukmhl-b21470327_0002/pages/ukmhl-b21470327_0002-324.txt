308 [book vt. have recourse to sutures, and use the applications for recent wounds. M. Commentary, See all the authors referred to in the 34tli section of the Fourth Book. Galen briefly recommends incision or septic applications. He relates an unfortunate case in which an ignorant surgeon, by cutting the recurrent nerve, occasioned loss of speech. (See Meth. Med. xvi; and Loc. Affect, i, 6.) Aetius gives a long extract from Leonidas on the treatment of scrofula. His directions for dissecting out the tumours in the neck are such as experience alone could have dictated. In operating on the neck, he cautions us to avoid the jugular veins, carotid arteries, and the nerves of speech, and with this intention he recommends us rather to make the incisions lon- gitudinal than transverse. "When the tumour is small a simple incision, he says, will be sufficient; but if large, the skin is to be cut in the form of a myrtle-leaf, and the lips of the incision being stretched with hooks, the skin is to be separated from the struma with the fingers and a scalpel; but the base of the tumour is to be cut with great caution. He does not, like oiu' author, make any mention of the ligature. When there is a discharge of blood he recommends styptics, (xv, 5.) Celsus says nothing of the treatment by a surgical operation, (v. 28.) Haly Abbas, Avicenna, and most of the Arabian authorities approve of excision, and describe the operation in much the same terms as our author. Albucasis directs us when there is a large vein at the bottom of the tumour to apply a ligature roimd its root, and allow it to drop out by putrefaction. When the contents of the tumour are fluid, he recommends us to open it, and apply an ointrjient to consume the corrupted flesh; after which incarnants and detergents are to be used. When scro- fulous tumours resist the ordinary treatment, he dii-ects us to burn them with a red-hot iron.

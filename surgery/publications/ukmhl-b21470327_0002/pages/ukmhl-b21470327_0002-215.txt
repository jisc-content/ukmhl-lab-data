Like our author, he strongly commends Lemnian earth with wine as an excellent and speedy emetic. This remedy is also mentioned by Avicenna. Galen assures us that he found it an excellent emetic in various cases of poisoning. (Simpl. ix.) It consists principally of siHca, alumina, and oxyde of iron. Avicenna directs us to give immediately as an emetic, oil of sesame or oHve oil, impregnated if possible with the virtues of dill, and afterwards to use demulcents, such as the decoction of hnseed, melted butter and milk.

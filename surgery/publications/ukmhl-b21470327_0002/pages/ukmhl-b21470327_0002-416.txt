[nooK VI. 400 FISTULiE IN ANO. and to have terminated only deeply in the fundament, and if upon examination we find that a scaly or membranous substance intervenes between the index-finger and the extremity of the sound, we must perforate it violently with the head of tlie sound, and forcing the sound through the rectum, we must again, as formerly described, cut asunder the intervening parts with a scalpel; or, having perforated the bottom of the fistula in ano with the sharp part of a falciform instrument for operating upon fistulas, we bring the instrument out at the anus, and so divide all the intermediate space with the edge of the instrument; and after the incision, having taken hold of the surrounding parts, which mostly consist of callus, with a common forceps, or one called staphylagra, we cut them out all around, avoiding the sphincter muscle ; for some cutting deep in an unskilful manner, have wounded it, from which the patient has had an involuntary discharge of faeces. Those who from timidity, avoid a surgical operation may be treated wath the ligature, as recommended by Ilippocrates. For Hippocrates directs us to pass a raw thread, consisting of five pieces, through the fistula by means of a probe having a perforation, or a double-headed specillum, and to tie the ends of the thread and tighten it every day until the whole intermediate substance between the orifice be divided and the ligature fall out. If it remain long, the thread may be sprinkled with the detergent powder called psarum, or some such powder, and drawn in. Some insert a thread-into the opening of the falciform instru- ment for operations on fistulse, and pass it through in the manner described, which I think ought not to be done. For by avoiding an operation, in addition they incur the incon- venience of a slow recover3^ With regard to blind fistulaj, Leonides says: " When the fistula is deep, and penetrates the sphincter, whether beginning in the fundament, or arising from a distance and terminating in the sphincter, after the examina- tion which has been described, we dilate the anus as we do the female vagina, "with the instrument for that purpose, or the small specillum. When the orifice of the fistula is discovered, the end of an ear-specillum is to be passed tlu'ough it, and pushed deep into it, and cutting down upon it where it pre- sents, the whole fistula is to be dinded with a semispathula or a spathula for operating upon fistulsc."

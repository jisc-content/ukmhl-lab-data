Avicenna and Rhases give very proper directions about re- moving spiculse of bones, and applying slack bandages, but they evidently copy from Hippocrates and our author. SECT. CVIII.

When bones heal distortedly by callus, no little lameness takes place, more particularly if in the feet. The method then

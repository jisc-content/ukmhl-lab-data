The flesh being bruised by some weight falling upon it, and the small veins in it being ruptured, blood is poured out from them by exhalation, and collecting under the skin, is called ecchjnnoma. When the skin is not divided, a soft yielding tumour is the consequence; it is pale, and for the most part unattended with pain. Our object, therefore, is to discuss the contained blood, and that quickly, before it become black j and at first, astringents are to be mixed with the dis- cutients, because the bruised coats of the veins stand in need of condensation. After these things, we must use those ap- plications which are merely discutient without astringency. And by scarifying the ecchymomata at the commencement, we may thus apply the subsequent treatment. For chronic cases of ecchymoma, radish in the form of a cataplasm is a suitable remedy, but it must be taken away when it becomes pungent; or a cataplasm of the juice of radish with crumbs of bread, may be applied. The diseases called hypopion and hyposphagma, are species of ecchymosis, and also the eflFusion of blood below the nail from a blow; of these, the first two are treated of in their proper places in the Third Book; and the affection of the nail will be handled in the Surgical part of the work. Commentary. This is taken almost word for word from Comm. Oribasius (Synops. vii, 14); Aetius directs us to scarify the ' part affected with ecchymosis, and then to apply to it the in- side of citrons (xiv, 68.) A\'icenna approves of scarifications, provided the exti-avasated blood cannot be got otherwise removed, (iv, 4, 3, 3.)

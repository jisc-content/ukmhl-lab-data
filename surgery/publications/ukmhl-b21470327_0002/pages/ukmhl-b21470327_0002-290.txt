[book VI. ACllOGHORDON. 274 Comm. ment, and when the incision is large and the lips thereof se- ' " ' parated, we unite them with a suture, and have recourse to some plaster. But if it be small we omit the suture and effect the cm'e in the same manner otherwise. But if the chalazion be internal, so as to appear through the cartilage, having turned the eyelid outwards, and divided it transversely within, we ex- tract it and use an injection of salt water. CoMMENTAEY. Actius says that the contents of the chala- zia, in some cases, resemble the white of an egg. These he directs us to open, and, having evacuated their fluid contents, to touch the part with a powder consisting of verdigris, burnt copper, and other such escharotics. When the contents are harder he recommends complete excision, like our author, (vii, 83.) Celsus describes the mode of operating with his usual terse- yiess :â€”" HfEC incidi debent, si sub cute sunt, ab extei-iore parte, si sub cartilagine, ab interiore, dein scalpelli manubrio deducenda ab integris partibus sunt." (vii, 7.) The descriptions of the operation given by Albucasis and Haly Abbas, if not literally copied ft'om our author, are al- together to the same effect. Ehases and Avicenna approve most of the treatment by me- dicines. See Book Third. Jesu Hah directs us to avert the eye- lid and extract the tumour. Fabricius ab Aquapendente says that the fluid contained in the chalazion (gresle) is " blanche et transparente, en quelque fa9on comme de la gresle." He repeats the directions given by Celsus. (CEuv. Chir. ii, 11.) The chalazion is evidently an encysted tumour of a soft nature, and is not identical with the hordeolum, as Scarpa makes it to be. The treatment here recommended is such as admits of no improvement. SECT. XVII. ON ACROCHORDON AND ENCANTHIS. Acrochordon of the eyehd and that tumour at the greater canthus called encanthis we seize with a flesh forceps, and cutting them out with a scalpel, apply levigated chalcitis.

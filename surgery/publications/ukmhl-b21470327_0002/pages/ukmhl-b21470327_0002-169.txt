SECT. LIX.] WORMS. J53 Rhases says that the dracunculus takes place in hot and squaHd bodies, and is formed by the use of potherbs and fruits He recommends gradually increased doses of aloes, and when the animal protrudes it is to be wrapped round a leaden reed one di-. m weight, so that it may be dragged out graduaUy He cautions us not to leave any part of it in the body He also approves of incision as described by our author In his ' Contmens^ he collects the opinions of Galen, Paulus, and others. He says that it forms most commonly in the bodies of persons who bathe frequently, and drink much wine He says that he had seen it extracted by making free incisions See an mterestmg account of the guinea-worm in No 66 of the ^Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal,' by Mr Scott, surgeon, Madras. Bertapaha, Guy of Cauliac, and aU the early modern writers on medicme, repeat the ancient accounts of the vena civihs vel medine They direct us to extract it by attaching a smaU piece of lead to its extremity. Ambrose Pare adopted Galen's notion, that it is corrupted animal matter; but Andry held that It IS a real animal. It appears, however, from some state- iments which we have seen in the periodicals of the day that .some of our English surgeons in the East Indies stiU advocate tthe doctrine of Galen; but we are inclined to think that the dother opmion is the more correct one.

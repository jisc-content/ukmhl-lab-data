[book v. WASPS AND BEES. 168 SECT. IV. FOE THE BITES OF DOGS THAT ARE NOT MAI). On tlie bites of dogs that are not rabid, as even in this case they possess some poisonous quality, immediately sprinkle some vinegar, and strike the bite with your hand spread out, and then having rubbed nitre with vinegar, pour it from above upon the part. Afterwards, having soaked a new piece of sponge in vinegar or in the vinegar and nitre, apply it for three days, and moisten it; for it will effect a complete cui'e.

When the bites have already suppurated, apply the flour of tares mixed with honey, for it is particularly apph- cable. When they are inflamed anoint with litharge triturated with water. Comm. COMMENTARY. See Rhases (ad Mansor. viii, 9; Cont. xxxv); Haly Abbas (Pract. iv, 28) j Alsaharavius (Pract. xxx, 3, 31). Haly adopts the treatment laid down by our author. Alsaharavius recommends a composition of fat, wax, pitch, and galbanum. SECT. V. ON WASPS AND BEES. Those who have been stung by bees experience pain, red- ness, and swelling in the wound, the surrounding parts become tumefied, and the sting remains in the wound ; and those stung by wasps experience all the other symptoms, and that in an aggravated degree, only the sting does not remain. Both cases are remedied by rubbing the parts with clay, or cow's dung, or with the juice of figs, or with the tritiu-ated leaves of sycamore, or of mallows ; or by applying a cataplasm of barley flour mixed with vinegar. Foment also with brine or sea- water.

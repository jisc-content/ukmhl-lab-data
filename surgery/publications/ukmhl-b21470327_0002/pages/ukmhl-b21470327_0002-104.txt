88 SCIRRHUS. [book IV. SECT. XXXI. ON RUPTURE AND TEARING OF THE FLESH. Rupture is altogether attended with ecchymosis. It is cured by medicines whicli are moderately heating, as the acopon from black poplars, and such as resemble it. But when the rupture is deep-seated, we must have recourse to such remedies as are more acrid and cutting. The use of the cupping instrument is likewise beneficial to them. Should therefore the whole ecchymosis be discussed, the separated flesh readily unites ; but if it continue a long time, and sordes form under it, the ruptured flesh can no longer unite; and we must only apply the lips together, so that a small occasion may readily separate them, and that the intermediate space may be filled with some moisture, and in a certain manner an ecchymosis may be formed as at the commencement, except that it is sooner discussed, as containing a thin humour, whereas that at the commencement was formed of blood. Vulsion takes place when certain fibres are torn asunder, and it only requires soothing applications until the pain is removed j for they cannot be made to coalesce. Wherefore, the round birthwort, if any, is a convenient application to ruptured and torn parts; and in like manner, the root of the large centaury, and the juice of it, rhubarb, costus, and bdellium, drunk with oxymel. Comm. COMMENTARY. These remarks are taken from Aetius (xiv, —-—' 69, 70); or Oribasius (Synops. vii, 14); and they are copied by Nonnus (Epit. 254); and Actuarius (Meth. Med. ,iv, 16.) The Arabians treat these accidents upon exactly the same principles. See in particular Avicenna, as quoted in the pre- ceding section. SECT. XXXII.^—ON SCIRRHUS. Genuine scirrhus is a preternatural swelling, hard and devoid of sensibihty; but that which is not genuine is only attended with diminished sensibility. That which is wholly insensible, then, is utterly incurable; but that which is attended only

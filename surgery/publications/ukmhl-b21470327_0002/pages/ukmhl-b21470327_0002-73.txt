When the abscess is fairly formed, the most of these symptoms are diminished, the pungent pain be- comes itchy and somewhat dull, the sweUing is more sharpened into an acute point, is soft and yielding to the touch, and the skm at the top is separated ; I speak with regard to those that burst externaUy. If therefore, it has burst spontaneously, or from medicines, it is to be cured by means of pledgets spread with ointment, the pus being evacuated by degrees ; but if not It IS to be opened in the manner to be described in the surgical part of the work. Commentary. All the writers referred to in the last Chap- Comm ter may be consulted on the treatment of abscesses. See espe- ciaUy Aetius. He recommends when suppuration is not taking place properly to apply barley meal, or bread boiled in the Ae- coction of figs, to which if necessary may be added nitre, tur- pentme, or the like. When suppuration takes place, the abscess IS to be opened where the skin is thinnest. (See Book 6 ) The mcision is to be made long and narrow, and if any putrid substance appear it is to be cut out.

When the ulcer is foul, turpentine and honey will serve for cleaning it; or applications containing verdigris may be used for the same purpose. After the nice?

For producing rupture of the abscess, he recommends vanous applications, such as ammoniac, and niti-e triturated with W Galen ^"^"""^''^ ^^^^^ in !^7"*^7^*/^^o^^ended by Celsus is nearly the same ration^?

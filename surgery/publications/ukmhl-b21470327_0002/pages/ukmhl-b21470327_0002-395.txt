379 SECT. LXVIII.] CASTRATION. Avicenna speaks of astringent applications and the actual Comm. cautery, but disapproves of the incision and suture, (iii, 22, 1.)

LXVIII.—ON CASTRATION. The object of our art being to restore those parts which are in a preternatural state to their natural, the operation of castra- tion professes just the reverse. But since we are sometimes compelled against our will by persons of high rank to perform the operation, we shall briefly describe the mode of doing it. There are two ways of performing it, the one by compression, and the other by excision. That by compression is thus per- foniied : children, still of a tender age, are placed in a vessel of hot water, and then when the parts are softened in the bath, the testicles are to be squeezed with the fingers until they dis-

PRETERNATURAL FINGERS. 329 SECT. XLIII.] substances, which may give rise to inflammation and dis- turbance, lie below. The treatment may be conducted by means of leeks applied with pounded saltSj and the rest of the treatment of eschars. Afterwards we may use the hand cautiously. Commentary. Hippocrates (as stated by our author) re- Comm. commends this operation for preventing the recurrence of dis- '—•—' location at the shoulder-joint: it is minutely described by him. (De Artie, xi.) Albucasis describes the operation, but it will be readily understood from our author's account of it. (Chirurg. i. 27.) It is described in like manner by Haly Abbas. (Pract. ix. 73.) SECT. XLIII. ON PRETERNATURAL FINGERS, AND ON PERSONS HAVING SIX FINGERS. Preternatural fingers are formed in the hand sometimes near the thumbs, and sometimes near the little finger, but rarely beside any of the others. Of preternatural fingers, some are wholly fleshy, and others have bones in them, and sometimes they have likewise nails. Of those having bones, some derive their origin from a joint, having a common articu- lation with some other finger; and some arise from the phalanx, and these have no motion. The others sometimes have motion. Now the excision of those which are fleshy is easy, for we cut with a scalpel the preternatural finger all through. But on those which have their origin from a joint the attempt is more difiBcult. Of those which arise from the phalanx we must first cut away the flesh all around to the bone, and as to the bone itself we either chop it through with a chisel, or remove it by saAving; and in the treatment we scrape and cicatrize them as mentioned by us with regard to the wounds of bones. Commentary. Gaien (de Dift'. Morb. 4,) and Avicenna Comm. (Cant, i, 2,) allude to the preternatural growth of fingers, Haly Abbas describes the operation in the same terms as our author.

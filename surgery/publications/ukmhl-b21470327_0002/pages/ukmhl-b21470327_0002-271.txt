^ECT. v.] ANGIOLOGY. 255 (de Morbis in Homine, c. 49) recommends us to open the tem- poral veins for obstinate headaches; and, if this does not effect a cure, he directs us to burn them. Celsus describes both operations very distinctly. He directs IS to apply a ligature round the neck, so as to make the vessels sweU, and then, having marked the course of the vessels with mk, to remove the ligature, and open the veins. When a sufficient quantity of blood is discharged, the part is to be burnt \\-ith slender irons cautiously about the temples, for fear of u-ounding the temporal muscles, but more boldly between the forehead and the vertex, so as to produce exfoliation of a scale of the bone. He also speaks favorably of cutting the vessels n the temples and upper part of the head, (vii, 7.) Aetius gives nearly the same description as our author The part which relates to the burning is taken from Leonidas vii, 93.) Angiology is briefly described in the ' Isagoge' of Galen ^ minute description is given by Albucasis. He recommends he operation as a remedy for inveterate cases of hemicrania atarrh, and cephalsea. He du-ects us to shave the hairs about he temples, and to continue to do so untH the artery appears t IS known, he remarks, by its pulsation. When it does not ^adiiy make its appearance, he recommends us to apply a cloth nmd the patient's head, and to rub the place with a rou-h 1 Then, he says, take a scalpel, and make an incision so ^ to lay bare the arteiy, which seize with a hook, and separate .mthe surroundmg parts, and if the vessel is small, cut out a roper piece of it, and allow from three to six ounces of blood . flow.

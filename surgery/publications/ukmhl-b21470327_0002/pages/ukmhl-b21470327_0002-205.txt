(N. H. xxix, 18.) The account which Avicenna gives of these serpents is mostly taken from Aetius and our author. Agricola describes the asp to be four feet long, and of the thickness of a spear. The cerastes, he says, in other respects resemb es a viper, except that it has two or four substances on its head hke horns. Madden, a late traveUer in the East, gives a different account ot the horned serpent (coluber cerastes) ; he says that of two which he purchased from the Psylli one was a foot long, and the other a foot and a half A lancet smeared with the venom of one of them killed a dog in three hours. The French na- turalists who attended the expedition to Egypt found a viper caUed by the inhabitants, which they held to be identical with the asp of the ancients. We need have no hesitation thenm deciding that the coluber ^gyptiacus is the celebrated iasp of antiquity. That the cerastes was a variety of the asp .seems highly probable from the description which Nicander pves of both (Theriac 177 and 259.) See also Wilkinson^s ineoes, p. 378.

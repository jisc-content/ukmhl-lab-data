With regard to the treatment, if the body is plethonc, and the inflammation strong, it wHl be proper to begin with venesection; and when the body appears to be in a state ot cacochymy, purging must also be had recourse to. We must apply to the wound medicines for aUaying pain, and for increas- ing the discharge, more especiaUy if the cross incisions have not been practised.

We owe the earliest notice which we have of this disease to the poet Lucretius, who briefly mentions it in the following lines: " Est elephas morbus qui propter flumina Nili Gignitur jEgypto in media neque prseterea usquam." Celsus says that elephantiasis is a chronic disease, almost unknown in Italy, but very common in certain countries. He calls it an affection of the whole body, even of the bones. The upper part of the body is covered with frequent spots and tu- mours, the redness gradually changes to black, the skin is thickened, and covered with hard asperities like scales; the body wastes, but the face, legs, and feet swell; and when the disease is protracted, the fingers and toes become buried in the swelling, and a shght fever comes on, which finishes the patient's sufferings. Such is his description of the disease. His treatment consists in bleeding at the commencement, ab- stinence, then supporting the strength, purging, exercise, sudo- rifics, and friction. Baths are to be rarely used; fatty, gluti- nous, and flatulent articles of food are to be avoided, but wine is to be allowed, except at the beginning. The body is to be rubbed with pounded plantain. According to PHny, elephantiasis was never known in Italy / until the days of Pompey the Great, when it was imported from Egypt, and raged for a time, but soon became extinct. He describes it as affecting the face in particular with hard, rough, black maculse, which sometimes spread to the bones, the toes and fingers being swelled.

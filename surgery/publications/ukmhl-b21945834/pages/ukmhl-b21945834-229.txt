THE FACIAL NERVES. 215 the temporal bone, two cords of communica- tion are formed with the branches of the fifth nerve or trigeminus. One of these is called vidian nerve, and the other corda tym- pani. By these communications, nerves go in both directions: branches of the seventh are sent to the muscles at the back of the palate, while branches of the fifth nerve (and also of the sympathetic nerve) are brought into the interior of the ear. â€œThe respiratory nerve of the face, emerg- ing through the stylomastoid foramen, divides into many branches, and these, diverging, spread to all the side of the face. First, a branch is sent to the muscles of the outward ear; another is sent under the angle of the jaw, to the muscles of the throat. The principal nerve then passes through the parotid gland, and comes upon the face. Here the branches continue to scatter, to go upwards upon the temple, and downwards upon the side of the neck, forming on the neck a superficial plexus. The principal branches, however, go forward to the muscles of the forehead and eyelids; a branch called superior facial is sent to the muscles of the cheek and the side of the nose; while an inferior facial branch is given to the angle

APPEARANCES ON DISSECTION. 149 A semicircular cut was next made through the integument, following the course which the colon had taken downwards in the sac: this incision was continued some inches in length, when one of the testicles was exposed, and we were surprised by the sight of another distinct sac, very tense and containing fluid. By this we w'ere led to suppose, that some portion of the intestine must also have pro- truded through the abdominal ring on the right side, forming a double kind of hernia. This part was again carefully examined, but no intestine could be traced to that side: besides, the surface of this second or sup- posed sac was too regular to contain either omentum or intestine; it formed the greatest bulk of the whole tumour, and more resem- bled a hydrocele, if it was possible to conceive one to attain a size so immense.

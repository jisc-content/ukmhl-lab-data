34 MR. SHAW DISCOVERED AN conclusive of the muscularity of the urethra; but in the ample experience which I have had of passing these instruments, I have met with no other resistance than what might have been expected from the natural formation of the canal, (excepting in cases of permanent stricture,) until the point of the instrument had proceeded so far downwards, that a spasm or irregular action of the muscles, situated near the bulb, caused some temporary obstruction. This however is an action quite independent of the urethra itself • and if the fingers be placed on the perineum, the muscles there will be found to contract in a most forcible manner, producing a corresponding action in the sphincter ani. The diminished flow of urine during an attack of gonorrhoea is easily explained. Some have contended that the stream of urine is made smaller than usual, by the action of these invisible muscular fibres of the urethra; but I think a much more satis- factory explanation is this, that “ the calibre of the canal is to a certain extent diminished by the swollen state of the partsbut what is of much more consequence, the muscles of the perineum, and the detrusor urince are very irregular in their actions, on account of

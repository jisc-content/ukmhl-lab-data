THE HUMAN URETHRA. 5 two authors is remarkable; Sir E. Home strongly insisting on the muscularity of the urethra;—Sir C. Bell denying the existence of its muscular structure altogether. In forming a proper and correct decision on contrary views of any subject, more especially on questions connected with anatomy and physiology, the opinions of the best authors should be consulted separately, and we should then endeavour to shew by the investigation, which opinion best accords with facts, and what doctrine is the most rationally deducible from faithful and minute anatomical descrip- tions. To prove the muscularity of the urethra, we have the writings and authority of Mr. Hunter, Sir E. Home, Mr. Wilson, and many other authors who have copied their views on the subject.—On the other side, we have the authority of Sir Charles Bell, and several eminent British anatomists, together with that of the best ancient and foreign writers. The first work on the urethra, deserving notice, that was published after the treatise by John Hunter, is that written by Sir E. Home, in 1795. He has since favoured the profession with the publication of two other volumes, the one in 1803, the other in 1821.

ON THE DEAD SUBJECT. muscular contraction in a body almost putrid, and which had lain in the dissecting-room for many days; it must, therefore, be attributed to the natural elasticity of the parts, which is nearly as perfect after death as in the living body. Mr. Shaw accounts for the expulsion of a bougie on other grounds than the muscularity of the urethra: “The expulsion of a bougie by the natural actions of the urethra has been given as another proof, but this may also be met by an experiment on the dead body. If we distend the spongy body slightly, and then introduce a bougie into the urethra, it will be gradually pushed out. We must recollect, that when a bougie is passed in the living body, the penis is pulled up upon it. When we let the parts go, the penis recedes from the bougie, the muscles of the perineum push it out to a certain extent, and there remains so small a portion, that we can readily conceive the elasticity of the parts to be sufficient to press out the remainder of this conical instrument.” Much importance has been attached to the difficulty and resistance that sometimes occur in the introduction of a catheter or bougie; and this has been adduced as evidence quite F

THE EVACUATION OF THE FLUID. 173 fatally soon after the tumour bursts and the fluid is discharged. Cases have also occurred, where the sac has been ruptured by direct violence, and the patients have died almost immediately after the receipt of the injury. This is not to be wondered at, because the force necessary to rupture the sac would in all probability produce a concussion of the spinal marrow sufficient to account for death; and more particularly if the tumour happened to be situated on any part of the spine higher up than the lumbar vertebrae. But when the sac is carefully opened with a very fine instrument, and the accumulated fluid slowly and gradually drawn out, the patient is rendered free from the risk of any accidental injury to the part, as well as from the constitutional irritation produced by the distention and ulceration of the tumour. The successful case related by Sir Astley Cooper is exceedingly valuable, as proving to what an extent the parts became changed by his judicious management; and the dissec- tion of the case now under consideration, proves the efforts of nature to produce a thickening and consolidation of the sac.

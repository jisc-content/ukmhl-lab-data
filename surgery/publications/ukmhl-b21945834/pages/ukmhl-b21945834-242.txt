ON THE FUNCTION OF 228 pressure on the seventh nerve was sufficient to paralyse the muscles of the side of the face. The disease of the hone at one time affecting the fifth nerve, and producing excessive pain of the face without paralysis; at another, affecting the seventh nerve, and inducing paralysis without pain, are now phenomena accounted for. Cases of partial paralysis must be familiar to every medical observer. It is very fre- quent for young people to have what is vulgarly called a blight, by which is meant, a slight palsy of the muscles on one side of the face, and which the physician knows is not formidable.â€”Inflammation of glands seated behind the angle of the jaw will sometimes produce this; before these obser- vations, it would have been said, that paralysis could not be so produced, because the parts are plentifully supplied by branches of the fifth nerve. All such affections of the respiratory nerve will now be more easily detected; the patient has a command over the muscles of the face, he can close the lips, and the features are duly balanced; but the slightest smile is immediately attended with distortion, and in laughing and crying the paralysis becomes quite distinct.

ON THE FACIAL NERVES. 230 duced after severe accidents, as gun-shot wounds, and after great surgical operations. “ These circumstances are stated to prove, that the subject of expression is not foreign to medical studies; and certainly, by atten- tion to the action of the muscles of the face, we shall find the views drawn here from the anatomy farther countenanced. We learn, that smiling is an affection of the nerve of respiration on the muscles of the face, and that when laughter shakes the sides, it is only an extended and more convulsive action of the muscles produced by the same class of nerves. When to the paleness and cold- ness, and inanimation of grief, there is added the convulsive sob, and the catching of the throat, and the twitching of the lips and nostrils, we discover the same class of nerves to be affected, which, in crying, are only more obviously in operation, producing more violent contractions.” FINIS.

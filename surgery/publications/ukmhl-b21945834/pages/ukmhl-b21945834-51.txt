PREVENTION AND CURE OF STRICTURES. 37 deny) such fibres to exist, as described by Sir E. Home, their structure is so inconceiv- ably minute that whatever degree of spasm takes place in the urethra, cannot be attributed to their action, and that the impediments to the introduction of an instrument must depend upon other causes. The subject is not to be considered merely debatable, affording grounds only for theory and speculation, and of no great practical importance; because surgeons should not tacitly acquiesce in the opinion of the muscularity of the urethra, or should deny the existence of its muscular structure, as if it were a matter of no consequence in the regulation of their practice and the treatment of those diseases incidental to the canal. The surgeon who attributes the primary cause of stricture to muscular contraction, will of course, rationally enough, proceed in his attempts to prevent that stricture “ which is at first spasmodic,” from eventually becoming permanent. This he endeavours to accomplish by the introduction of bougies, for the purpose of stretching these muscular fibres, and by the power of dilation he hopes to check the spasmodic stricture, that it does not become permanently contracted.

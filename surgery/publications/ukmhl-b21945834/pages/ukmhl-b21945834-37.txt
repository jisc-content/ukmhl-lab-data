THE STRUCTURE OF THE URETHRA. 23 of cleaning and maceration, shew a spasmodic contraction of a muscle ? Mr. Hunter was the first to give the name of Spasmodic Stricture, and he was followed by Sir E. Home, who accounts for the formation of stricture in the following lan- guage : ‘ ‘ This contraction and relaxation form the natural and healthy actions of the urethra; but as this membrane, like every other muscular structure, is liable to a spas- modic action, which produces a degree of contraction beyond the natural; and in that state the canal loses the power of relaxing until the spasm is removed. When this hap- pens, it constitutes a disease, and is termed a spasmodic stricture. While a stricture is in this stage, it is only a wrong action of the membrane of the urethra; and if the parts should be examined in their relaxed state, there would be no appearance of disease. When a portion of the urethra is disposed to contract beyond its natural easy state, this disposition commonly increases, till the part becomes incapable of falling back into a state of complete relaxation, and the canal always remains narrow at that part. In this stage, it is both a permanent stricture and a spas- modic one. It is so far permanent, that it

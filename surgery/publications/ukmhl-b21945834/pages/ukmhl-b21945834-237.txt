The preceding case may so far be con- sidered as confirmatory of Sir Charles Bellâ€™s opinions respecting the function of the portio dura, since it proves that distortion of the countenance under certain circumstances, and paralysis of the lower eyelid, resulted from some injury sustained by the nerve. It is not so conclusive with regard to the fifth pair, as none of its branches were affected by the operation; but the sense of feeling remaining as perfect in the right as in the left cheek, we are entitled to conclude that the peculiar property of this nerve is to bestow sensibility upon the skin, as well as to order the voluntary action of those muscles to which it is distributed. The detail of this case will be considered prolix, and the observations derived from it deemed, perhaps, too partial; but I have been anxious to afford a testimony (humble as it may be) to the correctness of one of the most useful discoveries ever made in the science of physiology. It is by the relation

SECONDARY PROTRUSION OF THE OMENTUM. 53 an accident which confined me to the house for some days, I was unable to attend to this case. In the mean time my partner dressed the wound, and reported to me the favourable condition of the patient. The incision was to all appearance perfectly closed in a few days; but, in consequence of straining to evacuate the bowels, on the morn- ing of the 13th the wound opened and a considerable portion of omentum wTas pro- truded. Some time elapsed before my partner could visit the patient, when he found it impossible to return the protruded omentum, which in size was as large as a billiard ball. The part became strangulated, and afterwards sloughing commenced, which gradually pro- ceeded until the 23rd, when I was again able to visit the patient. 23rd of November. There is still a small portion of omentum to separate; it hangs out of the wound, and in appearance is very like a piece of chewed brown paper. During the whole process of sloughing, up to the present time, the patient experienced not one unpleasant symptom, with the exception of retention of urine. She had no vomiting, nor pain in the bowels, and there was no occasion to give purgative medicines.

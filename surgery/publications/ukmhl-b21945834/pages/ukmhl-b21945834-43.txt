29 PRODUCED BY INFLAMMATION. For the sake of argument, let us suppose, that strictures are produced by a partial con- traction of muscular fibres, at first spasmodic, but at last becoming permanent. What can produce a permanent contraction in any muscle, but inflammation and consequent thickening and condensation ? And why should we look for this inflammation as peculiar to muscle ? Wherefore is a disease attributed to the wrong action of a certain structure, whose existence is doubted and contradicted by the best authorities, when the same morbid appearance can be much more satisfactorily explained in a different structure; as an equal degree of stricture and condensa- tion are frequently found both in the pleura and in the peritoneum ? Yet no one, I believe, will contend that these membranes are pos- sessed of muscular fibres. If the urethra were not subject to inflam- mation, and that commonly of a most active character;â€”if a mass of evidence could be adduced to prove that the majority of stric- tures, met with in practice, occurred in patients who never had any gonorrhoeal affec- tion, we then perhaps might rest satisfied with attributing the formation of strictures to a spasmodic contraction of certain muscu-

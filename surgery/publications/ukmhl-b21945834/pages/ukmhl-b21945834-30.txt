16 ON THE ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF urethra. In liis Elementa Physiologice* treating of the coats of the urethra, we find this passage, “ Eadem irritata a veneno chemica constringitur, ut tamen non sit musculosa.” If the existence of muscular fibres in the urethra was necessary for the act of passing urine, or emitting the semen, we might expect that so accurate an observer as Haller would have mentioned it; but at page 576, under the article of Mictio TJrince, he says, “ Expellitur autem, laxo semper pene, aut modice certe arrigenti, vi potissimum contractce vesicce; hinc multo altiori et longiori saltu, quam semen, cum ex magno castello, per canalem perangustam exprimatur.” Haller considers the urethra as only a passive instrument, both in the act of trans- mitting the urine, as well as ejecting the semen. Walther also held the same opinion, as may he learned from his treatise published in the Disputationes Anatomicce of Haller. The following passage is introduced as being confirmatory of his opinions on the subject. “Neque vero urethram, loco, ubi sub vesicas collo ea esse incepit, aliae carneas fibras * Vol. vii, Page 471. ▼

APPEARANCES ON DISSECTION. 148 in a direction over the pubes to the apex of the tumour, one foot two inches and three quarters. The whole of the penis was re- tracted within the integument covering the rupture ; the opening through which the urine flowed very much resembled the navel, and this gave to the tumour the appearance of an immense umbilical hernia, extending over the pubes and falling down between the thighs. One of the testicles could be distinctly felt near the surface, about the middle of the tumour, but the other was not discoverable before the parts were dissected. Although the rupture was so large as to extend generally over the pubes, and occupy both inguinal regions; it was easily ascer- tained, without making any incision, that the protruded parts came down through the left abdominal ring. The examination was commenced by dis- secting for the left inguinal canal, which was exposed, and part of the colon found passing through it greatly distended with feculent matter, but exhibiting no marks of inflamma- tion or strangulation: the latter could not have taken place, the passage being so much dilated as to give the whole hand free admis- sion into the cavity of the abdomen.

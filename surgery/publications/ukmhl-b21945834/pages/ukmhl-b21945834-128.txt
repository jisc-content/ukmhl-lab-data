114 ADHESION OF THE INTESTINE TO THE SAC. that the omentum was also firmly attached to the sides and lower part of the sac: these adhesions I was obliged to tear asunder with my finger and the handle of the scalpel, before I could expose any part of the intes- tine. The gut was at length brought into view; it presented a very livid colour, but was so firm to the touch that I should have felt no hesitation as to the propriety of replacing it within the cavity of the abdomen, when liberated from the strangulation. The stricture was produced by the neck of the sac, which was divided without much difficulty, but in attempting to return the intestine I found that its lower surface was attached to the sac through the medium of coagulable lymph and two or three membran- ous bands. These adhesions prevented the free return of the intestine, and, for a moment, I hesitated whether to remain satisfied with the division of the stricture and allow the intestine to remain in the sac, or to destroy these attachments, so as to be able to effect a reduction of the whole of the protruded parts. I resolved upon the latter plan, and having carefully divided the membranous bands, the intestine was very easily replaced within the abdomen.

PRACTICAL REMARKS ON THE CASE. 119 â–  and the sac, but also between the intestine, the omentum, and the peritoneal covering. The membranous bands, by which the intestine was connected with the sac, were particularly firm, the division of them form- ing the most difficult part of the operation. The bands, although strong and unyielding, were evidently of recent formation, as was proved by the ease with which the patient could reduce every portion of the protruded parts, previous to the occurrence of strangulation. If their formation had taken place at an earlier period, we may suppose that the patient could not have succeeded in returning the whole of the rupture, but a part of it must have remained in an irreducible state. I never before met with any membranous bands within the sac similar to those I wit- nessed in this case, either in operating on the living body, or in dissecting the parts after death; and I believe that their rapid formation is very uncommon, and seldom takes place when the intestine becomes in that condition technically termed strangu- lated. It is difficult to determine whether the peculiar inflammatory action producing these membranous connections between the

The omentum or intestines may easily descend into this pouch, and thus an omental or intestinal rupture will be superadded to the hernia of the bladder.‚Äù Some writers have considered a cystocele to be a congenital mal-formation or position of the bladder, but in the present instance such could not have been the case, because the patient had no swelling of the scrotum, and suflered no inconvenience until he was past the age of thirty.

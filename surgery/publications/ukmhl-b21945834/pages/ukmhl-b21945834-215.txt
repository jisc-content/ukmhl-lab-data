I possessed no means of correctly deciding upon the strength or extent of these connec- tions before using the knife, and it was impossible to determine with accuracy what important parts might be endangered. From the situation and great extent of the tumour most of the superficial nerves of the neck would, in all probability, be severed or injured in attempting its extirpation, parti- cularly the branches forming the superficial cervical plexus, and the descendens noni;â€” the main trunk of the portio dura, or the respiratory nerve of the face, was also liable to be tom through in detaching the tumour from the neighbourhood of the mastoid process.

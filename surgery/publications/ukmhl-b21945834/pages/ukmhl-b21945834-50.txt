Let them, however, unbiassed exa- mine the different arguments and experiments brought forward to support either side of the question: (for it is only by a diligent and impartial comparison of the different views which have been offered on the subject, that an opinion is justifiable:) let the facts of the anatomy and the physiology be taken together, let the different curious phenomena exhibited during disease be also accurately observed ; and I affirm, that he who thus unprejudiced weighs the matter, will come to reject the opinion of the muscular structure of the urethra; first, because the existence of muscular fibres in that canal is not necessary for the actions which it performs; and secondlv, because such fibres are denied by a majority of eminent authorities. I must therefore contend, that allowing (which for my own part from conviction I

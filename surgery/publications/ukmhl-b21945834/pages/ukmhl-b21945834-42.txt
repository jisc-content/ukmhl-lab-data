28 STRICTURES IN THE URETHRA urethra, posterior to a stricture, he says, “ It resembles the fibres which are formed on the peritoneum or pleura, by inflammation, and in many cases fibres are quite detached from the membrane, except at their two extremities, being similar to the bands which are occasion- ally seen running across hernial sacs.” If we examine a great number of slight strictures, very few examples of the urethra contracted into a regularly circular form will be found; but in the greater number of cases, about one-half, or two-thirds, of a portion of the urethra will have become white and dense, or a firm white line will be seen running obliquely across the passage; and yet we do not find any oblique fibres described in the natural state of the parts. We must account for the formation of stricture on other grounds than the contraction of muscular fibres, for we find by dissection, appearances which denote previous inflammation. Is it not more reasonable to attribute the formation of stricture to inflammation, and the necessary condensation produced by it, than to a contraction of muscular fibres, which certainly are not to he distinguished; this contraction being at first spasmodic, but becoming eventually permanent ?

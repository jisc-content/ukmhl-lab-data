211 THE FACIAL NERVES.- the difference of function belonging to these nerves is clearly explained; and a subject that, previous to his researches, was difficult and uninviting, now becomes simple, and affords materials for very interesting and valuable speculations. Before any practical deductions can be derived from the preceding case, it will be necessary to present the reader with a brief outline of the views entertained by Sir Charles Bell, and a summary of the conclu- sions he has drawn from a variety of facts and ingenious experiments.

In the remarks I shall venture to offer on the subject, it is my wish to direct the readerâ€™s attention more particularly to the consideration of the nerves of the face, as the difference of function of the fifth and seventh pairs is capable of illustration by the case of tumour just related. The anatomist after dissecting the nume- rous branches given off from the three subdivisions of the fifth pair, and having minutely traced all the filaments derived from the portio dura of the seventh, is at a loss to account for the seeming intricacy and confusion.

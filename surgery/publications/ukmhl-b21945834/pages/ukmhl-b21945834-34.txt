20 OPINIONS OF ANATOMISTS ON body, which conjointly seem calculated for every purpose of the ceconomy, and likely to account for every symptom which might be mistaken for spasmodic action in the canal itself. The idea of muscularity is derived from the symptoms of stricture, and the irritability of the canal. ‘ ‘ The urethra is elastic : not only allowing a very large bougie to be passed, and closing upon a thread; but it still more remarkably admits of elongation, than of distention in the width of the canal. It is surrounded, as we have seen, with a spongy body and the cellular coat, which is betwixt the delicate lining membrane of the urethra, and the spongy body partakes of the structure of both, and is very elastic. But when an inflammation attacks the canal, this cellular membrane is its principal seat: the point affected loses its elasticity; no longer stretches with the penis and urethra, but consolidates, or forms a strong membranous filament. To suppose this stricture to have been formed by the muscular contraction in the diameter of the canal, would be to allow the partial action of one or two fibres: (for the stricture is like that which would be produced by the tying of a packthread round

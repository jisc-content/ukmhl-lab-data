Home, might be doubted by the impossibility of reconciling the idea of such delicacy and minuteness of its fibres and their mucous attachments. To disbelieve, however, is not to refute; and before any great authority can be contradicted, it is necessary to bring forward the opposing testimony of others. In addition to the authors of the present day, I shall quote those who in their own time were respected, and even now must be considered of no mean authority. De Graff, in the year 1668, wrote a treatise on the Organs of Generation in the male, and has described very accurately their minute anatomical structure, but in no part of his work can be found any account of muscular fibres in the urethra; and as all his descrip- descriptions are acknowledged to be correct, and since little difference exists between the account of the individual parts given by him, and that of more modern authors, his testi- mony must certainly be considered of great value. Haller, who will always be accounted one of the greatest authorities in anatomy and physiology, denies the muscularity of the

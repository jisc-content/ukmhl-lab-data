Although the sac itself was considerably thickened, I felt distinctly that a portion of the omentum was lying uppermost, and the discovery of this gave me greater confidence in pursuing the operation. I scratched with the point of the scalpel, until the sac was divided, and a small portion of omentum protruded through the opening. I then attempted to introduce the director, but, in consequence of the close and firm adhesion existing between the sac and the omentum, I could not pass it upwards in such a manner as would leave only the sac between that instrument and the bistoury.

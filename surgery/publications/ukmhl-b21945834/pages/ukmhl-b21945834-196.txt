182 CEASING OF THE PULSATION. to become flaccid immediately after they had been secured by the ligatures; but the con- trary was the case; it was more distended and its colour assumed a darker hue. The ceasing of the pulsation can only be accounted for in the following manner.—The eflux of blood from the tumour was for a time prevented by tying those vessels through which it was principally transmitted, the sac therefore became so much distended from within that no room was left for the contrac- tion and dilatation of the arteries. The pulsation did not return until the activity of the smaller vessels had formed an anasto- mosing circulation between the tumour and the surrounding parts:—when a free egress for the blood had been established, the peculiar contractibility of the tumour recom- menced. ' Although little information, as to the real nature of this affection, has been derived from examination of the tumours after they have been removed, (all of them appearing on dissection to consist of a congeries of vessels imbedded in a soft spongy mass), the present case would lead us to consider aneu- rism by anastomosis as a tumour possessing an independant vitality;— a kind of parasitical

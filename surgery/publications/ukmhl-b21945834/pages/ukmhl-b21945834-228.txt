214 ON THE FUNCTION OF “ OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVE OF THE FACE, BEING THAT WHICH IS CALLED PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH. “This nerve does not exist, except where there is some consent of motions established betwixt the face and the repiratory organs; and this is the reason of its circuitous and prolonged course. In fishes, this nerve, instead of being distributed forward to the face, passes backward to the muscles of the gills. In fact, there is properly no portio dura of the seventh in fishes, the nerve resembling it being a branch of the par vagum. A short description of this nerve in the human body, will be necessary to our enquiry. ‘ ‘ The respiratory nerve of the face arises from the superior and lateral part of the medulla oblongata, close to the nodus cerebri, and exactly where the crus cerebelli joins the medulla oblongata. The other respiratory nerves, which form so distinguished a part of the nervous system, arise in a line with the roots of this. The nerve, passing into the internal audi- tory foramen, is here embraced by the portio mollis; but it separates from it, and is received into an appropriate canal of the temporal bone.

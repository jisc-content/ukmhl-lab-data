THE HUMAN URETHRA. 7 thinks lie has proved beyond all question the muscularity of the urethra. Page 26, he says, “the structure of the human urethra, as far as it could be examined by ordinary vision, assisted by glasses of small magnifying power, has been long known to all the anatomists of the present day; and twenty-five years ago I thought myself tho- roughly acquainted with it; but I now find that I was wholly ignorant of the more minute parts of its conformation.” And again, “from Mr. Bauer’s examina- tions we find that the human urethra is made up of two parts, an internal membrane, and an external muscular covering.” Again at page 28, “ the muscular covering by which the membrane is surrounded, or enclosed, is made up of fasciculi of very short fibres, which appear to be interwoven together, and to be connected by their origins and in- sertions with one another; they have all a longitudinal direction. A muscular structure of this description, as far as I know, is not met with in any part of the body. It is how- ever to be observed, that there is no other instance in which fibres of such minuteness have been examined, and faithfully represent- ed.” “ The fasciculi are united together by an elastic substance of the consistence of mucus”

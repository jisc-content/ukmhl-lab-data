A CRITICAL ENQUIRY INTO THE DIFFERENT OPINIONS RESPECTING THE STRUCTURE OF THE URETHRA; BEING AN ATTEMPT TO RE- FUTE THE DOCTRINES OF SIR EVERARD HOME, BART: TO WHICH ARE ADDED SOME PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE PREVEN- TION AND CURE OF STRICTURES. It may be admitted, for the sake of brevity, that only two general theories have prevailed, respecting the anatomical structure and physi- ology of the Urethra; or, at least, the nume- rous authors who have written on these sub- jects, may be divided into two classes: the one supporting, the other denying, the opinion of the muscularity of the canal. Mr. Hunter’s ideas of the formation and structure of the urethra, have given rise to most of the modern theories, (particularly of the English surgeons), relating to its physio- logy. It was the opinion of that celebrated anatomist, that the urethra is muscular; he says, “ the substance of the urethra is muscu- lar, and it is therefore capable of contracting its canal, so much so as to shut it up entirely. This makes it subject to diseases peculiar to b 2

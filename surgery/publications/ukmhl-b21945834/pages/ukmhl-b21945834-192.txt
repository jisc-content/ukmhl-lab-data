178 APPLICATION OF LIGATURES superficially in the integument, and to enter the substance of the tumour at different angles. As the whole diseased mass could not be extirpated without the removal of a large portion of integument from the forehead, where I had no opportunity of forming a flap, and as it would be attended with an unseemly mark, I determined to try the effect of ligatures upon those vessels through which the tumour apparently was supplied with blood.

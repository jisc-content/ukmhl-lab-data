ON THE FUNCTION OF 218 associated action with the other organs of respiration. These passages to the lungs are membranous tubes, moved by muscles, which serve to expand and widen them, so that air may freely enter into the lungs. It is obvious that, to produce this, these muscles must have a consent with the other muscles of respiration, and move simultane- ously with them ; and this is effected through the respiratory nerve of the face.” “The actions of sneezing and coughing are entirely confined to the influence of the respiratory nerves. When carbonate of am- monia was put to the nostrils of the ass whose respiratory nerve had been cut, that side of the nose and face where the nerves were entire, was curled up with the peculiar expression of sneezing; hut on the other side, where the nerve was divided, the face remained quite relaxed, although the branches of the fifth pair and the sympathetic were entire.

226 ON THE FUNCTION OF so happily upon the case of tumour just related, that I feel no hesitation in introduc- ing them, as they will form the best possible conclusion to the remarks I have ventured to offer : <Â£ Were we to enquire no farther, and to rest content with the inference, that the two sets of nerves distributed to the face have distinct functions; even this must prove useful both to the surgeon and physician. To the surgeon it must be useful in perform- ing operations on the face, as well as in observing the symptoms of disease. If we have to plan an incision on the face, we must take especial care to avoid cutting the branches of the seventh nerve, for then there will be paralysis of the muscles supplied by that nerve.

To produce paralysis as a consequence of an operation, which was meant to remove deformity, is a considerable mistake; but even worse consequences may result from an ignorance of the distinct nature of these nerves; if, trusting to the eyelids being supplied by branches of the

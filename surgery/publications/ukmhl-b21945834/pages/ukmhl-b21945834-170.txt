ON THE MODE IN WHICH 156 its capacity is so mucli increased, and its coats become so flaccid by repeated retentions of urine, that when emptied it is in a state which renders it quite as liable to escape from its proper situation, as either the omen- tum or any part of the intestines. In most of the cases of cystocele which have been recorded, one part of the bladder was found in the pelvis, and the other in the scrotum. In the present instance, there was a complete protrusion of the whole of the viscus, the coats of which were laminated, (so much so as to admit of division into six or seven layers,) excepting at one point, which, as I before observed, was thin and very much inflamed: if the patient had sur- vived a few days longer, there is little doubt but this point would have ulcerated and given way.

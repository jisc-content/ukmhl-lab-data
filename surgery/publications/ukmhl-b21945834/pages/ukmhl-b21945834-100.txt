86 DESCRIPTION OF THE HERNIA AND a superficial examination, it might have been mistaken for an inguinal hernia; it was not very tense, but exceedingly tender and pain- ful when touched. Conjoined with the symptoms usually pre- sent in all cases of strangulated intestine, was a very troublesome hiccough; the counte- nance indicated great anxiety and distress, and the patient expressed herself perfectly willing to submit to any thing I might pro- pose. I tried the taxis for some time, but with no success; indeed, a reduction of the protruded parts was scarcely to be expected, considering the length of time that had elapsed since the first symptoms of strangu- lation had appeared. My friend, Mr. Clarke, who accompanied me, agreed in opinion as to the propriety of an immediate OPERATION, which was performed at nine o’clock in the evening. I commenced the incision consi- derably above the line of Poupart’s ligament, and continued it downwards to the base of the tumour; another cut was made across this through the common integument. The four flaps thus made, were each raised sepa- rately, and the whole of the skin was dissected from the tumour.

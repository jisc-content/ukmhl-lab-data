It would be unjust not to allow him every praise for the great attention which he has undoubtedly given to the subject; but how far his opinions are correct, and whether he is entitled to the honour of the discovery, will be hereafter seen. The medical profession will have to decide, whether the testimony of one author, however great his reputation may he, is sufficient to outweigh an accumulated mass of anatomical evidence. Perhaps it may be urged that the opinions of ancient authors are inadmissable in a question relating to the correctness of a more recent discovery; and that in consequence of the advanced state of the science of anatomy, the observations and descriptions of early writers cannot carry with them much weight. The opinions and quotations however which I propose to offer to the attention of the reader, are from the best authorities;—from writers to whom we are indebted for a large share of that anatomical knowledge we now possess;—who have investigated the minute structure of the various parts of the

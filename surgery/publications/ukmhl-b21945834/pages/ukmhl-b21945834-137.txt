CASE OF STRANGULATED FEMORAL HERNIA COMBINED WITH PREGNANCY.—THE OPERA- TION SUCCESSFUL. Mrs. Williams, aged 36, has had a femoral rupture for five years, but never attempted to confine it by the application of a truss. She is the mother of several children, and has enjoyed good health, with the exception of occasional illness after her labours. At the present time she is nearly four months advanced in pregnancy. The hernia was strangulated about three years since, but with much difficulty I suc- ceeded in reducing it at that time; and, to prevent a repetition of the danger, I recom- mended the use of a truss. This advice, however, was not attended to. On Saturday morning, September 24th, she walked to market; after making some purchases she returned home, and was imme- diately attacked with the most violent pain in her bowels. At one o’clock my attendance was requested, and I found her suffering very acute pain in the bowels, accompanied with frequent vomiting of a dark-coloured matter.

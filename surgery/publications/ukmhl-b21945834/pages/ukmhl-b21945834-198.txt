184 DANGER OF HAEMORRHAGE. tions for aneurism by anastomosis are per- formed on infants, or children at that delicate age when the loss of a small quantity of blood, if not proving immediately fatal, will lay the foundation for many distressing affec- tions. The profuse hsemorrhage which resulted from the extirpation of the tumour in the case I have related, (although the incisions commenced at a considerable distance from its base), can be accounted for only by the general increased vascularity of the surround- ing integument, produced by tying those four large vessels, through which the blood had previously been freely transmitted. These principal vessels becoming obstructed, the smaller arteries belonging to the tumour gradually became more active, extended themselves, and conjointly performed the office of the four main trunks.

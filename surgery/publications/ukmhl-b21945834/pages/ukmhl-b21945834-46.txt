MR. SHAW’S EXPERIMENTS 32 the canal during the emission of semen is given as a proof of muscularity; but the same diminution may be produced after death, by injecting the spongy body.” This argument, if it can be called one, scarcely needs any refutation, because it must have been offered without a proper attention to the state of the parts during the emission of the semen. It must be obvious, that the turgid and enlarged condition of the vessels of the spongy body, occupy a much larger space than they do in the unexcited state of the penis ;■—the urethra being the only yielding or hollow part is consequently compressed, and this compression produces a correspond- ing degree of diminution in the calibre of the canal. One powerful argument in favour of the muscularity of the urethra, has been refuted by Mr. Shaw, namely, the expulsion of an injection in a case of gonorrhoea. Mr. S. found, that by throwing a small quantity of water into the corpus spongiosum, so as to make the penis swell, and resemble the state generally met with in a case of gonorrhoea, and on injecting the urethra “ the fluid was thrown out nearly a yard.” No one could say, that this expulsion was affected by

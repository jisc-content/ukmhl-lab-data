14 ON THE ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF their view even in a most unusually magnified state ; for such fibres as “are united together by an elastic substance, of the consistence of mucus,” must be inconceivably minute. This “elastic substance,” which unites the fasciculi together, I presume must have the same relation to those fibres where it is attached, as tendons have to muscles in gene- ral ; but the idea of a tendon of not much thicker consistence than saliva would appear ridiculous; and whether such muscles, by their contraction, could cause so great a in- sistence to the introduction of a bougie, I shall leave for others to determine. If it be true that the membrane of the urethra is of the delicate texture represented by Sir E. Home, and that its muscular fibres are connected and held together by an elastic substance, of no thicker consistence than mucus, might we not expect laceration, or some irreparable evil from every introduction of an instrument, although managed with the greatest caution and dexterity ? I would ask every practical surgeon, what would become of these fibres (invisible certainly to the naked eye,) and their gelatinous connections, in the rude and unskilful attempts to pass a bougie or catheter into the bladder?

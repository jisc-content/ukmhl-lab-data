1/0 RAPID SECRETION OF TIIE FLUID. lymph had already formed and become attached to its inner surface. There is no reason, therefore, to doubt that the parts would eventually have become consolidated, and the membranes covering the spinal marrow so much contracted as to offer an effectual resistance to any quantity of fluid that might be secreted. The reader must be aware that the present case was by no means favourable for the trial of puncturing the sac and drawing off the fluid, inasmuch as the tumour was unusually large, and the tendency to hydro- cephalus very great, as proved by the secretion and evacuation of no less a quantity than twenty-five ounces of water in the course of seven days. The rapidity with which the secretion of fluid took place, and its consequent distention of the sac, was very remarkable, for in less than six hours after each time of puncturing, the pad which had been placed in the depres- sion became gradually elevated, although kept somewhat firmly in its situation by means of the roller. I have before remarked, that after the evacuation of the fluid there was an alteration in the size of the head, which was made more

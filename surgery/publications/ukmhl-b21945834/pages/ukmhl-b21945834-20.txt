6 ON THE ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF It is to be observed that Sir Everard in- culcates the same mode of practice in affec- tions of the urethra both in his earliest and more recent publications; he always believed in the existence of muscular fibres in the canal; though it is quite evident from his work of 1795 that at the time of its publication he had no proofs afforded by investigation of the anatomy of the part, to support him in that supposition. In page 15, he says, “it may be difficult and perhaps impossible to prove this membrane to be muscular, either from its appearance or from examination of its structure.” From this passage it would appear that his views of the anatomy and principles of prac- tice as offered in his first work, were not derived from, or confirmed by, facts, but were grounded only upon the verbal authority of his predecessor, John Hunter. In the philosophical transactions of the Royal Society Sir E. Home has published some ‘£ observations on the human urethra, shewing its internal structure,” and these remarks are copied into the work which he published in 1821. In this volume Sir Everard informs us, that by the assistance of Mr. Bauer, and his wonderful microscope, he

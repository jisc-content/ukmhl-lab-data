ON THE FUNCTION OF 222 when the tumour was detached from the mastoid process. From having repeatedly witnessed experi- ments upon the fifth pair, and observed the acuteness of pain not so evident in the contractions of the muscles, as in the expres- sion of the countenance, and rendered more striking by the moans of the animal at the moment any of the branches were divided; I am inclined to suppose that if the sensibility of the portio dura was equally keen, a person of the greatest resolution, and whose feelings are under the most perfect controul, would inevitably give some peculiar demonstration of suffering when this nerve was lacerated or injured.

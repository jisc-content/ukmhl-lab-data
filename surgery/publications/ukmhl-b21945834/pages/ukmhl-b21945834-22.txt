8 ON THE ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF At page 29, “ this mechanism which forms the canal of the urethra, is very different from what it has hitherto been contemplated to he ; and therefore a knowledge of it enables us to correct many errors that we had fallen into, with respect to the actions of its parts, both in a healthy state, and when under the influ- ence of disease. Till now it was believed that either the lining of the urethra was composed of circular fibres possessed of a power of con- traction, or that it was immediately surrounded by such fibres.” It may perhaps have been the belief of Sir E. Home, that the lining of the urethra was composed of circular fibres; but after a patient and diligent research of the best authorities, I have not been able to discover that such was the opinion of many other writers of celebrity, with the exception of Mr. Hunter, and it has been shewn that even that accurate investiga- tor of the structure of the human body, was not able to discover any muscular fibres, although he believed in their existence. It is certainly true, that Camper and Le Cat have described muscular fibres in the membrane. One of these authors states that the fibres run in a circular direction, the other affirms that they have a longitudinal course. This difference of opinion between two

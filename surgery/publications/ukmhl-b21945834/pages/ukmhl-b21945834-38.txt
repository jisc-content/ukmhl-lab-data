24 SIR EVERARD HOME’S OPINIONS is always narrower than the rest of the canal; and so far spasmodic, that it is liable to contract occasionally in a still greater degree. A stricture in the urethra, whether in a spas- modic or permanent state, is a contraction of the transverse fibres of the membrane which forms that canal. When this contraction is in small degrees, it appears on examination after death, to be a simple narrowing of the canal at that part; but when the contraction is increased, it becomes a ridge, projecting into the canal: this last is the appearance understood by a permanent stricture.” The reader will he awTare of the contradic- tion contained in the foregoing paragraph : Sir Everard states, that when a stricture is in that stage which he terms spasmodic, “ if the parts should be examined in their relaxed state, there would be no appearance of diseasebut in speaking of the contraction produced by this spasmodic action, he says, “ when this contraction is in small degrees, it appears, on examination after death, to be a simple narrowing of the canal.” No one, I believe, will deny that the muscles cease to contract after death; but perhaps Sir Everard Home has discovered that these fibres of the urethra possess a

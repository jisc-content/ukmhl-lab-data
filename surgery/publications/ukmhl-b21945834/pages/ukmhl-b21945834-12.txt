INTRODUCTION. Viii-. intention to add others to them, particularly, on the subjects of Aneurism and Cancer, but finding that they would considerably increase the size of the book, and the expense of its publication, I have for the present deemed it more prudent to omit them. Should, however, this small volume meet with a favourable re- ception, I may at a future period be induced to offer some further practical observations. As an excuse for the unfinished style in which these remarks are conveyed, I can only say, that it has been my occupation to arrange the following cases, and to subjoin my observations on each, in such few and uncertain hours as have been unemployed in the duties of an arduous and somewhat extensive practice. They are, therefore, presented to the public in the diffident hope, that in some particulars they may tend to the improvement of that science to which I am most devotedly attached.

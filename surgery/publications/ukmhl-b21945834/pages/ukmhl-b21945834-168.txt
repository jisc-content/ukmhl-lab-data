154 ON THE MODE IN WHICH Lawrence, of the manner in which a cystocele is usually produced, to be perfectly correct. He says, â€œ If the bladder, either from being naturally large, or from having its capacity increased in consequence of retention of urine, is placed behind the ring when un- distended, it may be propelled through the opening just as easily as any other of the abdominal contents. In this case, a portion of the anterior surface is first protruded; and, as this is connected by cellular substance to the surrounding parts, without possessing a peritoneal covering, the rupture in this stage possesses no hernial sac. When we observe the fundus of the bladder, in retentions of urine, rising to the umbilicus or higher, not- withstanding the cellular adhesions which unite it to the pubes, we shall conclude that these connections will not prevent the rupture from increasing under the continued action of the same causes which first produced it. The neighbouring part of the fundus, or side of the bladder, where it is covered by peri- toneum, is gradually drawn through the ring, and forms a kind of hernial sac, which has a very different relation to the protruded part of the bladder, from that which the peritoneal covering bears to the contents of

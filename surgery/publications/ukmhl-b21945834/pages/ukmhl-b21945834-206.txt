192 LITHOTOMY IN THE FEMALE. an adult female, which, after great difficulty, was removed through the urethra; but, either in consequence of the extreme dilatation of the canal, necessary to admit the passage of the calculus, or from some injury done to the neck of the bladder in extracting it; the woman could never afterwards exercise any voluntary power of retaining her water, but was constantly subjected to a stillicidium urinas. This case, therefore, proves that when the female urethra is mechanically dilated beyond a certain extent, the power of retaining the urine is as much endangered as by a division of the canal and the sphincter of the bladder with a cutting instrument.

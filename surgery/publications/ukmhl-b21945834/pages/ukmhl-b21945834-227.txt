213 THE FACIAL NERVES. a branch of this nerve which supplies sensi- bility to the member. But this is only if it be a simple organ of feeling, and is not in its office connected with respiration. “From the nerve that comes off from the anterior ganglion of the leech, and which supplies its mouth, we may trace up through the gradations of animals a nerve of taste and manducation, until we arrive at the complete distribution of the fifth, or trige- minus in man. Here, in the highest link as in the lowest, the nerve is subservient to the same functions. It is the nerve of taste and of the salivary glands; of the muscles of the jaws, and of common sensibility. This nerve comes off from the base of the brain in so peculiar a situation, that it alone, of all the nerves of the head, receives roots both from the medullary process of the cerebrum and of the cerebellum. A ganglion is formed upon it near its origin, though some of its filaments pass on without entering into the ganglion. Before passing out of the skull, the nerve splits into three great divisions, which are sent to the face, jaws, and tongue. Its branches go minutely to the skin, and enter into all the muscles, and they are especially profuse to the lips.”

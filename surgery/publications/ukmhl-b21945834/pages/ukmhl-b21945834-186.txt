In some animals, as the otter and beaver, this sulcus always remains pervious, forming a ready communication between the brain and the spinal cord. It has been recorded of almost every case of spina bifida, where the tumour was allowed to ulcerate and discharge its contents spon- taneously, that the death of the patient immediately followed; surgeons, therefore, have been deterred from adopting any mea- sures for the cure of this uncommon and dangerous affection. But in my opinion, it is reasoning upon false principles to suppose that an artificial opening must be attended with the same result as follows the ulceration of the sac.

144 PRACTICAL REMARKS ON THE CASE. intestine below. The inguinal canal being so much dilated throughout its whole length, by the mechanical action of the distended colon, did not appear to form at any part a stricture on that gut, so that pressure, pro- perly applied, would certainly have reduced it. In all cases of large hernia, which have continued for years in an irreducible state, and become at length strangulated by acci- dent, it is useless to attempt a reduction of the great bulk of the tumour: the surgeon should be guided by his views and recollec- tion of the anatomy, to the part where the stricture is most likely to be seated, and direct his efforts at reduction to that parti- cular spot. If the whole circumference of the tumour be grasped with the hands, and if pressure, however great, be applied at its sides, no advantage in general will be derived from this mode of procedure; whereas, if gentle manipulation be employed at its upper part, and (if it be an inguinal hernia) in the direction of the spermatic passage, we may frequently release that part of the intestine which is directly strangulated, and relieve all the urgent symptoms without producing any considerable, or even visible, diminution in the size of the rupture.

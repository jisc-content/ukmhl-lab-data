THE HUMAN URETHRA. 11 and in the very extensive collection belonging to Sir Charles Bell, there is not one that exhibits a stricture situated in what is termed the membranous part of the urethra; and au- thors rarely mention the existence of it in that part of the canal. Sir Everard says ‘ ‘ the stricture formed in the membranous part, is, by the means of a muscle, brought round not only the tube of the urethra, but round the whole substance of the membranous portion; and when this has become permanent, the condensation and par- tial absorption of all these compressed parts, as well as of the contracted muscle itself, form a ligamentous substance so hard that the stroke of a probe across it may be heard” The authority of Sir E. Home on most subjects is certainly great; but the foregoing paragraph is really curious, and, to me, inex- plicable. I am particularly surprised at his attempt to account for the formation of stricture in a part of the urethra where the existence of stricture has been denied, not only by the best practical writers on the subject, but contradicted also by the prepara- tions in the College Museum. I shall not trouble the reader with many more quotations from Sir E. Home’s works:

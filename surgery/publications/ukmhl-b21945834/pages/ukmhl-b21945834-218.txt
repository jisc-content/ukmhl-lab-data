PARTS SEEN IN OPERATING. 204 diseased mass had been extirpated, it pre- sented a very frightful wound, extending from the thyroid cartilage to a point consi- derably behind the ear. The coagulated blood being removed, and the bottom of the wound carefully sponged, the muscles pre- sented a very curious appearance, particularly the sterno-mastoideus, the belly of which was so much flattened and compressed, that all traces of its fibres were nearly obliterated. A similar change had also taken place in the sterno-hyoideus and sterno-thyroideus mus- cles ; but the most remarkable effect of the growth of the tumour was evident in the altered form and size of the lower jaw. The upper part of the tumour was prevented from projecting outwards in consequence of the firm and unyielding nature of the fasciae covering it, and in the progress of its enlarge- ment the ramus of the jaw was subjected to gradually-increasing pressure, the effect of which produced very considerable absorption and decrease in the thickness of the bone. Part of the submaxillary gland was exposed in the wound, and the inferior lobe of the parotid was laid bare. The tumour had formed stronger connections in the neigh- bourhood of the mastoid process than at any

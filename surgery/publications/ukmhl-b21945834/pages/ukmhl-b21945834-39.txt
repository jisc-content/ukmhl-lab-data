A very obvious question must arise from the discussion of this subject; viz. of what use would a muscular structure in the urethra be for the act of passing urine, or emitting the semen ? For the passing of the urine, it is necessary that a certain regular and uniform consent of parts should be established, whereby a relaxation of some muscles may be produced, in order that the contraction of others should have a due and proper effect. The urethra, in the act of passing urine, is in a passive state, the urine being propelled by the muscular coat of the bladder. If the urethra contracted, or assisted the expulsatory force of the bladder, the urine could never flow, as it does flow in the healthy state of the canal, in a free and uninterrupted stream. The passage of urine through the canal of the urethra, if it were muscular and possessed an independent power of contraction, would, in all probability, resemble the flow of arterial blood, which we know escapes from an artery in jets or distinct pulsations. Are the same phenomena ever observed in the act of passing urine ? Does it not flow in an equal E

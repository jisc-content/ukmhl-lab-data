On the other hand, we have the authority of Mr. Travers, wTho cured an aneu- rism by anastomosis, situated in the left orbit, by tying the carotid artery. This case proves that the growth of the tumour may occasionally be checked, and the affection cured, by diminishing the supply of blood which it receives from some important vessel. In all cases, however, where the tumour can be removed with safety, excision is to be preferred to any other method of treat- ment; and the necessity of it was strongly advocated by Mr. John Bell, who, in speak- ing of the affection, says, “ The whole group of vessels must be extirpated.” It should be recollected, in performing this operation, that the danger of haemorrhage is great when the knife is laid very close to the base of the tumour; but if the incision be made at some distance round it, the quantity of blood lost will in general be trifling, and the bleeding easily restrained. The importance of this fact will be admitted, when we consider that the majority of opera-

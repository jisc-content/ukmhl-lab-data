15 GENERAL matter of fact it is very inferior for this purpose. Owing its power of drainage to its capillary action, it drains ordinary fluids such as water or saline well; but as blood rapidly coagulates, covering the gauze with a film of clot, it destroys this action. Therefore a gauze wick keeps a wound open, but it acts more as a cork than as a course for drainage. It should be used for small shallow wounds that will not retain an india-rubber tube, but then only a thin, narrow piece should be employed, placed at one end of the wound, and not inserted with the idea of plugging but of keeping it open, so that discharges can escape from the wound alongside the wick. Gauze drains should be removed or changed within twenty- four hours. India-rubber tubes are in nearly all instances the most satisfactory form of drainage. They should have lateral openings in the portion which is situated inside the wound. To prevent the tube slipping into the wound, the end outside is transfixed with a sterilized safety-pin, or united to the skin by one or two stitches. This tube in most cases can be dis- pensed with in four or five days; but if there is still much discharge it must be retained for a longer time. If the wound is a very deep one, the tube must be dealt with in the same manner as for a sinus (see p. 16). Glass tubes are not so good as india-rubber, because they do not adapt themselves to the shape of the wound. Occasionally they are employed for draining abscesses in the abdominal cavity; and very small ones are sometimes inserted into FULL SIZE Fig. 13. Glass drainage tube. wounds where a little haemorrhage is expected to occur, such as after an amputation of the breast; for this purpose they answer admirably, as they can be removed in twenty-four hours and leave practically no scar.

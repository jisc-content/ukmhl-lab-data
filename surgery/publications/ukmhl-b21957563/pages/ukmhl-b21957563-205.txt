189 THE RECTAL REGION abscess should be opened with a pair of artery forceps, by Hiltonâ€™s method. While doing this a finger should be placed in the rectum to protect the mucous membrane, which is very apt to be perforated. When the pus has escaped a finger is introduced into the abscess cavity and any fibrous bands broken down. The cavity should be lightly packed with gauze, to stop all haemorrhage, and the wound dressed with a hot boracic acid fomentation, secured by a T-bandage. On the following morning, the patient should sit in a warm bath, for a quarter of an hour or longer, when the plug is removed and the wound redressed without a plug. These baths should be repeated twice daily and the hot dressings discontinued as the inflammation subsides. As the discharge lessens, the dressings will require changing less frequently. The bowels should be opened on the third day by means of an aperient, and a daily evacuation secured afterwards; injections of olive oil(i ounce) are useful, as they soften the motions and so lessen the pain. The abscess should heal from the bottom by contraction and granulation, care being taken to prevent the surface edges uniting before the deeper parts have healed. The more slowly the external wound heals, the more surely will it remain healed. As it is practically impossible to keep a plug in the- cavity, the whole success of the operation depends on the adequacy of the external incisions. ANAL ABSCESS Small localized collections of pus are found occasionally round the margin of the anus, being situated just beneath the mucous membrane; if they are not opened, the pus will, in all probability, escape both into the bowel and through the skin, forming a superficial fistula (Figs. 94, 98). Gas is usually quite a satisfactory anaesthetic for these cases. The skin should be shaved, cleansed, and the abscess opened by means of an incision over the most prominent part. If possible the cavity is lightly packed with gauze or a pellet of wool

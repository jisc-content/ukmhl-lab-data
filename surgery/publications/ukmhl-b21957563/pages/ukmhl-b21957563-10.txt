VI PREFACE of surgical cleanliness and lias some opportunity of practising the art. In describing these humble opera- tions we have attempted to make clear the principles of the science of surgery which underlie the perform- ance of its art. Thus, we hope that its perusal will assist those who have not had the opportunity of holding adequate house appointments, to make good the unavoidable deficiency in their education. To attain this end we have prepared a large number of illustrations of the various steps of the operations which have been taken for granted or overlooked amongst the greater details of textbooks and hospital life. To keep the work within moderate bounds any discussion of alternative methods has been avoided, which must give a somewhat dictatorial character to the book. EDRED M. CORNER, H. IRVING PINCHES.

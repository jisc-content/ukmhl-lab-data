THE NECK 83 sides are retracted to an equal extent. Retractors must be used gently or dispensed with altogether, as unfortunately they pull tight the undivided tissues at the bottom of the wound, rendering it difficult or impossible to feel the trachea. The isthmus of the thyroid gland can be pulled up or down, or it can be divided, in which case, however, there will be a little additional haemorrhage, giving more trouble m an adult than in a child. All vessels are clamped, and then divided and ligatured: in some cases where great rapidity is essential this may not be possible, they must then be dealt with at the earliest opportunity. The haemorrhage is mainly venous and is most troublesome when there is much cyanosis, the bleeding ceases to a large extent when the blood has been well aerated. The rings of the trachea can be felt easily and, when the fascia over them is divided, their white colour can be seen. It should always be both definitely seen and felt when doing the operation without hurry. It is opened by stabbing it with the point of the guarded knife, when two or three of the rings are divided in an upward direction. The knife should be guarded with the finger held about a quarter of an inch from the point, this is done in order to avoid wounding the posterior wall of the trachea, an accident which may easily happen in the case of children. The dilators are then inserted and the incision opened. Care should be taken to stop all haemorrhage before the trachea is opened, as it is much more difficult to do afterwards. At first there is much coughing, but when the operation has been done for urgent dyspnoea, the patient soon passes into the opposite physiological condition of apnoca,

63 THE HEAD should be anaesthetized with cocaine, and then seized at the tip with a pair of long artery forceps, the redundant tissue being cut off obliquely with blunt-pointed scissors. If the haemorrhage is at all troublesome a stitch will stop it. UVULOTOMY In sore throats, the uvula may become swollen and cause the sensation of a foreign body in the pharynx. Under such circumstances the uvula should be incised. The part is painted with a five per cent, cocaine solution, and as soon as it is insen- sitive it is seized with forceps, and one or two longitudinal incisions are made with a sharp tenotome; or several ‘ snips ’ may be made with scissors. The oedema soon goes down; and if the incisions are not deep, there need be no fear of haemorrhage. NECROSIS OF THE JAW Necrosis of the jaw commonly occurs in connection with septic teeth, and an abscess usually forms; this may point externally on the cheek or inside the mouth. If possible the abscess should be incised inside the mouth, and the opening well dilated. Should dead bone be present, a sinus will per- sist, which should be treated with antiseptic mouth washes. From time to time the sinus should be probed in order to discover if the sequestrum is loose. When free, an incision should be made (if possible within the mouth). It is better not to cut across the sinus. The incision should be made down to the periosteum, which is stripped up with an elevator. If necessary the opening in the bone is enlarged, and the sequestrum removed, but if the sequestrum is very large, it

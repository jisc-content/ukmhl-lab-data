THE NECK 89 stitches, and a tracheotomy or laryngotomy tube used ioi a few days. The skin is sewn up in a similar manner to that used for a tracheotomy wound. RETROPHARYNGEAL ABSCESS A retropharyngeal abscess occurs usually in children. It forms a swelling on the posterior pharyngeal wall, and should be treated by an early operation: for if the pus is not evacuated it will either escape into the throat or find exit in the neck in front of or behind the steiâ€™nomastoid. The abscess can be opened from the neck or from the mouth; in Fig. 44. Diagram, of cross-section of pharynx, showing position of median retropharyngeal abscess (a) pushing forwards posterior pharyngeal wall, and partly obliterating the cavity of the pharynx. the latter method the pus is apt to escape down the throat. When operating on the neck the patient is anaesthetized, the skin cleansed, and an incision about 2 inches in length made parallel to and along the posterior border of the sternomastoid, commencing above and behind the tip of the mastoid process. The edge of the muscle is defined and pulled forwards with a retractor. Having carefully noted the position of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, a director is passed between the anterior surfaces of these processes and the sheath enclosing the great vessels of the neck, until it enters the abscess cavity. This manoeuvre is much simplified by placing a finger against the abscess wall in the mouth, N c.

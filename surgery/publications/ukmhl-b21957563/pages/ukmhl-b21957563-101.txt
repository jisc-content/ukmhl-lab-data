THE NECK 85 wound, and a layer of boracic lint inserted under tlic shield of the tube ; the lint being changed as often as necessary. A thin layer of gauze may be tied over the mouth of the tube and round the neck; if this is done care must be taken that the patient does not cough up anything, for instance a clot, which would, unless removed, block the tube and cause suffocation. It is better to use this gauze only for the first few days. The room should be warm and airy; sometimes it is desirable to place a vessel of water in it to moisten the air: a steam kettle and tent bed are not often required. The patient has to learn to swallow with the tube in, and this at first may cause some trouble. At the commencement the patient is fed on liquids, with a feeder and tube if necessary ; the diet is steadily increased, as the wound and power of swallowing allow. If the operation has been done for permanent purposes the silver tube can be exchanged for a rubber one on the third or fourth day. If done as a temporary measure, the silver tube should be removed as soon as possible, usually at the end of forty-eight hours. This should always be done in the morning, as at night the patient, especially if a child, is apt to be frightened and the tube will have to be replaced. LARYNGOTOMY This operation consists of opening the larynx in front, through the space between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. It can be done only in adults, as in children the larynx has not developed sufficiently. Its great advantage is that it can be performed more quickly and more easily than tracheotomy, but, owing to the proximity of the VOCal cords, it is not Suitable for cases Fig. 42. Laryngotomy tube, in which it is necessary to wear a tube for any length of time. I he position of the patient is the same as for tracheotomy.

269 THE LEG wound is kept clean, but very dangerous if it is made septic; fingers, therefore, should never be put into the incisions. CHRONIC INFLAMED GLANDS Chronic inflamed glands which have resisted all medical treatment are found as a rule in the groin, as the result of some old venereal infection. They are very painful, and show a tendency to enlarge rather than to subside. They are hard to the touch, and show no areas of softening. After the usual prepara- tions, a free oblique incision is made through the skin over the glands. It is inadvisable to attempt excision: one of the authors has known of a case in which the peritoneal cavity was opened and infected by an unwise attempt being made. Each gland should be incised, and the contents shelled out with a spoon in the same manner as the inside of an onion can be enucleated when the outer layers are incised. No attempt should be made to excise all the capsule, as it is usually adherent to structures by chronic inflammatory tissue; veins may be torn, &c., giving much trouble and offering the chance of dangerous infection. All small and recently infected glands at the periphery of the area should be removed. Having treated all the glands in the same manner, the wound is packed with gauze; it must not be stitched up. Within twenty-four hours the patient is placed in a boracic batli and the gauze plug allowed to soak out; a fresh one is inserted, and the wound redressed in this manner until it heals from the bottom by granulation. However thoroughly and carefully this operation is done, two disappointing results Fig. 169. Groin â– with triradiate incision for the operation of the removal of chronically inflamed elands.

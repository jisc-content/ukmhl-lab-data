224 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE TUBERCULOUS DACTYLITIS Tuberculous dactylitis is frequently met with in children, especially in a hospital out-patient department. It is much more common than syphilitic dactylitis, for which it is occasionally mistaken. It commences in the diploe of the metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges. At first, the bone is merely slightly expanded and enlarged; the disease may be arrested at this point or it may go on to caseation. In the latter case, the caseating material within the diploe first hardens and then softens, forming a cold abscess in connection with the bone; sometimes this abscess becomes infected and sup- purates. There are four stages of the disease which may be pre- sented for treatment; the first is that of the incidence or onset of the disease, when the treatment is for the most part general, though the local application of mercurial ointment seems effica- cious at times. The second is the stage of cold abscess; when the part should be incised under asejitic precautions, all granula- tions and exposed bone thoroughly curetted, and the skin sewn up in order to obtain primary union. Should the abscess re-form, the process must be repeated. In' the third stage a sinus is present; this must be opened up in order to allow of the thorough removal of the dead bone, &c., the presence of which has prevented the healing of the sinus; all diseased structures are curetted and the wound left open. Some surgeons, in these cases, use a powder or an emulsion containing a preparation of iodoform; but it is extremely doubtful if this does any good. In the fourth stage, when the part has become infected, it must be culous dactylitis of first and ring finger.

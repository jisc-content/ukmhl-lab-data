FEMALE GENITOURINAllY 155 urinarius painted with a solution of five per cent, cocaine and ten per cent, adrenalin. INTRODUCTION OP A SPF.CULtM The introduction of a speculum is called for as an aid to diagnosis, or for the application of medicaments to the cervix, the two forms most commonly employed being Fergusson’s and Sim’s. Fergusson’s speculum is a hollow cylinder, one end being bevelled, the other trumpet-shaped. It is made in three different sizes, of metal or of silvered glass. The patient should be in the left lateral or dorsal position. The speculum is sterilized, warmed, and lubricated outside with vaseline. The labia are separated with the left finger and thumb, and the bevelled end of the speculum, with its longest side directed towards the perineum, is slipped between the labia. The perineum is hooked down with the finger and the speculum pushed into the vagina. When introduced for its full length, the cervix should lie in the lumen at the end ; but if not, the speculum should be partially withdrawn and again passed upwards in a slightly different direction. The interior of the speculum can be cleaned with wool on the end of a long pair of forceps. Sim’s speculum consists of two different-sized concave blades placed at right angles at either end of a rigid handle. The instrument is usually made of metal. The patient should be in the left lateral position; and the speculum warmed and oiled on the convex surface only. Either blade can be inserted, but unless the vagina is very patulous the smaller one should be used. The index fin e'er of the right hand is laid, flexor surface downwards, in the concavity of the smaller blade, the other blade being held in the left hand. The right index finger, with the blade, is then passed into the vagina in an exactly similar manner to that employed in making a vaginal examination. The linger is withdrawn and the blade pushed into the posterior fornix; on pulling

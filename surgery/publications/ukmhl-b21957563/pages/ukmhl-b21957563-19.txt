GENERAL 3 make certain of the technique required by the third postulate, he can undertake many operations; for example, an ordinary appendicoctomy requires this technique with a little special knowledge and skill in addition. In fact, if one ventures to predict, it is in the direction of clean operations such as those of appendicectomy, ovariotomy, radical cure of a hernia, &c., in which the work of the general practitioner will extend, because he can for all practical purposes guarantee a good result. But in all probability he will abstain from operating on cases of malignant disease because successful results are so few and far between.

Personal experience alone can tell a man what to touch and what to leave, and this experience can be gained only after leaving a hospital. This book has been written to assist him to undertake with success many of the smaller operations which he will elect to perform; and possibly, at the same time, it may pave the way for him to undertake some of the procedures described in the works on operative surgery.

MINOR AND MAJOR SURGERY In the eighties there was a fairly well-defined line drawn between what were called major and minor operations; and at that time the practical work of surgery was done

230 OPERATIONS OE GENERAL PRACTICE second time the knife traverses the incision, it cuts through all structures clown to bone, the tendons should be put upon the stretch by twisting the finger against the knife. The flap is dissected ofi' the bone, the ligaments round the joint are divided, the metacarpo-phalangeal joint opened from the palmar surface, and the finger removed. The digital arteries will require ligature. The flaps should be united, the wound dressed, and the wrist fixed by means of an anterior splint. The stitches are removed and the splint discarded at the end of a week (Fig. 131, 3.) When it is necessary to remove the head of the metacarpal bone, as in a lady’s hand, the incision should be begun higher up on the dorsum, the flaps dissected up a little further, the neck of the metacarpal bone divided obliquely with bone forceps and the head Fig. 132.

By this method the scar will be less prominent and less liable to injuij. AMPUTATION WITH A FORTION OP A METACARPAL BONE Sometimes it is necessary to remove a portion of a meta- carpal bone as well as the finger. The future utility of the hand will depend to a large extent on the amount of bone removed; the greater the portion removed, the less strong and serviceable will be the hand. If possible the base of the

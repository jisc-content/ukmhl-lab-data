238 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE FOREIGN BODIES UNDER THE NAILS Foreign bodies, such as splinters of wood, occasionally get driven under the nails. They are very likely to set up serious septic trouble owing to the difficulty presented to the escape of any discharge. Generally when first seen ineffectual attempts have already been made to remove the splinter, which in consequence has been driven further in and often the end outside broken off. The nail should be softened by laying on it for a short time a small piece of wool soaked in liquor potassae, and then should be carefully scraped through with a sharp knife over the splinter. When the body has been exposed it should be grasped with a fine- pointed pair of forceps and extracted; dissecting forceps or sinus forceps are not as a rule strong enough. After the removal of the body, the finger should be soaked for at least ten minutes in a solu- tion of perchloride of mercury (1 in 1,000), and a hot boracic dressing applied for twenty-four hours. At- tempts at extraction can be made in the above manner without any anaes- thetic ; but if they fail, gas should be given and the manoeuvre repeated; or it is sometimes possible, by cutting a Y-shaped piece out of the free edge of the nail, to grasp the end of the body with forceps and withdraw it. As a last resort, the nail can be split down with scissors and the body removed. VENESECTION In the past, venesection was resorted to on every possible occasion; later, a reaction set in; and in the present day it is very seldom performed. It can, however, be employed foreign body (splinter) under nail. V-shaped cut in edge of nail for its re- moval.

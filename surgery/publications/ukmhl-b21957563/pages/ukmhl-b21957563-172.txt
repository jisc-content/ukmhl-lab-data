15fi OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE the lower blade directly backwards the cervix and anterior vaginal wall will come into view. It is often helpful if a broadish retractor is used to keep the anterior vaginal wall from obscuring the field of vision. THE PASSAGE OF THE UTERINE SOUND The uterine sound is usually employed as an aid to diagnosis, but before using it the practitioner should make certain that the patient is not pregnant, for the introduction of the sound during pregnancy will cause abortion. The sound should always be boiled before use. The patient is placed in the left lateral position, and, when a vaginal douche has been given, the anterior lip of the cervix is gripped with a volsel- lum, the left index finger held against the external os, and the tip of the sound with its concavity looking forwards is gently introduced between the lips of the cervix. The end is usually arrested at the internal os, but by slowly depressing the handle towards the perineum at the same time that the sound is pressed onwards, the tip will slip through the internal os and enter the uterus. If marked retroversion is present, the sound is introduced with its concavity directed backwards: when the handle is moved forwards towards the pubes the tip enters the uterus. Once the sound is in the cervical canal it must hever be rotated on its long axis, but should be with- drawn and again introduced. Before removing it, the finger is placed -against the cervix, touching the sound, then the instrument and the finger are withdrawn together; the position of the finger on the sound will indicate the length of the uterus and cervical canal. The essential points in passing the sound are, never to use force and never to jerk the instrument suddenly. REPOSITION OF THE UTERUS WITH A SOUND AND THE INTRODUCTION OF HODGE'S PESSARY These pessaries are usually inserted for cases of retroversion and retroflexion ; they are made of various materials, vul-

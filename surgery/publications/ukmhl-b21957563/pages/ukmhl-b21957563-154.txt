138 OPERATIONS OE GENERAL PRACTICE down, one will penetrate the stricture and enter the bladder, in which case it is retained in position and the others with- drawn. Then the metal catheter with the terminal eye is passed over the bougie, which guides it into the bladder, and the urine escapes. In passing the bougies the essential point is never to use force; in introducing the catheter along the bougie more force can be used, because one is sure that, so long as it follows the bougie it will be in the urethra, and therefore there is little fear of making a false passage. This method should always be tried before resorting to a supra- pubic or perineal operation. Retention of urine is relieved frequently by this procedure when all attempts with ordinary catheters and sounds have failed. The method succeeds Fig. 76. Gouleyâ€™s catheter and guide. because the difficulty in passing a stricture is due to the fact that the urethra is not only narrow but tortuous; the different bougies fill up the channel until one of them is pushed by the others over the opening, and passes through the stricture., TYING-IN A CATHETER It is occasionally necessary to retain a catheter for some considerable time, and this can be done either by means of a special winged catheter or by tying-in an ordinary catheter. The first method is not satisfactory, particularly in males, and cannot be relied on, the catheter frequently coming out. The second is the better plan, and there are numerous ways of carrying it out, one of the best being to pass a loop of tape round each thigh, fastening both securely to an abdominal belt or bandage. Pieces of narrow tape are tied round the

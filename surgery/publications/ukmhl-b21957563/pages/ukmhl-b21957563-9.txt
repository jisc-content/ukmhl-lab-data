a 3 PREFACE In this work we have attempted to meet a de- ficiency in professional education. It is a great misfortune that only a very small number of students have the opportunity of holding a postgraduate appointment in a hospital of the first rank; and even if they obtain such an appointment, it only covers a small part of the ground which is the routine of general practice. In consequence, the education of the vast majority of medical men is very deficient in the practice and performance of the many small operations which lie so largely on the borderland between Medicine and Surgery, and which are done by the house officers in an Institution. These very procedures all practitioners are called upon to perform frequently. The larger books omit to describe the steps of such humble operations. Therefore, we have endeavoured to supply the want in this work ; which doubtless contains matter which might have been omitted and may not contain all which it should. The ground covered by these elementary operations is a very important one; because the man who obtains a capable grasp of their technique will have laid a sure foundation for larger and more extended surgical work in the future. Most operative surgery is easy when the operator has mastered the technique C.

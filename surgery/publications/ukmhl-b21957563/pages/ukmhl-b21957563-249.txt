233 THE ARM of the case. The practitioner must not forget that when operating on the hand, it must happen that a joint or some tendon sheaths are opened; therefore special caie must be taken to avoid the introduction of sepsis, all instruments being boiled, and the hands of both the patient and the surgeon made surgically clean. METHOD OP DIVIDING THE METACARPAL BONES IN AMPUTATIONS The metacarpal bones of the little finger, index finger, and thumb are divided in a different manner to those of the second and third fingers. Little Finger. Fig. 133. The bone is divided obliquely so that the longest part is next to the third finger. Second and Third Fingers. Fig. 134. The bones are divided obliquely so that the longest part is to the palmar aspect. Index Finger. Fig. 133. The bone is divided obliquely so that the longest side is to the second finger. The Thumb. Fig. 133. The metacarpal bone is divided so that the longest part is on the dorsum; that is to say, in the oppo- site direction to the second and third fingers. By these devices, it is thought that any obtrusive deformity and inability to bear pressure are avoided. METHOD OP DIVIDING THE METATARSAL BONES IN AMPUTATIONS The method of dividing the metatarsal bones is much simpler than that for the metacarpals, as all are divided in a similar way. The obliquity is from above downwards and behind forwards, so that the longest side of the metatarsal is toward the sole. (See page 266, Fig. 167.) Pig. 134.

THE ARM 231 metacarpal bone should always be retained. The operation is similar to an amputation at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, except that the vertical incision on the dorsum is begun as far up as is necessary to clear and divide the bone. The bone is freed from the surrounding tissues, cut through with forceps at the point desired, the flaps united and the wound dressed as in other amputations. AMPUTATIONS OP THE THUMB In the case of the thumb, it is especially important to retain as much of the bone as is practicable ; and even if it is possible to keep but a very small portion, this should always be done, as its presence makes the hand very much more useful. A formal operation should seldom be performed on the phalanges of the thumb, but one devised which will retain as much of the bone as possible. The amputation of the terminal phalanx, and that at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, can be done in a similar manner to these amputations on the fingers. REMOVAL OF THE THUMB WITH METACARPAL BONE A racquet-shaped incision is made commencing in the ana- tomical snuff-box, over, not above, the joint between the trapezium and the first metacarpal bone; thence running along the dorsum to the head of the metacarpal bone, where it diverges, sweeping round the thumb across the web. The knife is made to cut through the tissues down to the bone throughout the whole length of the incision at the second sweep. The tissues are then dissected away from the bone and, in doing this, care must be taken to keep the knife close to the bone, from which the muscles are cut away. With the left hand the thumb is twisted so that the soft parts are made tense and brought against the edge of the knife. The liga- ments joining the trapezium and metacarpal bone are cut through and the thumb and metacarpal bone removed. The ladial artery should not bo injured; a few vessels, however,

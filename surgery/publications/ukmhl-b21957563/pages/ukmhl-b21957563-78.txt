TONSILLAR ABSCESS A tonsillar abscess can be opened under local anaesthesia, the surface of the tonsil being swabbed with a ten per cent, solution of cocaine. A tenotome should be used, or a narrow- bladed knife with only about half an inch of the blade exposed, the rest being guarded by strapping wound round it. The knife is thrust into the abscess at a level with the last molar tooth; a common mistake is to enter the knife too high up and miss the abscess. The incision can be made by cutting vertically or inwards, never outwards; and enlarged by a pair of long artery or sinus forceps. In some cases of suppurative tonsillitis, the abscess is situated above the tonsil, in the soft palate; if this is so, the mucous mem- brane over the most prominent part of the swelling should be incised carefully with a guarded knife and the incision deepened with artery forceps. Even if pus is not found the haemorrhage will be beneficial, and a track will be left for the pus, when formed, to find its way to the surface. An antiseptic spray or gargle should be used for a few days after the abscess has been opened. right peritonsillarabscess.

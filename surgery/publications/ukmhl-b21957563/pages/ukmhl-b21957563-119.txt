ABSCESSES AND CELLULITIS OF THE BBEAST There are three main varieties of abscesses which may occur in connection with the breast: supramammary, intramammary, and submammary; it is important to distinguish between these three as the treatment varies in each case. A supramammary abscess is situated in the subcutaneous tissue on the superficial aspect of the breast substance; it may be totally unconnected with the breast tissue, or may arise from one of the superficial lobules. An incision, radiating from the nipple, should be made at the point where the abscess is nearest to the surface. As the pus is quite superficial the wound heals rapidly. Intramammary abscess. This is the true breast abscess, the pus being situated within and about the lobules of the gland, and is by far the most common of the three varieties. It should be opened under gas, unless it is at all large, when it will be advisable to give ether or chloroform. The skin having been cleansed, a free incision should be made in a line radiating from the nipple; this incision should be sufficiently large to open up the abscess thoroughly. A finger should then be introduced in order to break down any fibrous bands which may be found crossing the abscess cavity. If the incision is situated above the nipple, or if the abscess is large, it may be advisable to make a counter opening for drainage in the lower and outer portion of the breast, the upper incision being closed. An india-rubber tube should be inserted and the breast dressed with hot fomentations. This tube should be cleaned, boiled, and reintroduced daily; it can be shortened from time to time, and then left out altogether. In some instances, it will be found that the breast is riddled with pus, the abscesses being numerous and widely distributed through- out the substance of the gland. When this is so, many large

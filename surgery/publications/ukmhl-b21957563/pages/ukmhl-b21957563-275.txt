THE LEG 259 incnt. It is then loosened with an elevator, not with gouge and mallet, seized with necrosis forceps and withdrawn. The cavity is then examined with the finger to ascertain if other sequestra are present. If so, they are removed; if not, the granulations are curetted and the cavity syringed out with warm water or saline at a temperature of 110° to 115° Fahrenheit. A gauze drain should be inserted, not a plug; and the wound partially closed or even left open. It is syringed out and the drain changed daily. Too long a period must not be allowed to elapse between the incision of the abscess and the removal of the sequestrum, otherwise the latter becomes enclosed in a cavity whose walls become more tough, fibrous, and unyielding, as time passes. So that, after its removal, the walls of the cavity are too stiff to yield and fall in; the sinus remaining open for months or longer. Indeed, it may be necessary to excise or divide the stiff walls in order to allow the cavity to close and heal. The hammer and gouge should not be used to loosen the sequestrum. The need of their use is a sign that the opera- tion has been done too early, before the dead bone has been separated from the living. These bone sinuses are always septic, so that if a chisel or gouge is used, freshly cut cancellous bone is opened up; which will in all probability become infected and undergo some degree of necrosis. This necrosis is usually superficial, but will be sufficient to delay healing and may be followed by the discharge of small sequestra. Massage and movements must be employed during convalescence to restore the muscles and render the move- ments of the neighbouring joints free. TENOTOMY OF THE TENDO ACIIILLIS It is better to do this operation by the subcutaneous rather than by the open method, as if a scar is left it may become adherent to the cut ends of the tendon. When the anaes- thetic has been given, the parts are cleansed and the foot

To those unfamiliar with the appear- ance, it may seem that the treatment is doing harm. The pain should cease in about twenty minutes if the proper tightness of the bandage has been obtained. The temperature and pulse-rate fall, the patient feels better, the disinclination for food disappears, and nourishment may be taken. Often the patient will fall into a natural sleep after having spent Fig. 128. Chart of a case treated by passive congestion. many nights sleepless from pain. Thus, in some cases, we have seen the greatest blessings conferred upon the local and general conditions of the patient. But it is only fair to point out that this congestive method only aids the patient’s tissues to resist the infection: it cannot do more. And if the extent or virulence of the infection is too great for the tissues, as it may be in an old patient or a diabetic, it will certainly not give good results. It should be combined with an incision or incisions. Besides being of great value in acute cases passive congestion assists the healing of chronic ulcers. With its aid, we have healed in three or four weeks a chronic ulcer on a woman’s leg, which had been present for nine years!

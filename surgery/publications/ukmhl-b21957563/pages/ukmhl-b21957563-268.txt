OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE /â€¢ iJ .V OKO TAPPING THE ELBOW JOINT For similar reasons, it may be desirable to tap the elbow joint. When distended with fluid it bulges at the back on either side of the tendon of the triceps. The elbow is cleaned and the syringe sterilized as in the preceding section, after which, the needle is thrust into the joint through a minute incision on the outer side of the triceps tendon. The opera- tion is concluded as above. EXCISION OF THE PKEPATELLAR BURSA The best method of dealing with an enlarged prepatellar bursa, when chronic, is to excise it. An anaesthetic is given removal of an enlarged bursa pa- tellae. bo removed entire. In doing opening the joint, if ordinary < and the skin washed, particular care being taken to ensure that over the patella it is thoroughly cleansed, as this is a situation where dirt accu- mulates and is difficult to re- move. A curved incision, with the concavity directed down- wards, is made round the tumour, so that the two ends of the incision come below the level of the bursa. The skin and subcutaneous tissues are cut through, and the flap marked out by the incision is reflected downwards. The surface of the bursa, which is held down to the bone and ligamentum patellae by fibrous tissue, comes into view; a little dissection will succeed in free- ing; it, when it can occasionally this there need be no fear of :arc is exercised.

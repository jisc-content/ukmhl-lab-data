264 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE SUTURE OP TENDONS The practitioner will most frequently be called upon to suture cut tendons in the forearm. This should never be undertaken if the wound is septic. First of all ascertain what tendons are cut. After which, a few minutesâ€™ study of the pictures in a good anatomy book will refresh the memory and facilitate the operation. If only one or two tendons are cut, the operation is easy and can be done through a straight incision made along the line of the divided muscle. If many or deep tendons are cut, it is better to turn back a flap large enough to expose fully the field of operation. The distal Fig. 165.

It may be necessary to lengthen the tendon as a preliminary measure. Should a tendon be found whose proximal attach- ment cannot be identified, it must be sewn to such neigh- bouring tendon as anatomical knowledge would indicate. Such a proceeding is called tendon grafting. When all the divided tendons have been united and all haemorrhage stopped, the wound is closed with interrupted stitches, dressed, and the limb immobilized on a splint or in thick layers of wood wool bandaged to it. portions of the divided tendons are easy to find; but the proximal ends retract a long way within their sheaths, so that far the greater part of the incision must be on the proximal side of the point of section.

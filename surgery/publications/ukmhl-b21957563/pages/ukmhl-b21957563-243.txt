227 THE ARM AMPUTATION OF THE TERMINAL PHALANX The operator holds the tip of the affected finger, the palm being directed downwards, between his finger and thumb, the assistant holding the other fingers as far away as possible; the finger is flexed to its fullest extent at the distal phalan- geal joint. With a narrow-bladed knife a transverse incision is made down to the bone, across the dorsal aspect, an eighth of an inch from the dorsal aspect of the bent finger, and the interphalangeal joint opened. The lateral ligaments are divided and the joint freed. The terminal phalanx is more fully flexed and the knife carefully passed through the joint, turned on the flat, and then carried close and parallel to the bone towards the tip of the finger. A flap should always be cut a little longer than the breadth of the surface to be covered. When the flap is of sufficient length, the edge of the knife is turned towards the palmar surface and the flap defined by dividing the tissues transversely. By this means a rectangular palmar flap is obtained. Very little haemorrhage occurs; the digital arteries on each side may require ligaturing. The palmar flap is biought over on to the dorsum and accurately joined to the cut dorsal edge by interrupted sutures. The finger is then dressed with gauze and wool, and an anterior splint incorporated with the dressings. The stitches are removed at the end of a week, the splint discarded, and the wound re-dressed with gauze. In septic cases, such as when the amputation has been done for a whitlow, drainage must be provided, and the splint retained until the wound has healed. Fig. 130.

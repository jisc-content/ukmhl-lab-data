67 THE HEAD nose feel clear, the operation can be completed by passing a curette through the nostril. 2. Snaring polypi. The operator should sit in front of the patient, and work with a frontal mirror and a good light; the most essential point is to have strong illumina- tion. The nostrils are plugged with small pieces of wool soaked in cocaine; after a few minutes all the plugs are removed, and a nasal speculum introduced. A polypus is then carefully defined, and the snare introduced and guided over the tumour, on to its pedicle; it is then tightened up, and the pedicle cut through. It is a good plan to make the patient blow strongly down his nostril from time to time, in order to bring more polypi from behind into view. All the polypi that can be seen are treated in the same manner; a lew small ones generally escape observation; and after a little time they grow, when they can be removed. In either operation, if the haemorrhage is severe, it can be stopped by plugging the nostrils with gauze, or with gauze soaked in adrenalin; this plug, however, should never be left in position for more than twenty-four hours, as it gets in- tensely foul, and will lead to septic mischief, perhaps to infection of the ears via the Eustachian tubes. All manipula- tions must be carefully done, meningitis being sometimes set up as a result of injury to the roof of the nose. After either operation, the nose should be washed out frequently with some bland and unirritating solution, such as sterilized water

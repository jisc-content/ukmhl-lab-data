CHAPTER XI THE LIMBS. GENERAL ABSCESSES AND CELLULITIS Many small superficial abscesses can be opened without any anaesthetic, or by freezing the part; but, when clone in this way, there is a tendency to make the incisions too small. By far the most satisfactory plan is to administer gas, for by doing so the abscess can be opened more thoroughly; and at the same time the patient suffers no pain. An abscess should always be opened by a free incision, usually parallel to the long axis of the limb, and at the most dependent point, in order to allow the pus to drain away. If there is any danger of wounding important structures, or if the abscess is deeply situated, it should be opened by Hilton’s method. This consists in merely dividing the skin and superficial structures, and then pushing a director into the abscess; a pair of artery forceps is passed down the director, and opened, to enlai’ge the track sufficiently for drainage. When incising a deep abscess muscle fibres should be separated, not divided, unless they interfere with drainage. If the abscess is at all large a finger should be introduced, and any diverticula opened into the main cavity by breaking down fibrous septa, but the interior of an acute abscess should never be scraped with a sharp spoon, as this would break down the protecting barrier of granulations. An india-rubber tube should be placed in large abscesses, in smaller ones a thin gauze wick, in order to keep the wound open and allow the pus to escape. In a large abscess additional counter openings may be re- quired (see p. 16). An abscess after being opened should be dressed with hot fomentations, which should be changed

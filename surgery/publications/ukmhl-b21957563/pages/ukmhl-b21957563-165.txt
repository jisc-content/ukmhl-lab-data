MALE GENITOURINARY 149 granulations and the organisms associated with the gonococci ; but these they leave practically unharmed, except that, by affecting their surroundings, the injections may have rendered the habitat of the gonococci untenable. Thus all injections accomplish their object in a roundabout and indirect way. All solutions should be used weak; such as, permanganate of potash 2 grains to the ounce, or protargol \ per cent.; and raised to the body temperature by means of hot water. SOUNDS AND URETHRAL DISCHARGE It is well known that by passing full-sized sounds an old gleet can often be cured. But in this section we wish to recommend this procedure for another reason. Even when a gonorrhoeal discharge has ceased, perhaps for a year or more, the passage of large sounds may cause it to reappear. For instance, in one case we have known it reappear from passing sounds, five years after an attack of gonorrhoea.

This cavity is in part

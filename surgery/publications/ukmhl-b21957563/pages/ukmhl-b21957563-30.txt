14 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE THE MATTRESS SUTURE The suture, usually called a mattress suture, is very useful for bringing subcutaneous structures into apposition. The needle, loaded with the suture material, is first passed through one side of the wound, then through the other; and then back again to the original side in the inverse order. The figure illustrates the stitch passed and also when tied. By its means the edges of the wound can be inverted or everted. In consequence of the eversion of the edges, it is not used much for the skin. The stitch is represented in the figure as being passed in a rectangular fashion and consisting of two parts. It can be made with three, four or more limbs to it; in fact, approximating to the method of inserting the subcuticular stitch. In order to obtain a firm scar, wounds united with this stitch must heal by first intention. DRAINAGE Drainage is chiefly required after abscesses have been opened, but it is occasionally necessary after other operations, to allow blood and serous fluid to escape, which would prevent the wound from healing. There are three main methods by which a wound may be drained, viz. by gauze, by india-rubber tubes, and by glass tubes:â€” Gauze is very popular as a drain for wounds, but as a

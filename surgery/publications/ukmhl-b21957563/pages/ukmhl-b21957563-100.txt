OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 84 and ceases to breathe for some seconds. At this time or when the respiration has become normal, the tube is inserted on its pilot and tied with tapes round the neck in a manner which appears to be rather tight. The ‘ inner tube ’ is placed inside the tracheotomy tube, being so arranged that it can be taken out, cleaned, &c., without removing the external tube; this is of more use in diphtheritic than in other cases. The skin is sutured in such a manner as to leave an opening all round the tube, in order to allow any air which gets exit from the trachea, to escape round the tube. Otherwise Fig. 41. Tracheotomy tube and pilot. the air is blown into the tissues of the neck, causing surgical emphysema. The points in the operation to which particular attention should be paid are:— 1. The light must be good. 2. The head must be held straight. 3. The skin incision must be free. 4.

The best dressing is a little boracic acid powder over the

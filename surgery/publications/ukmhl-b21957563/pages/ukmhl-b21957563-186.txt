170 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE IJ inches from tlie end. are 4 and 5 millimetres respectively at the ends of the cones, expanding regularly to diameters of 7 and 8 respectively, This has been done so that the internal os is dilated to the full capacity of the sound, the cavity of the nulliparous uterus being only 1-| inches in length. By passing the first dilator, 4—7, the internal os has been dilated to 7 millimetres diameter. In passing the next dilator, 5-8, the first two diameters of the conical end, 5 and 6 millimetres, easily pass through the os, which is then dilated so as to have a dia- meter of 8 millimetres ; and so on through the scries until the largest, 18-21, is reached. It is possible to omit a sound in the smaller sizes and pass first 4-7 and then 6-9, but the dilatation is then more forcible than if the dila- „ „„ „ ,, , r , ,. tors are passed seriatim, Fig. 8G.

OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 18 some exudation imprisoned within the wound. If one takes the trouble to observe the first dressings removed from wounds which have healed by first intention, they are almost invariably soiled by the absorption of some of this exudation which has escaped. It is rare for the dressings to be un- stained. If the skin wound is sutured with a continuous stitch, this ‘ aseptic ’ exudation is bottled up within the tissues, and certainly can do no good, whilst at times it may do much harm. In consequence, we have advised that the skin wounds be stitched with interrupted, not with continuous, sutures. Wherever interrupted sutures are used for the skin, the wound must be covered with some material to absorb the exudation which will escape between the stitches. In conse- quence, the dressing next the wound must not be saturated with collodion. We would advise that the collodion dressing be put on as follows:— 1. Place one or two layers of gauze, in the form of strips or sections of a plug, over the wound. Wool does as well. Figure 14. 2. Over these strips place a thin piece of gauze, consisting of a single thickness, which is both longer and broader than the strips previously used. 3. Paste down the edges with a brush saturated with col- lodion. The edges must be securely stuck by a film which extends for at least a quarter of an inch on to the surrounding skin. 4. When dry, cover with another piece of gauze, and if necessary a pad of wool, and apply a bandage for the first twenty-four hours. We strongly advise that a large brush be used for putting on the collodion, as it can be done more accurately and expedi- tiously than with a spoon. The brush can be steeped in spirit for some time before use. In fact it can be left in spirit or ether whilst the operation is proceeding. After the first dressing, the collodion and gauze (or wool) can be placed next the wound if it has healed by first intention.

THE ARM 241 An anaesthetic is administered and the hand thoroughly cleansed. The web is then divided in the middle line towards the bottom of the cleft. From the end of this incision, on both palmar and dorsal aspects, two incisions are made, forming a A, the apex of which points towards the free edge of the cleft. Each little triangular flap of skin is then dissected up and the division of any soft parts remaining completed. The edges of the wound along each finger are united until close to the bottom of the cleft. This done, the triangular skin-flaps are sutured across the base of the cleft, side by side (Fig. 141). The wound is then dressed with gauze; there is no need to place a bulky pad between the fingers; it is uncomfortable and gene- rally painful. The dressings should be changed at the end of two or three days if they .

It is as well not to remove the stitches all at once; a few can be removed in a week after the operation; two days later, a few more, and so on. Movements of the fingers are then commenced, the child being taught to move them separately, also to abduct and adduct them. The acquisition of these movements is essential to the success of the operation. If the part heals by first intention, the two flaps, crossing the base of the cleft, prevent the re-growth of the web. It is as well to perform this operation early, but never before the child is at least one year old, as previous to that date the hands are very small and are difficult to dress, the infant is too young to be taught to move them, &c. If more than two adjacent fingers are webbed, at first only one cleft should be operated on; the other being dealt with at a later date, when the first wound has healed soundly. Fig. 141.

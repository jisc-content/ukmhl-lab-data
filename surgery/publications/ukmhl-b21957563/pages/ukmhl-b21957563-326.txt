It will be seen from this enumeration of the subjects of the drawings that the work is remarkably complete and that it fills a gap in ophthalmological literature. The three vol- umes which are promised are to deal with other parts of the eye and its annexes and to discuss the diseases which affect the eye as a whole, such as glaucoma and sympa- thetic ophthalmia, and if they are carried out with the same completeness, Mr. Parsons will have made one of the most important contributions to ophthalmological literature that has hitherto appeared.”—Lancet. “Few can ever be in the position to have such abundance of pathological material of so learned and scientific a book. We heartily congratulate Mr. Parsons on having put be- fore the profession the fruits of his experience in a manner so accessible ; and we look forward with pleasure to seeing the remaining parts of the work, which, if they come up to the high standard of the first, will long be read as the text- book on ocular pathology.”—British Medical Journal. “Mr. Parsons’ work promises to be a great one, a monu- ment to his industry, ability, and critical judgment. . . . In a work so excellent one hardly feels it necessary to make detailed comment on special portions. . . . We con- gratulate Mr. Parsons warmly on his work, and trust that nothing may occur to prevent succeeding volumes from attaining the very high standard which he has set for himself.”—The Ophthalmic Review.

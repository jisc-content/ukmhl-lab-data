278 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE plate is worn it is often better for the patient to retain it; if removed there is a tendency for the lips to fall together, obstructing respiration. The position of the patient will, to a great extent, depend on the wishes of the surgeon. If the nature of the operation does not render it impossible, the patient should lie on his back, the head being turned to one side, preferably the right, and a low pillow or sand bag placed under the other shoulder. In such a position he is comfort- able and can breathe freely; when he is unconscious, the position can be altered if required. Chloroform should never be administered with the patient in the sitting-up position. DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS The two chief dangers in administering an anaesthetic are respiratoiy failure and cardiac failure. Respiratory failure may be due either to some local cause, such as an obstruc- tion to the breathing, or to some general cause which inhibits the action of the respiratory centre. RESPIRATORY FAILURE DUE TO SOME LOCAL CAUSE 1. In old or edentulous patients the lips tend to fall together, preventing the proper entry of air; this can usually be remedied by placing the end of a towel in the corner of the mouth, or by inserting a small dental prop between the jaws. 2. One of the most frequent causes is the tongue falling back into the pharynx and blocking the air-way. This should be treated by turning the head to one side, placing a finger behind the angle of the jaw which is uppermost, and pressing directly towards the mouth. A finger placed be- neath the chin will keep the jaw well forward. If this does not succeed in restoring normal respiration, the mouth must be opened, if necessary by a gag, the tongue seized with tongue forceps and pulled forward. These should never be applied so tightly as to bruise or lacerate the tongue, but just sufficiently to hold it firmly.

If the polypus is of the mucoid variety, the pedicle should always be ligatured before the tumour is removed, as the stump is very apt to bleed. No dressing will be needed, but the vagina should be douched once or twice daily for the next fortnight. DILATATION OP THE CERVIX Dilatation of the cervix may be required for purposes of diagnosis, as a preliminary to curetting, for haemorrhage, spasmodic dysmeuorrhoea, sterility, &c. It can be done either by means of Hegar’s dilators or by tents; the former is the more rapid method, and can be done at one operation; but owing to its rapidity, the cervix is liable to be torn. If there is no necessity to dilate rapidly, the slower method with tents is the better, provided that care is taken to avoid introducing sepsis. Uterine dilators consist of a set of twenty-six solid bougies, the pattern made of steel and having long handles is recom- mended, such as Matthews Duncan’s. They arc slightly

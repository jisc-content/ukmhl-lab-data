276 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE skin if it can be avoided. Use only sterilized instruments and touch only their handles. 3. Always be quick to do anything you are asked, but do not try to anticipate the wishes of the surgeon, unless you know his methods exceedingly well. 4. Care must never be relaxed until the wound is closed and covered with a dressing. The practitioner should wash his hands first; and when they are clean, should thoroughly cleanse the site of operation whilst the surgeon is washing. Then they change places, the prac- titioner washes his hands again whilst the surgeon arranges his sterilized towels, &c. Both are then ready to commence the operation simultaneously, and the anaesthetist has had plenty of time to get the patient under. During the operation the assistant may have long periods with little to do. For instance, in an abdominal operation, after he has finished sponging and retracting the wound, and the peritoneum is opened, he has a period of leisure whilst the surgeon is doing his special work. Times like these afford opportunities for the practitioner in an absent-minded way to commit aseptic solecisms, such as scratching his unsterilized head or nose, feeling the pulse in the patientâ€™s unsterilized wrist, See., which faults are obvious to the surgeon, anaesthetist, and nurse. He must avoid doing anything like this, as such acts must detract, even if done absent-mindedly, from the confidence placed in him by these three people. If he should do any of these things, he must carefully wash again; his temporary absence may be annoying to the surgeon, but this is preferable to the possible introduction of sepsis. Assisting at an operation is a very simple dut}^ to perform, only requiring common sense and a little special knowledge. And these remarks may be closed with one final piece of advice. Assist^quietly, avoid flurry, never be officious.

121 THE ABDOMEN bone, the direction of the needle must be changed, following the hard bone until a soft place is reached, when it is pushed through the spinal theca and is distinctly felt to enter a cavity. In children the needle will travel about 1 inch, in adults from 2 to 2|, before it enters the spinal canal. Some pale yellow cerebrospinal fluid wells up the canal of the needle in normal cases, such as in those where the operation is done for the induction of spinal anaesthesia. A little fluid can be withdrawn into the barrel of the syringe if required for examination, or for the purpose of temporarily relieving pressure, or a reagent can be introduced into the spinal canal with the syringe. On withdrawing the needle, the wound is sealed with gauze and collodion. The puncture is usually made between the third and fourth, but it can be made between any of the lumbar vertebrae. STITCH SINUS Some considerable time after abdominal operations, especially operations on the gall-bladder, kidney, or for strangulated hernia, &c., a sinus forms. In spite of ordinary treatment this sinus does not heal; the reason being that the discharge is maintained by the presence of a septic foreign body at the bottom of the wound. In a large proportion of cases this foreign body is either a silk or a silkworm-gut stitch, which was either not sterilized properly before use or which became contaminated during use. The removal of the cause will usually bring about a rapid cure. It is better to administer a general anaesthetic, but it is sometimes a satis- factory plan to prepare the patient for an anaesthetic, and then to commence the operation without one; if much pain is felt, it can then be given. The best instrument to use is a long, thin probe, the last portion, about one-third of an inch, being turned up at an angle of sixty degrees like a crochet hook. The patientâ€™s skin being cleaned and the instrument boiled, it is inserted into the sinus and attempts made to hook

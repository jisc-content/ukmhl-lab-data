255 THE LEG rounding connective tissue whilst it is tense than after it has been opened. When the cyst is clearly defined it is opened, the sac seized, held up with artery forceps and the connection with the joint, if it exists, identified. The walls are often very thick and the cyst nearly solid. If there is no com- munication, the cyst is removed ; if the communication is small, the cyst can be removed after it has been cut across; if the communication is large, the operation is made much more difficult as it must be closed with two or three interrupted sutures. In closing the wound two or three mattress or rect- angular stitches are used to close the popliteal fascia; the skin edges are united by interrupted sutures and the wound dressed with gauze and collodion. The leg is wrapped in sheets of wood wool fastened by a bandage. This splint is much more comfortable to the patient than any other. The wound is dressed in a week or ten days. If there was no communication with the joint, the patient can get up and commence walking in ten days. But if the bursa was connected with the joint the patient must lie at least a fortnight to three weeks on his back; in fact, the larger the communication the longer the convalescence. Fig. 156.

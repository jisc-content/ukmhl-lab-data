73 THE HEAD covered with a pad and bandage; it adds much to the comfort of the patient if this dressing is changed on the second day. ARTIFICIAL EYE Am artificial eye can, as a rule, be used in about six weeks after operation. The first essential is that it should fit well and comfortably; the next that it should, as nearly as possible, match the other eye in colour and size. It should be removed every night, and replaced in the morning. In time a glass eye becomes rough on the surface, and when this occurs, a new one must be obtained. TO INSERT MEDICAMENTS IN AN EYE The patient is directed to look to the side opposite to that of the eye which is to have the drops put in. Thus, to put drops in the right eye, the patient is directed to look to the left. The lids are held open with the fingers of the left hand, and with the right a drop or two of the fluid or a small particle of the ointment is placed in the upper part of the external canthus so that the upper lid slides over it when freed. The eyelashes must not be soiled. By directing the patient to blink, the medicament is diffused over the surface of the conjunctival sac. FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EYE A foreign body in the eye is a condition with which the practitioner has frequently to deal. The usual case is easily relieved by everting the eyelid, with or without cocaine, and removing the particle with a camel-hair brush. Sometimes, however, sharp fragments become embedded in the cornea, and frequently these can be dug out with a spud or fine needle under cocaine (two per cent, solution). Often foreign bodies in the cornea can be seen more easily by means of a lens and artificial illumination. If Bowmanâ€™s membrane, the connective tissue lamina on which the corneal epithelium lies, is perforated, an opacity will remain, but otherwise there will be no opacity. A perforating wound of the eye is a very grave accident; it often results, should suppuration occur, in L C.

162 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE means oi‘ a blunt dissector; the knife may be required to divide a few fibrous bands with which the cyst is held. All bleeding points are ligatured and the skin edges accurately united with interrupted catgut stitches. If the cyst is large it may be exceedingly difficult to dissect out entire; under these circumstances it is better to incise it, remove the contents and as much of the cyst wall as possible, the wound being made to heal from the bottom by packing the cavity daily with gauze. The vagina should be douched once or twice daily until the wound has closed. ABSCESS OF BARTHOLIN’S GLAND An abscess of Bartholin’s gland should be opened under general anaesthesia, after shaving and cleaning the parts, by an incision on the inner surface of the labium majus. This incision must be free or the condition will recur. There is no need to insert any stitches, but a small gauze plug should be placed in the wound to prevent it closing; this plug should be removed and a fresh one inserted every day, mild anti- septic douches being given twice daily, or if necessary more often. If there is any doubt about its healing, or if the abscess has recurred, it should be opened by a triradite incision such as is employed often for an ischiorectal abscess. This is easier than attempting to excise the inflammatory mass. FOREIGN BODIES IN THE VAGINA The presence of a foreign body in the vagina may be due to a variety of causes; in young children, such objects as stones, hairpins, &c., are introduced from curiosity; in adults, various bodies are inserted with the idea of preventing pregnancy, procuring abortion, or from perverted sexual instincts; in older women, bodies are introduced to relieve a prolapse, or pessai’ies are inserted and forgotten. The last variety is the one with which the practitioner will most frequently have to deal. A pessary is introduced for a prolapse, the patient wearing it for years without ever having

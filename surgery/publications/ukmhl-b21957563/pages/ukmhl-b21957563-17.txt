CHAPTER I GENERAL INTRODUCTION It is not the intention of the authors to attempt in this small work a description of all the operations which the general practitioner may he called upon to perform. Such operations fall into two categories : the one, in which the practitioner elects to operate, such as for tonsils and adenoids; the other, in which circumstances compel him to operate, such as for the strangulation of a hernia. Only the former will be considered in this book; the operations of the latter class being described in works on operative surgery. In these Fig. 1 a. Operation table, open. c. 15

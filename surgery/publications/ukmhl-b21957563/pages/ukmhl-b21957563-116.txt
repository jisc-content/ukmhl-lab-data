100 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE sion of the lung; not by granulation. The stitches holding the drainage tube should be removed on the fourth or fifth day, and a simple rubber tube substituted for the empyema tube: a safety-pin is inserted across the top of the tube to prevent it slipping into the wound. The tube should be removed daily, cleaned, boiled, and reinserted; it should also be shortened from time to time. As soon as the discharge ceases or becomes serous, the tube can be dispensed with altogether. If at the end of a fortnight the temperature is normal, and the general condition has improved, the patient should be allowed to get up and walk. If the empyema has not healed in from four to six weeks, it is due to either one of two causes. Firstly, the drainage may be faulty, in which case it will be necessary to make Fig. 54.

Under these circum- stances, the only prospect of healing is by an extensive removal of the ribs, a thoracoplasty, to allow the chest wall to fall in and close the cavity; and for this it is best to take further advice. Of late the old practice of incising the intercostal space to drain an empyema has been revived. It is certainly successful in children of from ten to fifteen years of age, the ribs soon falling together, and so closing the opening. Instead of an empyema tube it is better, for this operation, to use one of the glass tubes made for the purpose.

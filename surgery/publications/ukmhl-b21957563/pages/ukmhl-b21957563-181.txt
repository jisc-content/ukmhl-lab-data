FEMALE GENITOURINARY 1G5 only declare their trouble when the consequent cystitis has compelled them. VAGINISMUS Vaginismus is a painful condition, found in young and nervous women, frequently having its origin in some local cause. Treatment must be carried out along three lines: mental rest, sexual rest, and the removal of the local cause. The last is often very insignificant, being exaggerated and glorified by the patient’s neurotic condition of mind. She must be separated from her husband, and, after a few days’ rest, anaesthetized, placed in the lithotomy position, the vagina douched, and the vulva shaved, washed, and rubbed with A B C Fig. 84. a. Clitoris. Black lines indicate method of resection without dividing the dorsal nerves, b. Clitoris, with portion resected, with dorsal structures undivided, c. Clitoris sutured after resection spirit. The whole region must then be inspected part by part. It is well to begin in front. 1. The clitoris may be abnormally developed and hyper- sensitive. It should not be removed; but, if desirable, it can be resected in such a way as to reduce its size, whilst the important structures on the dorsum are not divided, both the sensory nerves and the glans being left (Fig. 84). 2. The labia minora and majora are then inspected for such conditions as painful sores, &c.; then the regions of the orifices of Bartholin’s glands, in the groove between the attached border of the hymen and the labia minora. It may be possible to express some pus from the gland if it is inflamed.

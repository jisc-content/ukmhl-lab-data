33 ANAESTHETICS ADMINISTRATION OF NITROUS OXIDE The gas is stored in an iron cylinder which is connected to a large india-rubber bag; this bag is joined to a face piece, and is fitted with a stopcock which can be turned so as to admit either air, or gas, or a mixture of both. The patient can be sitting up, in the recumbent position, or, for practical purposes, in any position in which it is possible to fit the mask over the face. The bag is filled with gas, care being taken not to distend the bag to such an extent that as soon as the stopcock is turned the gas rushes out forcibly, as this tends to choke the patient. The patient having been directed to take deep breaths, the mask is held firmly over the face and the stopcock so turned that the patient takes in gas from the bag and breathes it out into the air. After a few breaths the face becomes a little blue, and in a short time the breathing becomes stertorous; in a few more breaths it will be noticed that the fingers and eyelids twitch, and if the administration is continued this will go on to jactitation of the limbs; the pupil will be dilated and as a rule the con- junctival reflex will be absent. If the operation is on the nose, throat, or mouth, the face piece should be removed as soon as the breathing becomes stertorous, and the operation done; but if not on one of these situations, the operator can begin, and the anaesthetist turns the stopcock so that the patient obtains one breath of pure air, and then it is turned back so that the patient breathes gas again. If long anaes- thesia is required, a better plan is to administer air with the nitrous oxide from the commencement. After about six breaths of gas, one of air is given, then six more of gas, one more of air, and so on; by regulating the amount of air and gas in this way the breathing can be prevented from becoming stertorous and the patient can be kept under for five or six minutes or even longer. If the colour becomes bad or jacti- tation occurs, the administration must be stopped at once. Special attention should be paid to the following points:â€”

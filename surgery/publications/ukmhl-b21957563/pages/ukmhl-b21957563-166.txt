150 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE broken up by the passage of sounds, and the discharge reappears. But though a coverslip preparation of the dis- charge may be identical with that of a fresh infection, yet it is unaccompanied by urethritis. We cannot but think that the cases of pelvic inflammation which are so often found in virtuous women, sometimes have their origin in one of these imperfectly healed cavities being awakened by frequent sexual intercourse. The possible presence of this cavity is unknown to the man, who may not have seen any discharge for months or years. Thus it becomes highly important that men, who have had gonorrhoea, and particularly those who have had a long gleet, and contemplate matrimony, should have large sounds passed, and any subsequent discharge examined by a competent bacteriologist. When gonococci reappear in a discharge after the passage of large sounds, although bacteriologically there may be every appearance of an acute gonorrhoea, yet there are no symptoms of any inflammation accompanying it. Such a fact is suggestive that the organisms have lost much of their virulence and may not be so harmful as their presence would suggest. But such a surmise must be supported by experi- mental work before the practitioner should alter his advice against such a patient marrying. URETHRAL INJECTIONS The practitioner will frequently be called upon either to inject solutions into the male urethra or to instruct patients as to the best method of doing it. Two points must be noted ; firstly, that the solution injected does not reach the bladder and so carry the infection there; secondly, that the solution comes in contact with all the folds of mucous membrane in the urethra. Before injecting, the patient should micturate, by this means removing as much of the discharge as possible. The syringe should be of glass, capable of holding about 2 drachms and having a nozzle that will fit the external meatus. The syringe, which is kept clean, is filled

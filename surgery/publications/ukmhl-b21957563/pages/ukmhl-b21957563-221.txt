THE LIMBS. GENERAL 205 present time: some holding that large quantities such as 5 pints or more should be used, others that 1 pint is sufficient. The plan which is at the present time most generally adopted is to inject 1â€”2 pints, and to repeat it again later if necessary. It is essential that the fluid runs in slowly, 1 pint should take about ten minutes to inject; the rate of injection can be altered by increasing the height at which the funnel is held. Brandy, 1 ounce to the pint, or adrenalin, 10 minims of a 1 in 1,000 solution, can he added il thought desirable. When sufficient has been introduced, the cannula Fig. 111.

The wound is closed with two or three stitches, a subcuticular stitch is excellent in the case of females, dressed with gauze and wool, a bandage being then applied to the flexed arm. In some instances the vein is not exposed, but an exploring needle is stabbed through the skin directly into the vein in the direction of the heart. This requires practice; and in patients who are to be in- fused, the veins are collapsed and empty, rendering the operation most difficult. 3. Continuous subcutaneous injection. By this method saline solution is injected directly into the cellular tissues of

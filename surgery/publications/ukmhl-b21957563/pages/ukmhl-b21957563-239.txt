223 THE LIMBS. GENERAL In cases where it is doubtful where to make an incision, and in those where an incision has failed to give relief, Bier’s method will recommend itself to the practitioner; not the least of all because it will fill up the trying period for the patient and friends when ‘ nothing is done whilst, at the same time, it is doing good. The authors would recommend it as an adjuvant rather than a substitute for incision. To illustrate the benefits of this method of treatment, we have selected the chart of a case which illustrates what we wish, although the treatment was not entirely successful. The patient was an old lady of sixty, who had a septic hand. On the eighth day of her illness, when her temperature was 101-5°, the bandage was applied round her upper arm. The temperature went down to 986°; the patient slept, which she had not done for nights, and took nourishment better. The bandage was then removed for a few hours, with the result that the temperature rose immediately to 101°. Her tem- perature was maintained between 98° and 100°, during which period she improved in her general condition and developed an appetite, asking for special articles of diet! On the eighth day after the application of the bandage it was necessary to make an incision in the palm, and on the seventeenth it was needful to make more. We have reproduced her chart to illustrate how the general condition of a patient can be improved even when the local trouble is too great to react to this form of treatment. The inflammation extended up the lymphatics of the arm as far as the bandage, which had in consequence to be discontinued. Later, it was ascertained that the septic process involved the wrist and carpal joints, the tendon sheaths and the cellular tissue of the palm ! The convalescence was slow, but the patient retained her hand! Multiple tubercular nodules, fibromata, lipomata, naevi, the., are treated in the same way as when in other situations (see pp. 41, 46, 49, 78).

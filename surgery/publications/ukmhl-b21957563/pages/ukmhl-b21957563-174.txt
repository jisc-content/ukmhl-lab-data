158 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 3. The pessary must be changed every two or three months, india-rubber ones every month. When a pessary lias been worn for some time, in many instances it will be found to be too big, a smaller size is then fitted in its place. A ring pessary is inserted in very much the same manner, by depressing the perineum and gently insinuating the pes- sary between the lips of the vulval opening, which is antero- posterior. As soon as the pessary is in the vagina, it is rotated through a right angle and carried up into the fornices, where it lies surrounding the cervix. In introducing these pessaries, steady pressure is far better than a sudden effort. ADHERENT LABIA This condition is sometimes found in the young. In general the amount of adherence is slight, the labia being easily separated with a probe, no anaesthetic being required ; but in more severe cases both an anaesthetic and a knife or scissors are necessary. The region is well washed with soap and water : methylated spirit should not be used when no anaesthetic is given. The probe or director is passed between the labia and cut down on in the middle line with a knife. Only rarely will any stitches be required, when they should be rectangular and of catgut. The region is then douched with sterilized water, dried with wool, and powdered with boracic or other anti- septic. A piece of gauze or lint, smeared on both sides with some bland ointment such as unguentum boracis, is placed between the labia and maintained in position by a pad of wool and a T-bandagc. It is foolish to imagine that this pad remains in position any length of time ; and it is better, after the first twenty-four hours, to apply the ointment direct to the labia. If there is any inflammatory swelling, the child must be placed in a warm hip-bath two or three times daily. In fact, it may be better that it should pass its urine in a hot bath, the region being dried, anointed and powdered after each time.

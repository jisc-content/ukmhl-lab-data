Nihil tctlgit quod non ornavit. Even in dealing with subjects apparently hackneyed, the author contrives to throw new and interesting light upon them ; while the aphorisms embody the result of clinical observation as acute as it is extensive, and the clear and pithy sentences vividly impress upon the reader the conclusions formed by a great Master of Medicine. We cordially recommend this little book io be ‘read, marked, learned, and inwardly digested’ by all practitioners and students. It is small and easily carried, and the money it costs should be many times repaid by the valuable hints which it contains.”—Practitioner.

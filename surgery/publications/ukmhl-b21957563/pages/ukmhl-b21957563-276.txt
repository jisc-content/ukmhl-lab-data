260 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE placed on its outer side and supported by a sand bag, the toes being held down, i.e. plantar flexed, by an assistant. A sharp- pointed tenotomy knife, about a quarter of an inch only of the blade being sharp, is introduced on the deep surface of the tendo Achillis, about I inch from its insertion into the Fig. 160. Sharp and blunt tenotomes. os calcis. The knife, held at right angles to the long axis of the leg, should be slowly and carefully introduced by the side of the tendon until its point can be felt beneath the skin of the opposite side. A blunt-pointed tenotome is introduced alongside the sharp, which is then with- drawn, and the assistant puts the tendon on the stretch by dorsiflexing the foot. The knife is then turned so that its edge presses against the tendon, which is severed by a gentle sawing movement. Towards the end it snaps suddenly, a gap being left between the two ends, and the knife is withdrawn. The foot should be forcibly dorsiflexed several times in order to ensure that all the fibres are divided. There is no haemorrhage and no stitches are required, a small piece of gauze with collodion being placed over the wound. In mild cases of talipes equinus, the Fig. 161.

Directly it is certain that an abscess has formed the pus should be evacuated, in order to prevent the formation of a fistula. The practitioner should not wait for fluctuation. These abscesses, if superficial, can be opened without an Fig. 98.

The most common cause of failure in treating these abscesses is that the opening has been made too small; if merely a single linear incision is used the cut tends to heal on the surface before the abscess cavity below, the result being the formation of a fistula at a later date. If pus is not found near the surface the

90 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE as, in this way, it is possible to guide the director and at the same time protect the anterior wall of the abscess. The opening is enlarged with a pair of artery forceps passed along the director, and a small drainage tube introduced. The ends of the incision are sewn up and the wound dressed. It will be found that the tube can be removed in a few days, and that the wound then heals rapidly. It is an operation that requires considerable care in its performance. The only abscesses to be opened through the mouth are the acute. The child, at the most, needs only partial anaesthesia. It is then placed on its side and a gag inserted in its mouth. The abscess is incised with a guarded knife, the patients head being turned quickly to let the pus run out of its mouth. Antiseptic mouth washes are subsequently used. These abscesses are very often overlooked; a very useful indication is to find multiple small glands in the neck of a child who is ill. It is particularly suggestive if the glands on both sides are affected. The hint should be taken and the Fig. 45. Sagittal section of head and neck showing retropharyngeal abscess.

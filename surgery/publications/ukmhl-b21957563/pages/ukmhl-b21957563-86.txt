70 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE OTORRHOEA Otorrhoea, a chronic discharge from the ear, may be attributed to any one of three main causes: a dirty septic condition of the middle ear, the presence of a foreign body or sequestrum, or bone disease. The first can be relieved by the practitioner, and the second may possibly be relieved by him. If, on examining the ear, a foreign body is detected it should be dealt with (see p. 69). If the discharge is due merely to a septic condition of the middle ear it should be carefully syringed, and then packed, through a speculum, with boracic powder, aristol, or some other similar substance; if necessary, being redressed several times daily. Should there be any polypi in the ear, these must first be removed under an anaesthetic, all granulations present being destroyed by a curette; whilst using the instrument great care must be taken to avoid injuring the facial nerve. This is done in order that the cleansing powder may obtain free access to all parts. There are two points, however, to note in performing this little operation: first, removal of all polypi is apt to promote free haemorrhage which must be restrained by means of a gauze plug, hydroxy], adrenalin, &c.; secondly, the curette must be used gently to prevent injuring the facial nerve, which may be easily done. The ear is then well syringed out and packed. If the discharge is stopped, well and good; but if not, it indicates that a sequestrum is present or that the bone is diseased. No one has any hesitation in recommending an operation to a patient who has a dis- charging sinus over the tibia. In persistent otorrhoea there is similar bone disease but in an infinitely more dangerous situation ; therefore, should the discharge continue after the above treatment, an operation should be strongly recommended.

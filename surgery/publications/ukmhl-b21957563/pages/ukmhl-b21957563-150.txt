134 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE have no prejudice, we would .suggest for smaller sizes Lister's sounds, which have a Llunt end and a long curve; for larger sizes, Cluttonâ€™s, with a shorter, sharper curve. As a rule, it is not necessary for the patient to have a general anaesthetic, but a local injection of cocaine and adrenalin, or cocaine and resorcin, should be made in the manner already described (see p. 133). The sounds should be boiled, and placed in order on a sterilized or clean towel and allowed to cool; the penis must be cleansed, special attention being paid to the folds of the prepuce.

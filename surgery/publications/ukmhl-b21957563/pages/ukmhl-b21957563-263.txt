THE LEG 247 point of the operation is to remove a wedge-shaped portion of tissue which includes the margin of the skin, the outer third of the nail, and the matrix beneath this portion. A general anaesthetic must be given and the foot carefully cleansed, then an incision is made from a point about a quarter of an inch above the root of the nail, near the mid line, to the end of the toe, just to the inner side of the ulcerated area. One blade of a strong pair of sharp-pointed scissors is pushed down between the nail and its matrix, and the former divided just to the outer side of the middle line: it must be divided right down to the root. The portion of nail on the affected side is pulled away with forceps, and the exposed portion of the matrix is completely removed. By means of these two incisions a wedge-shaped piece of tissue is removed, and the two raw edges are united by catgut stitches and dressed with gauze. No nail will grow on the side operated upon as the matrix has been entirely removed, and a recurrence of the condition is impossible. Excision of the head of the first phalanx is the best operative method of dealing with this deformity. The patient having been anaesthetized and the foot thoroughly cleansed, special attention being paid to the intervals between the toes, Fig. 148 a. Incisions of operation for ingrowing toe-nail.

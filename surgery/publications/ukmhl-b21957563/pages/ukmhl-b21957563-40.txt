24 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE no one urges that these are exact copies of rabbits and ducks. But the laity, such as compose a jury, is gravely asked and expected to understand and estimate at a glance the intri- cacies of skiagraphs. Until it is appreciated that skiagraphs aie mere records of the shadows cast by structures to the X-rays, there must be much misconception about them. It is an obvious corollary from this that it is necessary to have an expert to interpret the meanings of the shadows seen. It is a common observation amongst those who see much of X-ray work, that an expert can detect signs in a plate which one Fig. 16 a. Foreign bodies in thenar eminence of palm.

Besides having such an interpreter, at least two or three skiagraphs should be taken in different positions, so that it is possible to localize points. In general practice, skiagraphs will be required most frequently for two classes of case, to indicate fractures and to localize foreign bodies. Always have two skiagraphs taken from different points of view and compare them closely ; the one corrects any false impressions given by the other. In the latter class of case, it is extremely important to do this, because the exact localization of the foreign body will do much to enable the practitioner to

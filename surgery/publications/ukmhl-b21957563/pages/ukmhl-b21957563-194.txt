178 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE all fluid has come away, and to make certain of this a rectal tube should be passed. Much inconvenience during and after the operation can be saved by careful preparation beforehand. The patient, after being anaesthetized, should be placed in the lithotomy position, the legs being held by means of a Cloverâ€™s AV or some other crutch. The perineal and anal regions are shaved, and the sphincters thoroughly stretched and para- lysed. This is done by intro- ducing, per anum, first the forefingers, then the first two fingers of each hand, and pull- ing gently but firmly in oppo- site directions.

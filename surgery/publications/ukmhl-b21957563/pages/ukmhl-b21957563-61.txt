THE HEAD 45 must be enclosed in an oval incision and removed with the cyst from which they spring. MOLLUSCUM CONTAGIOSUM Small glandular tumours usually found on the face, neck, chest, &c. They can be removed easily by cutting across the base with scissors, and touching the scar with caustic; or by transfixing and dividing them, as described under the section on sebaceous cysts, and squeezing out the molluscum bodies. A dry powder soon forms a cake and is the most efficient dressing. Boracic powder is excellent, and can be washed off in two or three days. DERMOID CYSTS are most frequently seen at the outer angles of the eyes, the root of the nose, and on the scalp. Excision is the only proper method of treatment and can be done easily and safely. A straight incision should be made over the tumour, the edges of the skin undercut, and the tumour removed by means of forceps and knife. It is advisable not to open the cyst as its contents might infect the wound. The skin edges are united by a few stitches, and the wound dressed with gauze. If small, these tumours can be removed under local anaesthesia; but, if at. all large or in a child, it is better to give a general anaesthetic Those situated on the scalp frequently lie in depressions in the bone, and if large may reach the interior of the skull, but they never communicate with the dura mater. Special care must be taken with those at the root of the nose, owing to the very great difficulty of distinguishing meningoceles from dermoids, before operation. The only danger in excising a meningocele is that of meningitis arising from suppuration in the wound. RODENT ULCER is an obscure form of malignant disease, the course of which may extend over many years, the patient finally

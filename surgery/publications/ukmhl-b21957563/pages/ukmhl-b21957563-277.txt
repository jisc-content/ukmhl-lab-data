THE LEG 261 foot should be put up, at less than a right angle with the leg, in plaster of Paris or on a right-angled splint. The plaster or splint should be removed in a week, and the deformity ovei- corrected, the foot being again put up at less than a right angle in the plaster or on the splint. At the end of a fortnight the splint should be discarded and massage with passive movements commenced. In a few days the patient should begin to use the foot, walking a little with a stick, and then perform exercises. LENGTHENING THE TENDO ACHILLIS In some cases, particularly those where a contracted or spastic condition of the muscles is present, as in congenital spastic diplegia, the divided ends of the tendon do not unite. To guard against the possibility of this, it is better to lengthen the tendon and not simply divide it. After the usual preparations, an incision is made obli- quely across the tendon, which is ex- posed. The tendon having been defined, is split from its insertion on the os calcis upwards for such a distance as is required by the needs of the case. At either end of this incision a trans- verse cut is made across the tendon on opposite sides from the free surface to the median incision in it, as in Figs. 163 B and c. The ends are sutured as in the last figure, the tendon being length- ened by the length of the median incision in it. Fine silk is used to unite the ends, are united by horsehair stitches, and the wound dressed in the same manner as after simple tenotomy. The stitches are removed in a week or ten days, after which gentle movc- Fig. 162. Back view of heel, showing oblique incision employed for lengthening tendon. The skin edges

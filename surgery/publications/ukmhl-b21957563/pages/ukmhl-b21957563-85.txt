THE HEAD 69 FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EAR Foreign bodies in the ear are sometimes very difficult to remove, a common cause for this being the inflammation and tumefaction of the external auditory meatus, excited by the foreign body; if possible it is better to defer treatment until this swelling has disappeared. An attempt should be made to syringe out the foreign body, the stream of warm water being directed along the roof of the meatus, the ear at the same time being pulled upwards and backwards to straighten the meatus; if this treatment is patiently and skilfully carried out it is successful in almost all cases. If the body is a bean, pea, or any substance belonging to the vegetable kingdom, water will cause it to swell, although not neces- sarily at once, and to become more firmly impacted. Under these circumstances attempts can be made to remove the body with special instruments, such as wires, hooks, &c., aided by judicious syringing. For heavy bodies, such as stones, shot, &c., it is advisable, when syringing, to have the patient lying down with the affected side lowest; thus allowing gravity to aid extraction. In the case of children it is best to give o an anaesthetic before attempts at extraction are made. The greatest care must be employed in using instruments. Should these measures fail to remove the body, it is unwise to proceed further without taking special advice. CERUMEN Cerumen accumulates in the ear, and causes deafness and giddiness. Very hard plugs form, which cannot always be removed by syringing with warm water. A tepid solution of bicarbonate of soda (10 grains or more to the ounce) softens these plugs, but a better method is to insert a few drops of warm hydrogen peroxide in the ear for a few minutes; the peroxide is warmed by placing it in a test-tube standing in hot water (100Â° Fahrenheit). After softening the wax can be easily removed by syringing with warm water.

248 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE a longitudinal incision about 1 inch in length is â€¢made on the dorsum of the first phalanx, the centre of the incision being over the first interphalangeal joint, slightly to one side of the extensor tendon. If a corn is present on the dorsum, two superficial curved incisions enclosing the corn should be made, instead of one straight one. The tissues should be cut down to the bone, the extensor tendon split and retracted, and the soft structures detached from the head of the first phalanx, which is made to project outside the wound. This is done by cutting the dorsal and lateral ligaments joining the first and second phalanx. The head of the first phalanx is then removed by cutting through its neck with bone forceps; sufficient must be cut off to allow the toe to be Fig. 149. Side view of hammer Fig. 150.

Another method often employed is to make a lateral incision, by which means the extensor tendon is not interfered with; to remove the head of the phalanx, the joint is dislocated after the lateral ligament has been divided. This method has the great advantage of avoiding any corns or doubtfully clean skin. As a rule little or no haemorrhage occurs. The skin edges should be united with catgut stitches and covered with gauze, a plaster of Paris or light metal splint being incorporated with the band- ages. The dressings are changed when the stitches will be free, at the end of a week or ten days; but the splint is retained for at least another week: then for three or four weeks a firm bandage must be worn. The patient will not have a perfectly sound foot until about six weeks after the

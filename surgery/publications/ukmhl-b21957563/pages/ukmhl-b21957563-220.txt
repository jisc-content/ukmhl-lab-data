204 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE in length, is made obliquely over the median basilic vein. If the vein cannot be seen, a bandage should have been placed round the upper arm, which will have the effect of making the vein prominent, but must be removed before any attempt is made to inject the fluid. The vein having been exposed and freed from its sheath, a double thread of silk is passed under it by means of an aneurysm needle; the loop is cut and the more distal ligature tied to compress the vein below the point where the incision is to be made. The infusion apparatus is then filled with the normal saline at a temperature of 105Â° Fahrenheit, great care being taken that no air is present in Fig. 110. Method of intravenous saline infusion. Two ligatures have been passed round the vein, the distal one lias been tightened, and the vein has been incised. the tube or cannula. The vein is then picked up with forceps, and an oblique incision made across it. The cannula, from which saline is escaping, is then pushed upwards into this opening, and the proximal ligature tied lightly round the part of the vein containing the cannula, in order to prevent any blood leaking between them. The funnel is raised, and the fluid runs, slowly at first, into the vein. As the funnel empties, more fluid is poured in, but care must be taken that it is refilled before all the solution in it has run out, oi aii will be driven into the vein with a fatal result. The quantity of saline to be introduced into a vein is a moot point at the

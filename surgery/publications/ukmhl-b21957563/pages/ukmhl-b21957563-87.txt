71 THE HEAD when blocked, such as by serous secretion. The apparatus consists of an india-rubber bag holding about 10 ounces of air, connected by tubing to plugs which fit into the nostrils. The patient being seated in a chair, the plugs are held tightly in the nostrils with a finger and thumb; the patient is then directed to swallow, and whilst doing so the bag is compressed, thus driving air into the nasopharynx, which is closed below by the soft palate during deglutition; the air is thus forced through the Eustachian tubes to the middle ear. Instead of O swallowing, it is quite satisfactory if the patient distends his Fig. 32. Rubber bag for inflating the tympanum. cheeks with air. When this method has been demonstrated to a patient, it is quite possible for him to do it himself. The tympanum can be inflated if the mouth is shut, the nostrils closed tightly, and the patient swallows; but this method would overcome only slight obstructions. EXCISION OF THE EYE This operation can be done under local anaesthesia, but a general anaesthetic is preferable. The conjunctival sac having been washed thoroughly with sterilized water, the speculum is inserted to hold the lids well apart. With blunt- pointed scissors the conjunctiva is cut through close to the cornea all the way round. Tenonâ€™s capsule is opened by snip- ping round with the scissors once again. With the strabismus hook, the ocular muscles (four recti and two obliques) are hooked and brought up one by one, when they are divided

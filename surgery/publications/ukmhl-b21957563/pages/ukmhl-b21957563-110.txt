OPERATIONS OP GENERAL PRACTICE 94 tion of the divided muscle complete. It is of very little value, if any, to use force. Any obvious tight bands can be divided. But we would not advise the practitioner to spend much time on these details as â€˜ they come within the errors of the experiment and the tightest structures are often the cords of the brachial plexus which cannot be divided! After all haemorrhage is checked, the wound is closed with interrupted sutures and the head rotated and bandaged in position, with the chin raised and turned to the side of the divided sterno- mastoid. After a week or ten days, massage and passive movements are begun; active movements following as soon as the patient can perform them. We do not think it neces- sary to place the head and neck in plaster of Paris or in a poroplastic carapace or collar. In course of time the patient will get quite well. When too young for operation, by means of massage and movements, perseveringly carried out, it may be rendered unnecessary. The older the patient the less the chance of cure. All that operation does is to put the parts in a position to grow naturally and straight. It is the subsequent growth of the parts, and not the operation, which effects the cure. Hence the older the patient, the less the future growth and the less the chance of cure. This is a very general principle which underlies the treatment of all the deformities of children.1 1 System of Medicine, by Professor Clifford Allbutt and Dr. Rolleston, 1905, pp. 395-7.

192 (OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE water injection to empty the bowel. After the action lias been secured, the rectum must be again examined and any hardened mass, which has been brought down, removed. The operation makes the region so sore that it is often desirable to dress it with some emollient ointment and to defer the further proceedings for a few hours. The very dry faeces lie in the rectum, and if once this hard plug can be broken up and removed the upper bowel can easily be emptied by enemata. The result of the enema should be inspected, and no one’s word accepted. THE ADMINISTKATION OF AN ENEMA On occasions, an enema must be given by the medical man himself. This can be done either with a rubber tube and glass funnel or a Higginson’s syringe, but the former is by far the more satisfactory. It can be administered with the patient in the left lateral posi- tion with the buttocks raised on a pillow. The sheet is arranged to expose the part sufficiently, and a towel placed so as to catch any escape of fluid. The solution for in- jecting, and the funnel and tube or syringe, should have been prepared previously. In introducing the end of the tube or syringe the direction of the anal canal must be remembered. It is directed upwards and forwards. After lubricating the end of the tube, it is introduced with a gentle screwing movement in the proper direction. The rubber tube should be introduced as far as possible, and the part should always be exposed to do this. The fluid is then introduced gently and slowly, pausing if necessary from time to time; the patient’s feelings are the best guide. In cases of Fig. 101.

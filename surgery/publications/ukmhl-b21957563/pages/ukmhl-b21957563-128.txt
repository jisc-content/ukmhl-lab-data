112 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE berecl that the recti have no posterior aponeurotic sheath in their lower parts, so that when the muscular fibres are separated, the fat in the cavum Retzii is exposed, just in front of the bladder. This fat is divided with a blunt- pointed instrument at the place where it is in contact with the symphysis pubis, and is retracted well upwards with the peritoneum to avoid all risk of injury to that part. This manoeuvre should expose the bladder, which presents a wall of a brown colour with large tortuous veins running over it, more or less parallel to the incision. If the operator has any doubt as to the identification of the bladder, a sound can be passed down the penis, and by depressing the handle the point will be pushed against the anterior wall of the bladder. The edges of the wound are held apart by retractors, and a stitch of stout silk is passed through the bladder wall on either side of the middle line, the needle taking a good grip; these guide stitches should penetrate the whole thickness of the bladder wall, and should be left long and each clamped with a pair of artery forceps. They are then held taut, gently pulling the bladder to the surface of the wound, and a puncture made between them with the knife; the opening should be sufficiently large to admit the finger. The fore- finger of the left hand is inserted, and the interior of the oiâ€™gan examined before much urine has escaped, otherwise the walls will be thrown into folds; any calculi, foreign bodies, &c., which are found can be removed with the aid of forceps. If the opening in the bladder is merely to be temporary, the edges of the incision in the wall are united to the rectus muscle on either side by a few silk stitches, the ends of these being left long; the guide stitches which were inserted first of all are then removed. An india-rubber tube, with lateral openings in the lower part, is introduced into the bladder, and a gauze plug is wound round the upper part of the tube making the opening as nearly airtight as possible in order to establish a siphonagc action, when it is connected by a glass junction to a long rubber tube, which is led to a

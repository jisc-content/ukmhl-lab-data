The antrum is opened by removing with a gouge the thin layer of bone which is over it. Then the communication with the nose is dilated by means of artery forceps passed into the nostril from the antrum; when this opening has been enlarged sufficiently, a rubber tube should be drawn through the nostril into the antrum. Special self-retaining rubber tubes can be worn later, as the opening into the mouth tends to close before the antral trouble has healed. A useful plan is to make the patient dilate this with the terminal phalanx of TRANSILLUMINATION OF THE ANTRUM AND FRONTAL SINUS The method of transillumination is very useful in assisting to decide if an antrum or a frontal sinus is healthy. The method of examining the former is as follows:—The room must be capable of being completely darkened. A small guarded electric light fitted to a special handle is placed in the patient’s mouth, and all light is completely shut out from the room. Then the key in the handle is pressed, completing the circuit and lighting the lamp in the patient’s mouth. If both antra are healthy, the cheeks will be illuminated. If one antrum is diseased, that part of the cheek will be darkened, which can be readily detected by comparing the illuminations of the two sides. The lamp should not be kept lighted long, as it becomes hot. The test is of value in deciding between

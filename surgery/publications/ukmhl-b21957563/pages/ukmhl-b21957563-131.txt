THE ABDOMEN ns between the skin and the rubber that if any siphonage action, however slight, should occur, it would suck out the edges of the fistula, and retard healing. To abolish all siphonage, an opening is made in the top of the dressing, as shown in the figure, to admit air. The apparatus consists of a clear glass vessel of special construction: at its base is attached a disc of sheet rubber and to the exit tube at its side is fixed a piece of flexible rubber tubing, both the joints being watertight. The method of applying the dressing is as follows: The various parts of the dressing, having been sterilized and dried, are fitted together; the patient’s skin around the fistula is shaved, and any urine appearing on the surface is removed by placing small swabs in the fistula and changing them frequently.

If this cannot be done owing to the skin being painful, this dressing cannot be applied effectively. The under-surface of the rubber disc is coated in the same way, and it will be found that the solution is more easily applied if put on rapidly: both surfaces so coated are allowed to become nearly dry and quite ‘ tacky ’. The base of the glass is applied over the centre of the fistula, care being taken that the exit tube points either towards the pubes or to the side on which the patient prefers to lie, and the disc is pressed down evenly and gently all round. If the solution on the skin is too thickly spread, the disc curls back and does not

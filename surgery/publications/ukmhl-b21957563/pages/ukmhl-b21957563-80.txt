G4 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE may have to be broken up first. The cavity in the bone should be thoroughly scraped,all granulations being removed; it should then be rinsed with sterilized water, and plugged with gauze, which can be removed within twenty-four hours. It depends on the size and the shape of the cavity whether it should be replugged or not, but syringing should be continued, and antiseptic mouth washes used frequently. ALVEOLAR ABSCESS In nearly all cases an alveolar abscess can be relieved by removing the offending tooth, but in many instances it is not advisable to extract a tooth which can be made perfectly sound by subsequent treatment at the hands of a dentist. By opening the abscess, pus is allowed to escape and relief is obtained. An incision is made in the fluctuating swelling inside the mouth, the edge of the knife being directed towards the alveolus. As a rule no plug is required. The mouth should be washed out frequently with hydrogen peroxide (Liquor Hydrogenii Peroxidi, one part: water, ten parts). These abscesses have a tendency to make their way outwards through the cheek ; if possible, this must be prevented by early incision within the mouth, a common mistake is to apply hot fomentations externally. If the abscess is on the gum or the outer side of the jaw, it is easily seen. But when on the inner side of the jaw, and particularly by the posterior molars, it is apt to be overlooked and may extend into the neck : where it may be necessary to make an incision. TONGUE TIE is a condition which is said to be very common, but the cases requiring treatment arc very few. Cutting the frenum linguae is an operation that has been done far too frequently in the past, and the result in cases where it is not necessary is to cause cicatrization, and consequently an increase in the very condition which the operation was supposed to relieve.

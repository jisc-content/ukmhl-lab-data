265 THE LEG For success, this wound must heal by first intention, or the tendons will part and become adherent to surrounding struc- tures. The stitches are removed at the end of a week and the fingers gently moved. On the tenth day the patient is in- structed and encouraged to move them himself, both actively and passively. The movements must be gentle at first, becoming stronger as time passes. Six weeks is approxi- mately the minimum period before a hand fully recovers. Massage of the bellies of the muscles can be begun at the end of a week from the operation, electrical treatment at the end of a fortnight. AMPUTATION OF THE TOES The toes can be removed in a manner similar to the various operations already described on the fingers p. 227. But in Fig. 166 Togs. 1.

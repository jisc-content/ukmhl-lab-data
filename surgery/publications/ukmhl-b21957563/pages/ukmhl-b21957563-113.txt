THE CHEST or which the air can be exhausted by a pump. If the collection is localized, it is best to tap close to the exploration puncture, otherwise the place of election is either the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line, or immediately below the inferior angle of the scapula. Having sterilized the exploring needle and a small sharp knife, the site of the operation is selected and cleansed. The skin being drawn up in the manner described above, a small incision, a quarter of an inch long, is made at the upper border of the lower rib, the needle being then thrust sharply through this puncture into the pleural cavity. It is connected by the junction with the receiver, which previously has been exhausted, and the fluid runs into the bottle. It should be drawn off slowly, particularly towards the end. Spasmodic coughing indicates that the flow must be stopped for a time; and if the fluid becomes bloodstained it had better be stopped altogether. When sufficient fluid has been extracted, the needle is withdrawn and a finger placed over the opening, which is then sealed with gauze and collodion. It is always desirable to use a knife, particularly when no anaesthetic is given, on account of the toughness of the skin and the difficulty of piercing it with a needle or trocar and cannula. As a rule no anaesthetic is needed, but C. 0

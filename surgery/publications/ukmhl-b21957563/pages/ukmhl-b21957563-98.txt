OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 82 the easier is the operation. The low operation is the more difficult to perform, is fraught with more possible accidents, and opinions are divided as to whether it has compensatory advantages. The patient lies in the dorsal position with his arms placed close to his sides; in the case of a child a towel is wrapped round the body to retain them in that position. The shoulders are raised by a hard pillow or sand bag, so that the neck is stretched, thereby bringing the trachea as near as possible to the surface. After the instruments have been boiled and are ready for immediate use, the anaesthetic is administered. Fig. 39. Neck indicating incision for tracheotomy. Chloroform is the best to employ, and it should be given slowly and with great caution, the patient never being deeply under. After the skin incision, very little more anaesthetic will be required. When the neck has been cleansed, and the patientâ€™s chin held in the middle line, an incision is made from the thyroid, or in adults the cricoid, cartilage, to just above the sternum. It is as well to make the incision as long as this, especially when the practitioner has not fre- quently performed this operation. The incision is then deepened, and the muscles over the trachea separated and held apart by retractors; care should be taken that the two

CHAPTER VI THE CHEST EXPLORATION OR TAPPING THE PLEURAL CAVITY Exploration is undertaken in order to determine whether fluid is present in the pleural cavity or not; and if present, to demonstrate its nature. The instrument required is a strong perforated needle fitting- on to a syringe with a glass barrel. This can be sterilized by boiling, when an extra Fig. 49. Exploring syringe. glass barrel to the syringe should be handy, in case of breakage, or by means of soaking in methylated spirit. A hypodei-mic needle is too fine, being apt to break, and the barrel of the syringe is small. The site for exploration, which should be the place where the physical signs suggest the presence of fluid, is selected, and the surface cleansed. The skin is drawn up and steadied by the forefinger and thumb of the left hand. The exploring needle is thrust in sharply, just above the upper border of the rib, below the point selected. On withdrawing the piston of the syringe, any fluid present in the pleural cavity will flow into the barrel. Care must be taken that the needle is thrust through the struc- tures of the chest wall, and does not push them in front of it.

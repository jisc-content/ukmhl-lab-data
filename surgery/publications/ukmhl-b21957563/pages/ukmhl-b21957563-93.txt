77 THE NECK of a deep abscess or cellulitis, it is best to insert an india- rubber tube into the wound to act as a drain and to ensure its being kept open. Reference must be made here to Ludwigâ€™s angina, a severe and dangerous form of submaxillary cellulitis which may complicate apparently ordinary sore throats, but especially those accompanying the specific fevers. The spread of the infection is very rapid, rendering necessary numerous and free incisions, such as from the tip of the lower jaw, vertically down the middle line of the neck, and from the angles of the lower jaw, forward, parallel to the rami. In dealing with these cases no question of the amount of the subsequent scarring must enter into consideration. The incisions will appear deep, owing to the large amount of swelling present; the skin should not be stripped up, as, if this is done, there is a risk of its sloughing. Too many rather than too few incisions must be made. As a rule little or no pus or blood will escape from the incisions, which should be left open and dressed with hot fomentations. These should be changed every four hours. As the patient improves the wounds will become redder and discharge more. CARBUNCLES Carbuncles are most frequently situated about the back of the neck, at the edge of the hair-covered area, and in nearly all eases require surgical treatment. When operating, the common mistake is to make the incision far too small. The skin must be shaved for some little distance round the car- buncle, which should be freely opened by two incisions crossing each other at right angles, care being taken that all the area of hardness is opened up by the incisions. If the inflammatory condition has shown a tendency to spread, the quadrants of skin marked out by the incisions must be raised, and the septic focus beneath them thoroughly opened up. A blunt curette and forceps can be used to remove the slough, but care should be taken not to destroy the wall of granulation tissue

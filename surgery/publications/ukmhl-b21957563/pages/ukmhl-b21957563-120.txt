104 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE incisions must be made, all the abscesses being thoroughly opened and drainage tubes inserted. The breast has a wonderful recuperative power, and as a rule, in these cases very little permanent deformity results, the contour of the gland being restored. If the abscess has not been satis- factorily opened the patient will develop one or more sinuses and the condition will become chronic. The treatment then consists in opening up and scraping all such sinuses, and introducing drainage tubes in order to prevent the accumula- tion of pus. In severe cases it may be necessary to amputate the breast. A submammary abscess is situated in the cellular tissue beneath the breast; it usually arises from cellulitis or caries of a rib, but may develop from the deeper lobules of the breast. A fluctuating swelling is formed, on which the breast rests as on a water-bed, the pus pointing in the lower and outer quadrant. The treatment consists in making a free incision in the situation where the pus points, which is usually along the axillary margin, exploring the cavity with a finger, making another opening if necessary, and introducing drainage tubes. The after-treatment will be similar to that for an intramammary â€¢ abscess. The practitioner, if possible, should not wait for the forma- tion of the abscess, but should incise the breast beforehand in the cellulitis stage, so that he opens no definite abscess. With this practice his patients will have shorter convalescences and be saved an infinity of pain, extra incisions for drainage, dressings, worry, and expense. SUBPECTOEAL ABSCESS A subpectoral abscess is one situated beneath the pectoral muscles and the ribs. It has no connection with the breast, and is only mentioned in this place because it presents some features like a submammary abscess. It is usually due to caries or necrosis of the subjacent ribs, and presents in the anterior and lower part of the axilla. It is opened by an

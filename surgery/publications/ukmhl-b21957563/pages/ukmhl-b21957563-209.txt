THE RECTAL REGION 193 severe constipation, it is well to introduce some warm olive oil, from a few ounces to a pint, half an hour before adminis- tering a simple enema. To give a copious enema such as may empty the large bowel, the administration must be done slowly. If the amount given is small and the action quick, the enema has probably been badly given. There is skill in this little operation, as is seen in the differences in the results obtained by various nurses. RECTAL IRRIGATION There is much difference of opinion about the value of rectal irrigation for the cure for intussusception, but it is certainly useful in many cases. It is also used for certain ulcerous conditions of the large bowel. (a) In an adult. The patient is placed in the dorsal position with the buttocks raised on one or two pillows. A rubber tube about 3-4 feet long is anointed and passed as far up the rectum as possible. A glass funnel is then joined to it, and the injection, which has been warmed, poured in. It should be done very slowly to avoid stimulating the bowel to action. (b) In children. Rectal injections are mainly used as an aid to the reduction of intussusceptions. The child is anaesthetized and laid on a warm water bag. If possible everything should be ready for operation. The injection usually consists of warm olive oil or saline solution. The buttocks can be slightly raised; it is unnecessary to invert the child. The fluid is injected through a rubber tube and funnel as above. The injection is done gently; it does not return until about 15 ounces have been injected. By abdominal palpation the tumour may be felt to move or disappear. If it does not disappear, there is no doubt that the operation is required: if it does disappear, some advise waiting and watching ; others, that the ileocaecal region be inspected, when it is common to find that the last part of the intussusception lias still to be reduced.

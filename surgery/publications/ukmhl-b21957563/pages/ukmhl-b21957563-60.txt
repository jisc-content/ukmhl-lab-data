44 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE weeks, it is possible to determine if further treatment will be required. If the naevus is at all large, it is usually neces- sary to repeat the operation several times before the tumour is completely destroyed. Special attention should be paid to the growing margin of the naevus. In employing electrolysis, great care must be taken not to do too much at one sitting, or sloughing may occur. It is better to do too little than to risk doing too much. SEBACEOUS CYSTS Sebaceous cysts are situated most commonly on the scalp, then on the cheek and neck. As with dermoid cysts, excision is the piâ€™oper treatment. For practical purposes it should be recognized that a sebaceous cyst cannot be removed without breaking it, but, unless suppurating, little harm is likely to result from the sebaceous material touching the wound during the operation. The hair for some distance round the cyst must be removed and the scalp cleansed; inject eucaine hypodermically round the base of the cyst; when the skin is anaesthetized, transfix the cyst with a thin-bladed knife, then cut upwards, the knife coming out on the surface of the skin; wipe away the sebaceous material and then, with for- ceps, pull away the cyst wall entire. The wound is closed, if necessary, with a few horsehair or catgut stitches, and a firm dressing put on to prevent the accumulation of blood in the wound. If the cyst is on the face, it is sometimes better, instead of one straight incision, to make two curved ones enclosing a portion of skin between them if it is adherent to the tumour, then shell out the cj^st entire. When the c}\st has been subject to inflammatory mischief, the wall is often thickened and adherent, requiring to be dissected out; none must be left behind. When suppuration is present, the cyst wall should if possible be removed, and a gauze drain left in the wound. Sometimes horns develop, due to slow leakage and drying of the sebaceous material; these when present

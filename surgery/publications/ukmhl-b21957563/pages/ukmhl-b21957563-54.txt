OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 38 or by tilting the chin upwards. The tongue l'orceps should be used as seldom as possible, and should bo used lightly; for if employed often or carelessly, the tongue is subsequently very painful. 8. For the successful administration of an anaesthetic it is necessaxy to watch the'patient and not the operation. If the anaesthetist does not give his whole attention to his subject, the first indication that he may have that the patient is in a bad condition may be the cessation of breathing; whereas a careful anaesthetist would have noted a change in the respiratory rhythm and facial aspect and would have warded off the danger by early action. THE ADMINISTRATION OP ETHYL CHLORIDE All that is needed to give ethyl chloride is a well-fitting face piece, a bag to contain the drug, and a stopcock of a similar nature to that used for the administration of nitrous oxide. The recumbent position is preferable, but the anaesthetic can be administered sitting up. The quantity of the drug required varies with the age of the patient, being approximately in children 2-5 cubic centimetres, in women 4, in men 5, which amount should be squirted into the bag and the administra- tion proceeded with as for nitrous oxide without delay. If necessary, during the administration, a second dose of 2 or 3 cubic centimetres may be given. The drug is very much more powerful than nitrous oxide, and a patient tends to p'o under sooner, in some cases three or four breaths being sufficient, and if care is not taken an overdose may be given very easily to these patients. Before commencing the ad- ministration always place a dental prop between the teeth, as frequently a considerable amount of muscular spasm occurs. Ethyl chloiâ€™ide can be used as a preliixiinaiy to ether anaesthe- tization in almost the same way as nitx'ous oxide, oxxly the ether is turned oxx and the ethyl chloride turned of! a little sooner.

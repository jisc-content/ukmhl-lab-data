THE CHEST 101 It is possible, while there is still an opening in the chest, to aid the expansion of the lung on the affected side, by making the patient expire forcibly against resistance. An efficient apparatus consists of two bottles, one containing water, joined together by tubing so arranged that by blowing into one bottle the water is forced into the other (Fig. 55). In children it is necessary to provide amusement with the exercise, and a trumpet or whistle that will not make a noise unless blown hard, answers the purpose.

A FOREIGN BODY IN THE OESOPHAGUS A foreign body in the oesophagus may give rise to little in the way of symptoms, but there are sometimes complaints of Fig. 56.

The situation of the body is ascertained by means of a bougie and, when possible, a skiagraph: the common situation for a body to be impacted is about the level of the sternal notch. Attempts can be made under an anaesthetic to remove the body by the mouth with forceps, probang, coin-catcher, &c. A coin-catcher should never be used without the surrounding: safety tube as, in withdrawing, the ‘ catcher ’ is apt to hook against the cricoid cartilage of the larynx. Such an accident will cause considerable trouble and anxiety, besides frighten- ing the patient; whilst, with the safety tube, the instrument is easily unhooked from the cricoid cartilage by merely passing the tube along the handle of the catcher. Time should not be wasted or too strenuous attempts made before taking further advice with regard to the advisability of

266 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE the case of the toes, it is useless to retain a portion of a phalanx; for if any is left behind, it gradually becomes drawn up, ulceration, &c., being produced by the pressure of the boot. It is important, however, to retain the heads of the metatarsal bones. The great toe differs from the others in supporting part of the weight of the body, so that it is necessary to retain as much of it as possible, always remem- bering to suture the cut tendons to the periosteum or tendon sheath. In operating on the toes special care must be Fig. 167.

The toes and their metatarsal bones can be amputated in a similar way to that used for the fingers and their metacarpals; it is important, however, to retain the metatarsal bones of the great and little toes, as through these a large portion of the bodyweight is trans- mitted. Incisions must not be made on the inner or outer borders of the foot, as the pressure of the boot may cause pain, &c. The breadth of the foot is very important for the steadiness of the possessor. There are two main operative methods of dealing with this condition: (1) Tying and excising part of the internal saphena vein high up in the thigh, Trendelenburgâ€™s operation; (2) removing the veins locally. In most cases it is best to combine the two methods. Undoubtedly, when the varicosity is only slight and is limited to the lower part of the leg, local removal of the dilated veins will give a satisfactory result, at all events temporarily; but the main column of blood is not VARICOSE VEINS

CHAPTER III THE HEAD NAEYI Naevi are tumours of blood-vessels and, for practical pur- poses, can be divided into two classes, cutaneous and sub- cutaneous. These two divisions are not distinct from one another, one tumour often combining characteristics of both. Yet the division is useful in directing attention to those points which indicate special lines of treatment. Wherever it is possible, naevi should be removed by excision ; of all methods of treatment it is the one which leaves the least scar, the least deformity, and is the most certain in its results. When excising naevi, it should be borne in mind that the sub- cutaneous variety is more or less encapsulated, whilst the cutaneous is not; and in consequence the former can be excised easily whilst the latter must be removed together with a margin of healthy tissue. In the cutaneous form, if the cases of recurrence after electrolysis or other non-operative treatment are examined, it will be seen that frequently the failure is due to the fact that the growing margin was not destroyed, and consequently, a new ring of naevoid tissue has appeared round the site of the scar. The zone of apparently healthy skin round the edge of a naevus must always be destroyed. The excision of a cutaneous naevus is limited by its size and situation. After the removal of large tumours, if the skin edges will not meet, the raw surface can be covered by means of skin grafts. A subcutaneous encapsulated naevus can be removed through a straight incision, the wound being opened up by undercutting its edges; the haemorrhage is not severe provided that the surrounding c. u

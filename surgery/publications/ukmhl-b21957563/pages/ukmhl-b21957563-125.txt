CHAPTER VII THE ABDOMEN PARACENTESIS ABDOMINIS It is necessary in certain conditions to tap the abdomen in order to withdraw fluid which has accumulated there, and this is usually done by means of a special trocar and cannula. A small knife, the trocar, cannula, india-rubber tubing, and the patientâ€™s skin are all carefully sterilized. The site for tapping is selected where the percussion note is absolutely dull ; the usual spot being in the middle line, half-way between the umbilicus and pubes. To ensure the bladder being quite safe from injury it should be emptied immediately before the Fig. 59. Trocar for paracentesis abdominis. operation, if necessary a catheter being passed. The patient being in the semirecumbent position, and the skin having been cleansed and rendered insensitive either by freezing or by injecting eucaine, a small puncture about one-third of an inch long is made with the knife at the spot selected.

The fluid is drained into any large, clean vessel; as many pints may be present, plenty of vessels should be at hand.

184 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE clean, and if the dressing is adherent it can be allowed to soak off in the bath. The bowels should be opened on the third day, and after that a daily motion must be secured. The wound heals from the bottom by granulation, and in doing so a considerable amount of contraction occurs, to such an extent that a lai’ge, gaping cavity becomes converted into a small, puckered scar. Blind externcd fistula. A probe is passed down the track, and if the end of the probe projects beneath the mucous mem- brane in the rectum, it is pushed through, converting the blind into a complete fistula, which is then treated as above. If however, the probe enters the ischiorectal fossa, the external opening is enlarged by making a deep triradiate incision, and the wound is allowed to heal from the bottom by granulation. The after-treatment is the same as for the complete fistula. Blind internal fistula. A probe with the end bent is passed into the rectum, and the tip of the probe inserted in the mouth of the fistula, and passed gently down the track. The tip of the probe projects beneath the skin at the anal margin, and is cut down upon, and a triradiate incision made. The incom- plete fistula is thus converted into the complete one, and is treated as such. The old operation of simply ‘ slitting ’ the fistula is not sufficient and should never be done, for the external wound closes before the deeper parts have healed, the condition will therefore recur and the patient be disappointed. It is desir- able to remove the skin edges to prevent this; or to use the triradiate incision. FISSURE IN ANO A fissure in ano can frequently be cured by palliative treat- ment, but if this fails recourse must be had to operation, either stretching the external sphincter or dividing it. The patient is prepared in the same manner as for any other rectal operation, and is placed in the lithotomy position. The anaesthetic having been administered, the sphincter is

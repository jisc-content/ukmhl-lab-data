This takes time, the length of which varies with the situation and the size of the sequestrum. For instance, sequestra separate more quickly in the arm than in the leg. As a general rule, it will take at least eight weeks. It is usually said that with the help of two probes the sequestrum can be tilted and proved to be Fig. 159.

To remove it, the wound is enlarged, cautiously on the inner side of the knee on account of the femoral artery crossing by the upper end of the incision.

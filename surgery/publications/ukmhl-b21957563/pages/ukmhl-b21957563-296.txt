280 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE this fails ancl the symptoms demand urgent treatment, no delay should be allowed, but laryngotomy or tracheotomy done at once (see pp. 81-6). RESPIRATORY FAILURE DUE TO SOME GENERAL CAUSE One of the most common causes of failure of respiration is an overdose of the drug ; but it may also be due to shock caused by the operation. The following signs indicate the fact that an overdose has been given: The breathing gradually be- comes more feeble, the face changes colour taking on an ashy grey tint, the pupils become widely dilated and are insen- sitive to light, no corneal reflex is present, the pulse is affected later, becoming feebler. The anaesthetist should always be on the look-out for these signs of an overdose, so that by removing the anaesthetic, the danger can be averted. If an overdose has been given the anaesthetic should be stopped immediately, the head turned to one side and pressure made with the finger upon one angle of the jaw in the direction of the mouth; this will often restore respiration, but if not the tongue should be drawn forwards with tongue forceps. These various manipulations take very little time; and if the patient does not recover quickly, artificial respiration should be commenced, Sylvesterâ€™s method being the most satisfactory. While this is being done, the chest should be flapped with wet towels, and ether and strychnine given hypoder- mically. An interrupted or continuous current can be given, one pole being placed over the heart, the other on some indifferent part of the body; as a rule, however, the necessary apparatus is not at hand. If the patient does not respond, artificial respiration should be continued for at least half an hour from the time that respiration ceased. CARDIAC FAILURE This is undoubtedly the greatest danger to which a patient taking an anaesthetic is liable; it seldom occurs except v hen

239 THE ARM with benefit much more frequently than it is. For pre- ference, the patient should be sitting up in bed; a pad and bandage should be firmly bound round the arm above the elbow, the hand having been allowed to hang down for a few minutes before it is applied; this is of especial im- portance in stout patients in whom the veins are not prominent. The knife is sterilized and the skin over the front of the elbow thoroughly cleansed, when the patient is made to grasp some object, such as a bandage, in his hand, to make the veins stand out. Usually one of the veins at the bend of the elbow is selected, but the internal saphena in the leg does as well. At the elbow, the choice lies between Fig. 139.

The arm is grasped by the operatorâ€™s left hand, and the thumb compresses the vein just distal to the point where it is to be opened. A small incision is then made obliquely across the vein, care being taken not to cut light through it. A bowl should be in readiness under the elbow to catch the blood, the arm is turned round towards

19 GENERAL This dressing is very convenient to the doctor and will save the patient much expense. It has been urged that the collodion occasionally blisters the skin round the wound. This is certainly true, but we believe it occurs mainly where the wound is septic; and therefore the fault lies leather with the surgeon and his accessories than with the collodion. At any rate, we can state that we have had no trouble from collodion made from the following formula:— Collodion 12 fluid ounces. Canada Balsam ■§ ounce. Castor oil i ounce. (Collodion Flexile. B.P.) In certain situations, as on the leg or inguinal region, the collodion dressing adheres to the growing stumps of the shaved hairs. In consequence its removal may be rather painful to nervous patients. It can, however, be loosened by painting the edges with ether on a brush, liquefying the collodion again. Then the dressing is removed easily. Care must be taken not to use the ether too freely or it may reach the wound and smart severely. There is one other point in removing these dressings: the cut ends of the sutures may have become adherent to it, so that they may be unintention- ally pulled as the dressing is being peeled off. In using collodion on the inguinal region of a conscious patient, care must be taken that no excess of fluid runs down to the genital region or it will cause a very severe smarting or burning pain.

This is simply because there is not, for the purpose, a handy apparatus, which can be carried in the pocket.’ These two sentences are selected from a criticism upon a urine-testing case, invented by Dr. A. E. Russell to meet the demand for a ‘ handy appai’atus which

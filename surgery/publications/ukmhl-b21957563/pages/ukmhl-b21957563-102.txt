86 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE An anaesthetic is administered, for preference chloroform, and a vertical incision made in the middle line about 1-| inches in length, beginning over the thyroid cartilage; the muscles are retracted on either side, and all haemorrhage stopped. The cricothyroid membrane is exposed, and punctured by a stab with the guarded knife, and then divided transversely, a laryngotomy tube being introduced. This tube differs from a tracheotomy tube in being flattened whilst the latter is round. In an emergency this operation can be done in two cuts. As a laryngotomy is only done as a temporary measure, the tube must be discarded in a few days. The dressings, &c., are the same as those recommended for tracheotomy. INTUBATION OF THE LARYNX Intubation of the larynx is done as an alternative in cases of laryngeal obstruction in children. It certainly appears to give better results than tracheotomy, in children under five; it is not so severe an operation, and no anaesthetic is needed, but it requires a considerable amount of practice and skill to be performed with dexterity. The instruments required for this operation are a set of O’Dwyer’s tubes, an introducer, an extractor, and a gag, but tracheotomy instruments should always be ready. The tube is cylin- drical, from 1 ^ to 2J inches long, with an expanded end which rests on the vocal cords, and having in the head a small hole to which a silk thread is attached. The tube bulges in the centre to prevent its being coughed up. The introducer is a rigid bar bent at a right angle at the end, and is provided with separate jointed extremities which fit into each tube, from which it can be detached by pressing a button in the handle. The extractor is shaped like the introducer except that at the end are two blades which can be opened out when the extractor is in the tube, by this means holding it firmly.

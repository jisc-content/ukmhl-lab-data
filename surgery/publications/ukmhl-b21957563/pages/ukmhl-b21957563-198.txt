182 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE sphincter (see p. 178). A director is passed through the ex- ternal opening and along the fistula, the canal being carefully and gently probed until the opening into the rectum is found ; while doing this considerable help is obtained if a finger is passed into the rectum, the internal opening may be felt, when the finger will serve as a guide to the probe. The end of the director, passing through the internal opening and projecting into the rectum, is hooked down by the finger and brought outside the anus, so that the portion of tissue between the two ends of the director is exposed. A cut is then made through this tissue down to the director, opening up the fistula from Fig. 95. Section of anal canal showing blind external (a) and internal (b) fistulae. end to end; as a rule this cut will divide only the external sphincter. The next step is one of the most important in the operation, but is one which is frequently omitted; it consists of exploring the fistulous track and thoroughly laying open every branch and pit leading from it, but the sphinctci must be divided only once. In order to deal with all the diseased tissues in this manner, the main track of the fistula is care- fully examined with the aid of a probe, for side openings ; if one is found a director is passed down it, if it has an external opening the director is pushed through and the tissues div ided down to the director; if there is no external opening, the

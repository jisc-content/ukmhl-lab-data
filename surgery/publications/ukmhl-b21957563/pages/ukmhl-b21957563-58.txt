OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 42 tissues, and not the tumour, are incised. When the sub- cutaneous naevus is too large for excision, there is practically nothing to he done hut to protect it. When the cutaneous naevus is too large for excision, consideration will have to he given to repeated partial electrolysis, scarification, treatment hy X-rays, &c.; or, perhaps, to repeated partial excisions with skin grafting. A certain number of naevi become cured spontaneously, so that if a naevus shows no sign of increasing, or even fades, and is in a situation that does no harm, it can he watched safely; hut if it shows signs of increase, and par- ticularly if it is soft, protuberant and bright red, or is situated on the scalp, face, genitals, &c, where it will he exposed to irritation or injury, it should he removed as soon as possible. There are certain situations in which it is particularly impor- tant to make no delay in treatment, because of the possibility of disastrous consequences. Naevi over a fontanelle may extend to the dura mater; hy the eye, they may extend deeply into the orbital fat; over the parotid region, they may extend deeply into the parotid gland, around the branches of the facial nerve. For excising large naevi it is best to administer a general anaesthetic, but small ones can be removed without any, or under a local anaesthetic such as eueaine. It must be remembered, however, that the young are bad subjects for local anaesthesia. ELECTROLYSIS OF NAEVI In situations where excision is impracticable, such as the lip, eyelid, &câ€ž or where the naevus is too large for excision, the most satisfactory method of treatment is by means of electro- lysis, a constant current being used and the needles attached to both poles inserted into the naevus; if small, however, only the positive pole should be used, the negative pole being attached to a flat pad moistened with salt solution, which is placed on any convenient part of the body, spine, buttock, arm, &c., its position being altered from time to time; The

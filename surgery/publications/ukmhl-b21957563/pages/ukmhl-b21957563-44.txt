CHAPTER II ANAESTHETICS Anaesthetics can be divided into two main divisions, Local and General. For some small operations local anaesthetics are preferable from the patient’s point of view. There is, as a rule, a great dread of a general anaesthetic, as it causes more discomfort and the patient takes a considerable time to recover. But on the other hand local anaesthetics are very uncertain in action, and generally some pain is felt. From the practitioner’s point of view the general anaesthetic is the better; he does his work more thoroughly and is not hampered by the movement of the patient or by the fear of causing pain, and there is very much less shock. General anaesthetics make operations easier, and local anaesthetics make them more difficult. It can be laid down as a genei-al rule that an operation involving dissection should not be performed under a local anaesthetic, unless, owing to the patient’s condition, a general one is contraindicated. Local Anaesthesia. There are three main methods of in- ducing local anaesthesia. 1. Freezing. This is done by spraying the part with ether, ethyl chloride, anaestile, &c., and so freezing it. The tube is held a few inches off the skin, so that the fluid falls as a fine spray on to the operation area; in a few minutes, when the skin has become white and frozen, the incision can be made. This method should be employed only when a simple incision is required, e.g. opening a superficial abscess, as the tissues become very hard, and it is impossible to perform any operation involving skill or dissection. The thawing causes considerable pain, and the frozen tissues may not heal well, being apt to slough.

51 THE HEAD manent. The needle is withdrawn, and the hair, which should offer no resistance, is gently pulled away with epila- tion forceps. In this manner many hairs can be destroyed, but those close together should never be removed at the same sitting, as the necrosed areas might join and the scar become permanent. A cooling lotion should be applied to the part, which will look l'ed and be covered with a scab, in a week, however, it will have the appearance of normal skin. This little operation should be spread over many sittings, a few hairs being done at each. ADENOMATA OP THE LIP The tumours previously described under this title are now known to possess, in many cases, the pathological character of the ‘mixed tumours’, or endotheliomata. They are hard and movable, usually situated in the lower lip, and can be readily removed through an incision in the mucous membrane. The cut edges of the lip should be united by means of silk stitches. No dressing should be employed, but the patient should frequently wash out his mouth with an antiseptic solution.

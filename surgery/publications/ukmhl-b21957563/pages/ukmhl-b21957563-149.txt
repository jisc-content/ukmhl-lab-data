133 MALE GENITOURINARY ordinary use, and have the advantage that they can be sterilized by boiling. Before a catheter is passed it is a good practice to inject about a drachm of warm oil into the urethra; vaseline is of no use as a lubricant for this form of catheter; sterilized paraffin is excellent, though more difficult to obtain. In nervous patients spasm of the urethra may impede the passage of the catheter; but this can be overcome if 10 minims of a five per cent, solution of cocaine, with 10 minims of a ten per cent, solution of adrenalin, are first injected into the urethra. This injection is extremely useful, as it diminishes the hyperaemia and swelling of the urethral mucous membrane, which is present in the retention of acute gonorrhoea, or has caused the closure of the passage in an old tortuous stricture. If a stricture is present, it is best to pass a catheter down to the stricture and inject the cocaine and adrenalin through the catheter on to the obstruction; in a few minutes it may be possible to pass a catheter through a stricture which previously could not be overcome. Suprarenal extract does not answer as well as adrenalin. Gum-elastic catheters are stiffer and more tapering than the rubber, and are consequently more easily passed, but in the practice of men who use urethral instruments frequently, it will be found that if they cannot use a rubber catheter they prefer a metal one; the curve is useful and the rigidity renders them easier to guide, and they can be sterilized by boiling. They can be passed in the same manner as sounds (see p. 134), but in using the smaller sizes great care must be taken to avoid making a false passage. DILATATION OF A STRICTURE Experience with sounds teaches us that the instruments best adapted for narrow strictures do not make the best models for completing the dilatation to a large size; the most satisfactory sounds to employ are, however, those with the use of which the operator is most familiar. For those who

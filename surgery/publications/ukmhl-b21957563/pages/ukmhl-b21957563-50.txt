34 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE L Always sec that the mask fits the face closely, a badly- fitting face piece admits air round the edges, and in conse- quence the patient does not go under easily. 2. Always make certain that the cylinder contains sufficient gas for the administration; it is a good plan to keep two cylinders, one of which is always full; if one runs out the other can be used. If during the administration both cylinders are found to have become empty, allow the patient to breathe in and out of the gas bag; anaesthesia can be induced by this means, but the method is not very satis- factory. 3. When refilling the bag, never let the gas rush in; it should be allowed to enter slowly. METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION OF ETHER PRECEDED BY NITROUS OXIDE Many different forms of apparatus have been devised for the administration of gas and ether; but the practitioner should select one particular form and make himself thoroughly acquainted with it. A description of the method of adminis- tration with a Cloverâ€™s inhaler fitted for nitrous oxide and ether is now given. The apparatus consists of a face piece fitting on to a metal receptacle for the ether, and at the other end of this receptacle is a large bag for holding the gas. At the entrance to the gas bag is a stopcock which is so arranged that the patient can breathe air alone, gas alone, or a mixture of both. When air is inspired it passes through the metal receptacle over the surface of the ether, the proportion of air passing over being indicated by a pointer outside the appa- ratus. When this pointer stands at 0, no air enters the ether chamber ; when at 2, one-half of the air inspired is passing over the ether; when at 4 (full), all the air is passing over the ether. When the patient has been thoroughly prepared (see p. 274) and examined, he is laid on the table in the dorsal recumbent position, the head being slightly raised and turned to one side. Having seen that there are no tight

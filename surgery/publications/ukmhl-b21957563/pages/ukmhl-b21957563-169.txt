They disappear under cleanliness and such local applications as calomel or a mixture of equal parts of starch and boracic acid; but if not, they should be cut off by a pair of scissors and the stump touched with caustic, silver nitrate or nitric acid. The part must be kept clean and dry.

The warts are infective and can spread along the penis or to the vulva from sexual intercourse. c. x

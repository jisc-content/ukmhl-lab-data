GENERAL 2 7 grotesque. Thus, the interpretation to be based on the skia- graph of an old fracture is extremely difficult to appraise. Is it a bad result for a fracture of that kind and in that situation, or not ? Is it the result of muscular action on that particular fracture or not? It is very hard to expect an X-ray expert to pronounce an opinion which can be regarded as authoritative, let alone a ‘ pi’actical surgeon who rarely sees the after-results of his treatment in a skiagraph. To return to the practical side of the question, we have known patients who have recovered from a fracture with very considerable deformity, have perfectly useful limbs. Anatomical accuracy is not necessary for good, if not very good, physiological value. Operative treatment should be adopted in difficult cases in certain situations—we would especially mention a Pott’s fracture; but, in general, it is yet to be proved necessary for the future usefulness that may reasonably be expected in the case of a broken limb. If a man or woman has the misfortune to break a bone, by that accident he will have robbed himself of an amount of usefulness in the limb of which the broken bone forms part; which amount will vary with the character and situation of that particular fracture. It is not known, and is very difficult to decide, how much of the resulting deformity is dependent upon the nature of the fracture or the treatment adopted. Skiagraphs are certainly of very doubtful assistance in forming an opinion, and their introduction into the law courts in the character of ‘ sure evidence ’ is an abuse of the method.

124 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE tube is pushed on, the patient being directed to swallow from time to time ; as soon as the tube enters the stomach, gas escapes with a gurgling noise through the funnel, which is held at a lower level than the stomach. By the contraction of the stomach the contents fill the tube and are siphoned out; if necessary they can be kept for analysis. The funnel is then raised above the level of the mouth and filled with warm saline solution or sterilized water; the fluid runs through the funnel into the stomach, but before it has all disappeared the funnel is lowered and the stomach contents, mixed with the lotion, well up and are poured away. This process of siphonage is repeated until the fluid returned is quite clear, when the tube is withdrawn. In certain cases the stomach requires to be washed out very frequently, and it will be found that some patients can be taught to do this for themselves. Stomach washing has been strongly recommended by Dr. Robert Hutchison for the gastric disturbances of children. The smallest oesophageal bougie can be passed down the oesophagus of a baby. Warm water, with a drachm of bicarbonate of soda to the pint, is used. SUBPERITONEAL LIPOMATA Subperitoneal lipomata are most frequently met with in the course of operations in the hernial regions. Apart from this, one or more are occasionally encountered as small, circumscribed, fatty tumours, which have perforated the aponeurosis of the linea alba above the umbilicus. They are often the cause of dragging pains in the abdomen, associated with sickness, so that it is best to remove them. When an anaesthetic has been administered and the part cleansed, an incision is made over and down to the tumour, extending at least an inch above and an inch below the swelling. The skin edges are undercut, the lipoma is exposed and the margins of the opening in the aponeui'osis defined. The tumour is then removed: it will require a few touches with the knife

Assistant Surgeon to St. Thomas’s Hospital; Senior Assistant Surgeon, Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, etc.; and Henry Irving Pinches, M.A., M.B. Over 175 Illustrations 15/- net. Post free, 6d. extra. The details of the many lesser operations in surgery, medicine, gynaecology, ophthalmology, otology, etc., which a medical man may elect to perform, have been collected in this work. As the large text books take no notice of such details their aggregation into one book should be a necessity for every busy general practitioner. Many illustrations have been prepared to illustrate the various points in their performance. The authors have used these lesser operations to indicate the general principles which alone will enable a man to practise surgery successfully. Specimen prospectus sent post free on application.

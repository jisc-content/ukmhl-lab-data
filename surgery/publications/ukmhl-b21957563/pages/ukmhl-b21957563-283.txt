The object of this operation is to divide and ligature the internal saphena vein just before it passes through the saphenous opening to join the femoral vein. The anaesthetic having been given, the hip and knee are flexed, and the leg externally rotated and fixed with a sand bag; the skin is then cleansed, and a slightly oblique incision about 3 inches in length is made. This incision commences about Fig. 168.

The vein is clamped above and below with artery forceps, the intervening portion being removed and the two

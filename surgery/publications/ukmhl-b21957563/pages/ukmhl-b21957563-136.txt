120 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE can rely on his technique. The fingers need not and should not be put into the wound. LUMBAR PUNCTURE Lumbar puncture is useful both for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. It enables us to examine the cerebro- spinal fluid, and, if necessary, to inject reagents into the spinal canal. As from the nature of the operation it is obvious that if any septic matter is introduced, in all proba- bility the patient will die, special care must be taken with the sterilizing. The needle should be longer and stouter than the ordinary hypodermic needle, which is very liable to be broken by any sudden movement of the patient. The patient should either be seated with the body bent forward or lie curled up on his side with the back flexed in order to Fig. 62. Syringe for lumbar puncture.

The lumbar region is selected for the puncture, as the spinal cord reaches only as far as the first lumbar vertebra, whilst the membranes run down into the sacrum. A local injection of eucaine or of eucaine and adrenalin can be given with advantage, but in the case of children it is better to administer a little chloroform. The position of the spine of the fourth lumbar vertebra must be determined; a straight line drawn between the highest points of the iliac crests touches the spinous process of the fourth lumbar vertebra. When the syringe has been boiled and the patients skin cleansed, the needle is entered just below the third lumbar spine, about a third of an inch to one side of the middle line; then gently pushed straight in.

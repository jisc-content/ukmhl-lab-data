Inner side of knee. Black curved line indicates incision for raising skin-flap to remove a foreign body. 3. After the first incision use the knife very sparingly, a probe is a more useful instrument. 4. In the hand and foot always remember the situation of the main arteries and nerves, and avoid cutting them. 5. Be gentle when sponging, and sparing with the use of retractors. These small operations are frequently great tests of patience and skill. Many of the superficial bodies can be removed under a local anaesthetic, such as eucainc, instead of a general anaesthetic; an additional advantage being that the patient can often help the surgeon by telling him when the foreign body is touched.

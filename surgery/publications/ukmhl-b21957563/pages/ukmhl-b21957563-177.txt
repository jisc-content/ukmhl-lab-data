FEMALE GENITOURINARY 161 and rubbed with spirit. The carunculae are seized with forceps and snipped away with blunt-pointed scissors. All haemorrhage is controlled and the cut edges are coapted by a few rectangular catgut stitches. All the carunculae which require treatment are dealt with in a similar manner. The vagina is then douched and lightly packed with gauze besprinkled with some antiseptic powder. The vulva is powdered and covered with a pad of antiseptic wool, maintained in position by a T-bandage. If there is any inflammation the patient must use a warm hip-bath for removing the plug and for micturition. The vaginal plug should be changed daily at first and discontinued after a few days. VULVAL WARTS Vulval warts usually disappear under local applications; if, however, this method fails, or if the warts are large, they should be removed. An anaesthetic is administered, the part shaved and cleansed, and the warts cut off with scissors curved on the flat, as close to the skin as possible. All bleeding points are ligatured and the wound dressed with iodoform gauze, over this a firm pad of wool is placed, and the whole kept in position with a T-bandage. Vaginal douches are given daily until the part heals. A useful adjunct to the convalescence is for the patient to sit for some time in a warm bath night and morning. cysts of bartiiolin’s gland Cysts of Bartholin’s gland form small, tense or fluctuating tumours in the posterior part of the labia majora, and are caused by an obstruction in the duct of the gland. When small, they should be removed by excision. When the patient has been anaesthetized, the labia shaved, the vagina washed out, and the external parts thoroughly cleansed, an incision is made through the skin over the cyst, and parallel to the labium. A few touches with the knife will expose the surface of the cyst, which should be shelled out entire by

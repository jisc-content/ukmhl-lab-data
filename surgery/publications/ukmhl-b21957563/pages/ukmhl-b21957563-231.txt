THE LIMBS. GENERAL 215 septicity of the arm is no guarantee of the possessor’s immunity from smallpox. southey’s tubes In certain cases of oedema of the lower limbs which does not respond to general treatment, and where the amount of fluid is great, relief can frequently be obtained by the use of Southey’s tubes, which are an improvement on the former practice of making several small incisions in the limb. The apparatus consists of several fine cannulae with lateral open- ings in their lower parts, and of a trocar which fits them. The instruments are sterilized and the limb cleansed. The 'Mtea Fro. 119. Southey’s trocar and cannulae. skin is then stabbed at right angles to the surface with the trocar and cannula, which are made to enter as far as the cellular tissues. The trocar alone is withdrawn and a fine piece of india-rubber tubing fitted on to the end of the cannula ; the other end of the tubing is led off into a receptacle. Three or more tubes are introduced in this manner, each being packed round with gauze. They are left in position until sufficient fluid has been withdrawn, and then removed; the punctures being sealed with small pieces of gauze and collo- dion. Unfortunately, the serum clots and blocks the tubes, so that the result of using them is often disappointing, and the practitioner has to fall back upon making one or two small aseptic incisions.

THE NECK 91 pharynx examined with the finger. It is more frequent to find these abscesses extending round to one side of the pharynx than directly symmetrical behind it. The abscess should be opened on the side to which it extends; if it is symmetrical it can be opened on the side which is most convenient to the operator, generally the patientâ€™s right. Fig. 46.

TENOTOMY AND MYOTOMY OF THE STERNOMASTOID Owing to a partial rupture of the sternomastoid during birth, the muscle undergoes a certain amount of local cicatriza- tion, which by its contraction and its interference with the growth of the part causes torticollis in many of the cases. As with tonsils and adenoids, the mere operation is not enough for success, the part which has been operated upon having to be made functional by means of nasal respiratory exercises. Similarly, in a case of torticollis, division of the sternomastoid is insufficient for success ; the operation having to be followed by a course of exercises and massage, to render the divided muscle strong and useful. Moreover, time has to elapse before the vertebrae grow straight again; because, whilst the torti- collis has existed, the bodies of the vertebrae have grown misshapen and wedge-shaped. Thus the operation must be followed by exercises and massage, which must be persevered

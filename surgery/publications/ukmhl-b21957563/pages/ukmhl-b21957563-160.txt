144 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE from the stump. If the testis on the affected side hangs very much lower than the other, the two stumps can be united by passing a stitch through them on the distal sides of the ligatures, which should not be tied together. The two stumps should not be united in a candidate for the public services, as the subsequent continuity of the structures of the cord has been known to give rise to the idea that the opera- tion has been ‘ unsuccessful ’ and the candidate has been re- jected after all. It is sometimes desirable to close part of the external abdominal ring, and this can be done with one or two silk stitches. All bleeding points are ligatured and the wound closed with interrupted stitches, and dressed with gauze and collodion. The stitches are removed in a week, and the patient allowed up ten days after the operation if the wound has healed. A suspensory bandage should be worn for a few weeks to support the scrotum. In certain cases of pendulous scrotum, some of the skin can be excised with advantage. This operation should only be done when the patient com- plains of symptoms which are due directly to the varicocele; in which case over ninety per cent, will be relieved if not cured. For reference to some of the consequences and after- results of this operation, the reader is referred to a paper on ‘ The Immediate and Remote Results of the High Operation for Varicocele’, in the British Medical Journal, January 27, 1906. HYDROCELE The simple tapping of a hydrocele will relieve it temporarily, but the fluid usually re-forms; if, however, the tapping is followed by the injection of an irritant, there is no doubt that a large percentage of cases will be cured. The best substance to inject is carbolic acid liquefied with glycerine, in the pro- portion of 10 parts of the acid to 1 of glycerine. Iodine is sometimes used, but the above mixture causes less pain and is more certain. When tapping a hydrocele the patient should

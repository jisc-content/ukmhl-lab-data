OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 22 No one would suggest such treatment for suppuration in the neck or under the periosteum. Therefore our advice for the treatment of a case of postoperative suppuration would be:— 1. Open up the skin wound sufficiently to expose fully the suppurating area. If the whole wound is suppurating, the whole skin wound must he opened up; if it is only sup- purating in part, only part need be opened up. 2. Make no more delay in doing this than you would in incising an acute abscess or cellulitis elsewhere; and make counter openings if necessary. 3. Dress the suppurating wound with hot dry dressings which are changed frequently. Wet dressings make the part sodden; it is the heat that does good, fiot the wetness or the minute quantity of antiseptic present. 4. If more is required, place the part in a hot bath or wash it out with a syringe. That is to say, put your trust in mechanical flushing and not in chemical action. 5. As soon as the hardness and surrounding inflammation have subsided, discontinue the hot dressings. 6. If the suppuration is on a limb, employ Bier’s congestion treatment, p. 220. Lord Lister was the first great man to show how to prevent suppuration; Professor Bier is one of the first to tell us a good way of treating it after it has occurred. 7. Convalescence must be prolonged until the wound is soundly healed. Any sinuses must be opened up and any septic dead material, such as necrotic tissue or a stitch, removed. 8. Remember that some damage has always been done by the suppuration, but it is not known, and cannot be known at this sta^e what is its extent. The amount of damage done varies very much; sometimes it is practically none, and sometimes it is practically very great. The danger of suppuration varies with the situations in which it occurs. It is most dangerous when associated with large veins which have been ligatured; such as after

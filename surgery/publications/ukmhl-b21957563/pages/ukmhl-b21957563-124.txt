108 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE left intact. All bleeding points must be ligatured; this is especially important, as blood will tend to collect in the ‘ dead ’ space left by the removal of the breast. The skin edges are carefully united by interrupted sutures. It is sometimes advisable to leave a very small glass drainage tube in one end of the wound, or to leave one suture at the end of the wound untied, in order to allow any blood which accumulates to escape. The tube is removed or the stitch tied within twenty- four hours. The wound must be dressed with a firm pad in order to obliterate the cavity left behind; the arm should be only bandaged to the side for two days. The stitches ai'e removed a week after the operation. This operation should never be done when there is any question of malignant disease of the breast. For reasons explained in the earlier part of this book, opei’ations for malignant disease are not discussed. CYSTS OF TPIE BREAST are of many kinds. Except when they are merely localized signs of a widespread mastitis they should be dissected out and removed. To do this little need be added to what has already been said Avhen describing the removal of adenomata of the breast. At times an area of mastitis containing two or more cysts can be removed with great benefit. The older method of tapping and injecting these cysts is much inferior to the more modern one of excision ; moreover, there is the possibility of there being present some intracystic growth, probably a duct carcinoma, and this would not be discovered by tapping and injecting.

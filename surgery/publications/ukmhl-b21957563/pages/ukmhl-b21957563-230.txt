214 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE VACCINATION Vaccination is usually performed on the upper arm, but in the case of female children it is often done on the upper part of the leg, as the scar on the arm is apt to show. The left arm is usually selected, except in left-handed patients, and is cleansed with soap and water, and then rubbed with methy- lated spirit; mercurial solutions should not be used as they are apt to inhibit the action of the vaccine. A needle is rendered sterile by heating it in the flame, the skin over the insertion of the deltoid is put upon the stretch and scarified in not less than four places in the pattern of a network. The scratches should only just draw blood, if the haemorrhage is considerable, the blood should be washed off and the part dried. A little of the lymph is then blown out by means of Fig. 118. Rubber bulb for ejecting vaccine. a small india-rubber bulb which fits the tube, as a rule the india-rubber top of a fountain-pen filler can be made to answer the purpose, on to each of these areas. It is rubbed in with the needle, and then allowed to dry. If any dressing is applied, a simple pad of boracic lint fixed on with strapping is as satisfactory as any. This pad is changed at the end of a week, and more frequently as the scabs form. The scabs will usually fall off in about three weeks from the date of vaccination. If there is much reaction, the arm should be worn in a sling; if vaccinated on the leg the patient must lie up. Children are as a rule vaccinated before they are four months old ; they should be revaccinated when about fifteen. It is a noteworthy fact that the worst arms are the most septic, not the best vaccinated, and that the most * successful â€™ vac- cinators are often the most septic in their operations. The

OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 132 forwards, with running water from the tap, then immersed for half an hour in methylated spirit, dried, and stored dry. The value of dry storing can be seen in the everyday life of old men who lead a ‘ catheter life’, they keep their catheters in an old cigarette or tobacco case in their pocket, and go on from month to month using the same catheter many times daily, no antiseptics are employed, yet they seldom get cystitis; it is the dry storing which saves them. Hence the importance of dry storing, rather than the use of carbolic acid or other antiseptics, should be impressed on all those who lead a catheter life; the catheters will last far longer and the patients run far less risk of contracting cystitis. The following rules should be observed :—- 1. The catheter should be kept dry in a special, dry, clean case; these can be obtained from any surgical instru- ment maker. 2. Before use the instrument should be softened by immersing it in warm water, and if necessary lubricated with vaseline. 3. After using the instrument the grease should be removed and the catheter well washed, both inside and outside, and backwards and forwards, under running water, dried, and returned to its case. 4. If there is any difficulty in removing the grease, it should be done with methylated spirit. 5. Above all, the patient should avoid soiling the catheter or his fingers with as much care as he courts cleanliness. Dry unclean hands do far less harm than wet imperfectly clean ones. 6. The hands and the penis should always be washed im- mediately before using the catheter. 7. The catheter should be discarded as soon as it begins to wear. The actual passing of a catheter needs practice rather than written precept, yet a few suggestions may not be out ol place. The rubber catheters (Jacques’) are the best for

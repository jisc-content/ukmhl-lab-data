88 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE is a very common mistake to slip the tube into the oesophagus. Removal. If the silk thread is present, slight traction on it will succeed in removing the tube. If the silk is not present, a gag is introduced, and the left index finger is placed on the upper end of the tube; the extractor with the blades closed is passed down the side of the finger, and its end introduced into the aperture at the top of the tube; the blades are then opened and the tube withdrawn. The drawbacks to intubation are that the tube is frequently coughed out and requires reintroducing; and that it interferes with deglutition, allowing fluids to enter the trachea, to prevent which it is best to give only semisolid food or, if this fails, to feed through the nose. In fact, whilst intuba- tion is a proceeding of much use in institutions and hospitals where plenty of skilled assistance can be quickly obtained, it is not likely to be of use to a busy practitioner who cannot always be within call. FOREIGN BODIES IN THE LARYNX When a foreign body has become impacted in the larynx, it may or may not cause urgent dyspnoea. If there is no dyspnoea, attempts should be made to remove the foreign body via the mouth with laryngeal forceps aided by a laryngo- scope. If the dyspnoea is urgent the practitioner may be forced to do a tracheotomy or laryngotomy. But having done this he will have to decide whether it is advisable for him to attempt to remove the foreign body. If he determines to proceed further, a probe or director is passed through the wound in the trachea, up the larynx. A gag is placed in the mouth, and a finger inserted to catch the body as it is pushed up with the probe into the pharynx. If this fails it may be necessaiâ€™y to divide the thyroid cartilage in the middle line, thyrotomy, subsequently divaricating its alae and examining the interior of the larynx. Having removed the foreign body, the thyroid cartilage is united by silk

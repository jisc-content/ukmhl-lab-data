OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 68 or normal saline. This is clone by directing the patient to lean forward over a basin while keeping the mouth wide open; then, whatever is syringed up one nostril will return down the other. The patient should be taught to acquire the habit of nasal respiration, in order to keep the nose and nasopharynx clean and well-ventilated, so lessening the chances of a recurrence of the condition. FURUNCLES IN THE EXTERNAL AUDITORY MEATUS Furuncles in the external auditory meatus require incision under gas; after operation the ear should be lightly packed with gauze soaked in boracic lotion, and this should be changed daily. Hot fomentations are very comforting. The patient must be warned that the condition is apt to recur. PASSAGE OF THE EUSTACHIAN CATHETER There are several ways of doing this, but the following is the method recommended. The catheter, having been sterilized, is held lightly between the thumb and first finger and is passed, with its concavity turned downwards, directly up one nostril until the end of the catheter impinges on the posterior pharyngeal wall. It is then turned inwards, and withdrawn, until it catches against the posterior edge of the nasal septum. If it is now held firmly and rotated through a right angle, i.e. until the end is directed upwards and out- wards, it will enter the mouth of the Eustachian tube, where its presence may be confirmed, if necessary, by means of the ‘ diagnostic tube ’.

254 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE removed in a week, but the splint should be retained for another week; at the end of which period the patient is allowed to walk. Suppuration sometimes occurs in the prepatellar bursa, and the condition should be relieved by making a median incision, under gas. A counter opening should be made at the most dependent point, when desirable, by cutting down on a director passed through the first incision. An india-rubber tube can be passed through the two incisions to act as a drain, and the wound dressed with hot fomentations, which are changed frequently. EXCISION OP A SEMIMEMBRANOSUS BURSA This bursa lies under the tendon of the semimembranosus muscle and often has a connection with the knee joint. When enlarged, it increases in size along the line of least resistance, i.e. upwards along the tendon of the semimembranosus, to form a swelling on the back and inner side of the popliteal space. Before proceeding to operation, ascertain if the enlargement of the bursa is merely the result of chronic articular disease in the knee or not. Because, if it is secondary to some chronic arthritis of the knee, there being a connection between the joint and the bursa, it is likely that there will be a recurrence of the swelling after opera- tion, which will prove a failure, disappointing both surgeon and patient. A general anaesthetic is most satisfactory, the patient lying in the prone or semiprone position, when he must be on the side of the leg to be operated on. After cleansing the skin, an incision is made over and a little longer than, the swelling. The strong popliteal fascia is incised and the subjacent swelling becomes obvious. The wound is held open with retractors and the cyst defined with a blunt dissector, not the handle of the knife. The retractors, perhaps three in number, are inserted more deeply as the swelling is defined. It is easier to separate it from the sur-

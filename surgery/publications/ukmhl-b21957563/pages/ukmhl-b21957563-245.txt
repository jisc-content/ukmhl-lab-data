229 THE ARM is then cut through by means of bone forceps. The distal portion of the bone is lifted up and the knife passed beneath it, along its palmar surface, cutting towards the tip of the fingers as in the previous operation. When a sufficiently long flap has been defined, the knife is made to cut through the skin transversely. In this manner a rectangular palmar flap is obtained. If the remaining part of the phalanx has no muscles attached to it, it will be flail and useless. To prevent this, the tendons are secured with artery forceps, before being divided, and cut long; they are then sutured together over the stump of the bone or to their tendon sheaths; particular care should be given to the flexor tendons (Fig. 132). This will ensure the patient having some control over the stump. The haemorrhage is stopped and the flaps stitched in position. The dressing is the same as that in amputation of the terminal phalanx. AMPUTATION AT THE METACAEPO-PIIALANGEAL JOINT In performing this amputation the question will have to be decided as to whether or not the head of the metacarpal bone should be removed. It is better, if possible, not to remove it, as its presence ensures a stronger and more service- able hand. The only drawback to retaining it is that the hand is more unsightly than if it had been removed. The finger is held by the end and the others flexed at the meta- carpo-phalangeal joint and held on one side by an assistant. The incision is commenced at the middle of the dorsum above the knuckle, is continued along the centre of the dorsum over the knuckle, then curves round between the affected finger and the next one, appearing on the palmar surface, which it crosses transversely in the crease at the root of the finger, and comes round on the other side of the finder to join the original incision on the dorsum; thus making a racquet-shaped incision. At first, the knife should cut through skin and fat alone, marking out the incision. The

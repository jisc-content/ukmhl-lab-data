166 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE 3. The urethral orifice is then inspected for caruncles, painful tags of mucous membrane, urethritis, ulcers, &c. 4. The vaginal orifice is examined for inflamed caruncles, tags of mucous membrane, ulcers, &c. Let it be borne in mind that there is a condition which can be called fissure in vagina, which corresponds to the well-known fissure in ano. There is also a similar, but naturally less common, condition in the urethra, fissure in urethra. 5. The perineum is then inspected. 6. Finally the anus is inspected for fissures, fistulae, or piles. Each region is inspected on a regular and orderly plan, so that nothing is missed. Each possible cause is treated as is required. Finally, both the anal and vaginal orifices are stretched with the fingers and thumbs. Deep anaesthesia is required. In severe or recurrent cases, it is sometimes desirable to divide the sphincter vaginae muscle with a knife. This can be done either by one incision made backwards in the middle line; or a lateral one made backwards and outwards on either side of the middle line. When all has healed soundly, the parts should again be inspected under anaesthesia to ascertain if all is as it should be, and that nothing has been overlooked. The patient should be sent on a holiday before returning to her husband. It is very disastrous for the patientâ€™s mental condition to send her back improperly cured. CERVICAL rOLYPI Polypi are occasionally found springing from the cervix; they usually give rise to a discharge, and, wherever possible, should be removed. There are several varieties: the mucous polypus, which is often cystic, the placental, and the fibroid. As a rule, in dealing with these tumours no anaesthetic is required. The vagina is douched, the external parts washed, and the cervix pulled down with a volsellum, when the small

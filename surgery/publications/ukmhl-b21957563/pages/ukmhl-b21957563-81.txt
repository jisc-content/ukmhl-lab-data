65 THE I-IEAD the frenum is extremely short, and the child unable to suckle (the mother’s nipples being healthy), it should be divided. A small transverse cut should be made near the symphysis and the tongue pulled up, so as to enlarge the incision. A RANULA is a mucous cyst in the floor of the mouth, and, it" small, can be easily removed. The surface of the tumour is painted with eucaine, steadied with forceps, and cut into with sharp-pointed scissors; the cyst wall is then grasped with forceps, and pulled away entire. The essential point in the operation is that the whole of the cyst wall should be removed. If the cyst wall cannot be wholly removed, as much as possible must be cut away, and any left behind curetted and painted with silver nitrate (4 grains to the ounce) to destroy it. It is useless to plug the wound. Mouth washes are to be used frequently in the after-treatment. If the tumour is large it will require an extensive operation to remove it thoroughly, and it would be best to take further advice. NASAL RESPIRATORY EXERCISES After operations for enlarged tonsils and adenoids, it is of great importance to ensure the patient’s becoming an habitual nose breather. The best way to accomplish this is by nasal respiratory exercises. At least three times a day the child should be put on its back, for about half an hour at a time, and made to breathe in and out as deeply as possible, through its nose, the mouth being kept tightly shut. This exercise should be continued daily, until the child becomes an habitual nose breather. It is sometimes difficult to get young children to do this exercise properly, and in such a case, a piece of oil silk should be tied over the mouth, thus compelling the child to breathe through the nose; this should be done for not less than half an hour at a time. Whenever the child is found to be breathing through the mouth or going about with the

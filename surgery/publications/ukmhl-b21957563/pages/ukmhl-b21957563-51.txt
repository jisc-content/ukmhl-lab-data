35 ANAESTHETICS clothes round the neck, no false teeth in the mouth, and that the patient is as comfortable as possible, try, before the apparatus is put together, if the face piece tits the patient, and if it does not, select another. The gas bag having been filled, 2 ounces of ether placed in the inhaler, and the stopcock turned so that the patient breathes air alone, the patient is instructed to breathe quietly in and out, and the mask placed firmly on the face. After a few breaths the gas is turned on fully, so that the patient inspires gas from the bag and expires it into the air; after three or four breaths the valve is turned so that the patient breathes in and out of the gas bag, and then after a few more respirations and while the patient is expiring, the ether is turned on till the pointer stands half way between the marks 0 and 1. If this causes coughing, the ether is turned off" and a few more breaths of gas given by itself; if the ether is tolerated, it is after a few respirations turned on a little more, and in this manner the percentage of ether is gradually increased till the pointer stands at about 3^ or at 4. The amount of ether should always be increased during an expiration, and the pointer must not be continually turned on but should be moved by a series of small jerks. During this time the patient is breathing gas as well as ether, but when respiration becomes stertorous, the gas bag is removed and the air bag- put in its place, giving the patient one or two breaths of air, and soon the colour improves. The point to be secured is, that when the administration of gas is stopped the patient is taking nearly a full dose of ether. If, during the stage of gas administration, the blueness becomes very marked, a few breaths of air must be allowed ; but it must be remem- bered that if much air is given in the early stages the patient will tend to come round. After the gas bag has been removed, nearly a full dose of ether should be given for some time, and when the patient is fully under and well saturated with ether, it will be found that the pointer can be turned back to about 2, or 1, or even less. During this period and for

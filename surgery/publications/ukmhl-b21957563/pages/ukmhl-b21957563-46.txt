30 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE of such drugs as cocaine, morphia, &c. It is necessary to inject the solution so that a number of bubbles are raised round and over the operation area. For this means it is claimed that even severe and pi-olonged operations can be performed without causing any pain; the chief drawback is that the oedema caused by the infiltration of the tissues renders dis- section almost impossible, consequently it has never come into general use. GENEEAL ANAESTHETICS When determining what general anaesthetic to administer to a patient many factors have to be considered, but un- doubtedly the first is the safety of the patient under the particular drug employed. Anaesthetics can be arranged as regards safety in the following order, the safest being given first:—Nitrous Oxide, Ethyl Chloride, Ether, A.C.E., Chloroform. Other factors to be considered are the age and general condition of the patient, the nature and length of the operation. Reference is made to these points under each separate anaesthetic. Nitrous Oxide, generally referred to as ‘ gas ’, can be employed for operations which will not last more than from one to two minutes, e. g. avulsion of nail, incision of abscesses, breaking down adhesions, &c. It is by far the safest of all anaesthetics and can be given to nearly all patients, but should not be used in cases of advanced cardiac or lung disease. When the inhalation is pushed, muscular spasm occurs; the admixture of a small quantity of air will sometimes, but not always, cause relaxation ; but owing to this fact it is not a satisfactory anaesthetic to employ for reducing dislocations. By administering small quantities of oxygen at the same time as nitrous oxide, anaesthesia can be prolonged, but this method requires considerable practice. Ethyl Chloride. This drug can be given in the same manner as nitrous oxide; a few cubic centimetres of the liquid are placed in the bag, this evaporates and the patient

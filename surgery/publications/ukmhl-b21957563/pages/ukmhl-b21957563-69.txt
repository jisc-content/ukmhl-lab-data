The use of the collodion on the lower lip is to draw it down and open the mouth. A warning should always be given to the nurse in charge. EPULIS An epulis is a tumour of the gums.

An anaesthetic having been given, the tooth or necrosed bone, in connection with which the growth arises, is extracted, and the tumour, with the mucous mem- brane and periosteum over which it is situated, removed. Smart haemorrhage sometimes occurs, but it can be controlled easily by means of a gauze plug, which, if necessary, can be soaked in adrenalin. No attempt should be made by the practitioner to deal with a malignant epulis, or with a case of recurrence after removal of a simple one, as these require extensive operations. THE MAXILLARY ANTRUM can be opened easily to relieve an empyema. The upper teeth, on the same side as the diseased antrum, should be examined, and treated when necessary. The old practice was to drain the antrum by boring upwards through the socket of a tooth; now it is opened through the canine fossa, the depression on the anterior surface of the superior maxilla just above the canine tooth. The upper lip is retracted, the

242 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE Catgut stitches can be used for the skin with great advantage, because they need not be removed. In the operation described, the flaps are easily brought across the base of the cleft; but frequently it is not pos- sible to close the wounds on the sides of the fingers, which, in consequence, granulate. So long as the flaps heal across the bottom of the cleft, the condition will not recur. SUPERNUMERARY DIGITS Wherever possible supernumerary digits should be treated by removal. It is sometimes doubtful which digit should be amputated, and a skiagraph will be useful in helping to form an opinion. For instance, there may be two sets of phalanges to one metacarpal bone, when it may be difficult to determine which set of phalanges to re- move. If the supernumerary digit is merely attached by skin and fibrous tissue, it can easily be cut off and the flaps united. If the bone of the proximal phalanx articulates with the metacarpal, not only must the phalanx be amputated, but the articular surface of the meta- carpal must be removed, other- mn an unsightly boss. If an extra metacarpal bone is present this must be removed together with the phalanx attached to it. REMOVING RINGS FROM THE FINGERS In some cases, owing to a lesion of the finger, a ring upon it becomes too tight and forms a constricting band which impedes the return of the venous blood, leading to oedema of the tissues distal to it. Finally, the patient seeks advice with a ring deeply embedded in the tissues of a Fig. 142. Hand with super- numerary digit. wise it might grow and

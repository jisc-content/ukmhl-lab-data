CHAPTER XII THE ARM AMrUTATION OF THE DIGITS An injury is the usual reason for which it is found necessary to amputate the fingers or portions of them. It is a cardinal rule of surgery never to remove more of the hand than is absolutely necessary; a small portion of a phalanx should he retained whenever possible, as a much more ser- viceable hand will result than if the whole phalanx had been removed. When it is doubtful if the finger should be ampu- tated or not, the doubt should be given to the patient, pro- vided that he is healthy, and the part retained; fingers torn and crushed have a wonderful recuperative power. In many cases, owing to the nature of the injury, it will not be possible to perform a formal textbook operation; and the surgeon must devise methods of his own, obtaining flaps wherever there is sound tissue. The usual tendency in all amputations is to make the flaps too short; it is far better to err in the other direction. When amputating the fingers, a general anaesthetic should be used. Many of the cases requiring amputation are caused by machinery accidents, and the hands of these patients are generally exceedingly dirty; some of the grease can be removed with turpentine before the hand is washed. In all, the hand should be thoroughly washed with soap and water, care being taken that all dirt is removed from the nails; the hand is essentially a situation where the nail-brush can be used with advantage. Finally, the part should be rubbed with methylated spirit or turpentine. The following is a short description of the more common textbook amputations done on the fingers

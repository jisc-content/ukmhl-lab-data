40 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE tions, the eyeballs fixed, the pupil moderately contracted and sensitive to light, the pulse regular and strong. In chloro- form anaesthesia special attention must be paid to the colour of the patient’s face and to the breathing; sudden paleness is often a sign of cardiac failure and the anaesthetic must be stopped ; quick, shallow respirations may mean an overdose. The remarks made under the heading of ether administration (see pp. 37 and 38) on the pulse, respirations, pupil, &c., apply with equal force to chloroform. In children, anaesthesia must be induced very slowly as it is easy to give an overdose. Occasionally a condition of so-called ‘ false anaesthesia ’ occurs, the child in reality going to sleep; the superficial reflexes are absent, the pupils contracted, and the patient may appear to be well under. When the skin incision is made the child struggles and coughs; at this stage the anaesthetic must not be pushed, as after a fit of coughing the child will take a deep breath and, if much chloroform is given, may get an overdose; the drug should be freely administered but plenty of air admitted at the same time.

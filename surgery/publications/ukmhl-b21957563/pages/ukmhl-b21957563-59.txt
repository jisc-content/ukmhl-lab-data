THE HEAD 43 positive pole is connected to one or more platinum needles, insulated to within a short distance oi" the points. A current of from 50 to 100 milliamperes should be used for from ten to fifteen minutes; in order to produce this amount of current, from ten to twenty cells will be required. An ordinary cell, such as a Leclanche, when used for electrolysis can be reckoned on as producing from 5 to 7 milliamperes. If the naevus is on the scalp not more than 50 milliamperes should be employed. It is better to give a general anaesthetic as there is a considerable amount of shock, especially in children when the naevus is over a fontanelle. The skin over the naevus is thoroughly cleansed and the needle, which has been boiled, is inserted into the edge of the tumour, care being Fig. IT. Position of needles introduced for electrolysis of a naevus. taken that the point is not too near the surface or sloughing may ensue. If more than one needle is used, see that the separate needles are kept parallel, otherwise the current is not evenly distributed. The current is turned on gradually, the position of the needles being changed from time to time. It will be noticed that the naevus becomes white in colour and that there is a little bubbling of gas round the point of the needle. The current should be reversed for a few seconds before withdrawing the needle, thus preventing any further haemorrhage. A little gauze and collodion should be used as a dressing; the collodion being put round the naevus and not on it. The immediate l'esult is that the naevus becomes firmer, but this disappears in three or four days; in a few

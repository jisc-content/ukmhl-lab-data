175 FEMALE GENITOURINARY bowels should be opened on the third day by an aperient, 2-4 ounces of olive oil being injected into the rectum by means of a tube and a funnel, just before an action is ex- pected. The stitches should be removed about one week from the operation. COMPLETE RUPTURE The preparations are similar to those mentioned in the de- scription of the operation for incomplete rupture and will not be repeated. The rectal tear must be sewn up first; catgut stitches, threaded on a medium- sized curved needle, are passed through the recto-vaginal sep- tum, commencing at the extreme end of the tear. The needle is passed from below, through the rectal wall,then over the lacera- tion and through the rectal wall on the other side; so that, when the stitch is tied, the knot is situated within the rectum. As each stitch is passed, it is tied, and the ends cut off short. This suturing of the rectal mucous membrane must be done very thoroughly, or a recto-vaginal fistula will result. The last stitch is not tied until the sphincter has been united. The two ends of the torn sphincl Fig. 90. a. Method of inserting suture to approximate the torn ends of sphincter ani muscle, b.

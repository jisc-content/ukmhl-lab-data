13 GENERAL their results. The best material to use is fine salmon-gut threaded on a sharp, round-bodied needle; an absorbable suture, such as catgut, can be used, but has very little advan- tage over the unabsorbable. The skin on one side of the wound is everted, and the needle passed longitudinally for about one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch through the subcuticular tissue, close to one end of the wound, and the gut is drawn well through. The next stitch is passed in the same way through the opposite side of the wound, a little further along, but it must overlap the first stitch; in this manner the stitching is continued on alternate sides for the whole length of the wound. No knots are tied, the wound being closed by Fig. 11 a. Method of inserting subcuticular suture, wound open. Fig. 11 6. Wound closed by subcuticular stitch. traction on the two ends of the gut, which can then be fixed, if desirable, by a small piece of gauze and collodion at either end of the wound. In theory, the wound should present a thin straight line; but in practice, it is often wrinkled. The stitch can be removed one week after its insertion, this being done by stripping the collodion from both ends, cutting off' one end of the stitch close to the wound and applying traction to the other end by means of forceps, and the whole piece of gut is pulled through ; while doing this it is best to steady the area round the wound with the fingers of the other hand. This method of suturing should never be used when there is the slightest chance of suppuration taking place. The removal of the subcuticular stitch gives the patient less discomfort than the removal of a corresponding number of interrupted stitches.

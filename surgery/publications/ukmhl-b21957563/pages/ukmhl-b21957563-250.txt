234 OPERATIONS OF GENERAL PRACTICE GANGLION A ganglion is either unilocular or multilocular. The uni- locular cysts generally arise from a tendon sheath and are usually found about the wrist. The multilocular cysts are generally in connection with joints, especially the wrist- joint ; they may extend widely and require for their removal difficult and prolonged dissection, and the practitioner would be well advised not to attempt to deal with them. Simple unilocular cysts can be treated by rupturing the sac by means of forcible pressure: often, however, owing to the thickness of the wall this method fails; and, even if suc- cessful, recurrence is very liable to take place.

When the part has been cleansed and rendered anaesthetic, a small puncture is made with a sharp tenotome at the side of the ganglion in the skin, which is drawn over the swelling so as to make the track oblique afterwards; the point of the knife is pushed through to the opposite side of the cyst wall, which it penetrates, and then a horizontal cut is made dividing the ganglion, care being taken not to injure the skin. It is no use merely to puncture the cyst, as, if this is done alone, recurrence is sure to take place. After the contents of the cyst have been squeezed out, or into the cellular tissue, the wound is dressed with

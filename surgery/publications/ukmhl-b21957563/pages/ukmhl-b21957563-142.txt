CHAPTER VIII MALE GENITOURINARY ENLARGEMENT OF THE MEATUS URINARIUS From time immemorial this operation has been clone by means of a simple incision made from the meatus towards the frenum preputii. In the adult this procedure generally fails owing to the difficulty of keeping the incision open, the frequent passage of dilators causing the patient considerable discomfort. Moreover, the wound heals insidiously from the end nearest to the frenum, in a somewhat similar wray to the web of the finger growing up again after simple incision ; and the result of the operation is that the patient is often left in a worse state after operation than before, the cica- trization having diminished yet further the size of the meatus. If the patient is a baby, or a young child, simple incision, meatotomy, is usually perfectly successful, in fact, it is more likely to be successful as a primary than as a secondary measure. Simple Incision, Meatotomy. This operation can be done under local anaesthesia, hut it is better to give a general anaesthetic. The part is cleaned, a fine tenotome passed into the meatus, and a cut made towards the frenum until the constriction is divided sufficiently to .allow the passage of a full-sized sound. While the cut is healing a sound should be passed from time to time; No. 4 or 5 will do for children of three. Plastic Operation. In the case of an adult, particularly when the stenosis is cicatricial and acquired, a small plastic operation is necessary. Two incisions are made by the side of the frenum, extending from the centre of the contracted

The effect produced by an irritant will depend first, upon the intensity of the irritant; and secondly, upon the powers of resistance of tlw tissues on which it acts : thus, in the feeble tissues of a !lDJ» which are diseased so as to bring the supply of blood below the normal standard, inflammation is readily induced by slight causes. It has a _ y been stated, that insufficient supply of blood acts as a powerful predisposing ZZot inflammation ; the complete arrest of the circulate a sufficient length of time, acts as a direct exciting cause, lh s uas shown by Cohnlieim in his well-known experiments on the tongue of the log an Z the ear of the rabbit. If the ear of the rabbit be emptied of blood, and a temporary ligature applied at its base, the effect produced is proportional to Sime during which the ear is kept bloodless ; if this be a few hours only temporary hypermmia alone results, with perhaps slight swelling ; if about Se homsflbe ear becomes greatly swollen, there is retarded flow in the vessels with abundant inflammatory exudation, and the tissues become infil- trated with migrating white blood-corpuscles ; if the ear be kept bloodless ^ritalfly^ lost the blood refuses to enter it, the corpuscles imme- tfll its Vitality is t, t^ ^ blocking them as in inflammatory stasis so diately cliokn & de°ree of inflammation can be STAwW* the ear is kept bloody.

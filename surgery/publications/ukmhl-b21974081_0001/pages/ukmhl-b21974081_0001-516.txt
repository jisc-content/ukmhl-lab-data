4S4 INJURIES OF NERVES, MUSCLES, AND TENDONS. of the shoulder-joint. In this case the accident arose from severe dragging upon the arm by the reins of a runaway horse. In division of the Extensor Tendons of the Fingers—a very common accident—the tendons should, if possible, be sutured, and the hand must be kept extended on a straight splint for three weeks, until perfect union has taken place. The Flexor Tendons of the fingers may also be divided. In these cases the phalanges cannot be bent, the fingers stretching out straight. The only treatment consists in flexing the finger fully into the palm of the hand, where it must be re- tained by strips of plaster. Laceration of the Rectus Abdominis Muscle may occur in the efforts of childbirth, or from blows upon the abdominal wall; a ventral hernia being the consequence. Guthrie relates several remarkable cases occurring in military practice, of progressive atrophy of a part of the muscular wall of the ab- domen following blows. Rider’s Sprain may occur in two situations— in the adductors, and in the internal rotators of the femur. It is more commonly met with in the adductors. It consists in a laceration of some of the muscular fibres or of the fascia covering the muscles. It is due to a violent or spasmodic contraction of these muscles when the rider is m danger of losing his seat. The pain is very great. The grip is lost and the sufferer is unable to ride. When the internal rotators, or some of the capsular muscles of the hip-joint are the seats of the sprain, the pain and disability are referred to the back of the trochanter • The Treatment consists in rest, and the use of a spica strap or bandage, with a pad over the injured muscle, so as to compress it and control its action. jrig. 171.—Atrophy of Capsular Muscles of Shoulder.

INF LAMM A TOR Y FE VER. *79 part affected be of great importance, as the larynx or the kidney, the general symptoms are proportionally severe. The nature of the inflammation and of its cause exerts more influence, than any other condition in the constitu- tional effects, simple traumatic inflammation gives rise to symptoms of slight severity and short duration ; while septic and infective inflammations may prove fatal hy the disturbance they cause in the system generally rather than by then- local effects. Thus a simple fracture, although followed bv considerable inflammatory swelling, causes but slight constitutional dis- turbance; while a poisoned wound may prove fatal, though the local inflam- mation may affect only the last phalanx of a finger. The constitutional disturbance in inflammation always assumes the form of fever Inflammatory or Symptomatic Fever.—Inflammatory fever is invariably secondary, being a consequence of the local affection It is thus clearly distinguished from the so-called “essential” fevers, in which the febrile condition occurs either without any local inflammation or precedes the local affection by a distinct interval, as in the acute specific diseases The one essential symptom of. all forms of fever is elevation of the temperature of the body, 01 pyrexia; without this, fever cannot be said to be present It is impossible here to discuss the theories as to the nature of fever but tlm &W maybG giYen ^ ^’a%a^l *P<m and com^’nto all ished loir ‘mil production of heat, not merely a dimin- sucb « the disappearanceGof ftt tl“ ^feTo/the'^r “™e-chimSe> excretion of area and carbonic add TlZ ® tho ““'eased the loss of water by the lungs,'and often alsl tm\“ that m some cases, such as the rigor following operations 'nwif P !> e probably moTactiv^n^the0^ P?ace tiu'ou^°tit the body, beino- -t de/eloped ^ stated, the latest observationstad to , v "tw ^ as before temjierature beyond that of tho hi wl ■ L lat tbere ls 110 elevation of supposing thatSXS^ P^t actually inflamed ; and, even m detecting it, that the heat developed in tlmVrea of^fl ^ difficuIt>r in extremely small nmmmf nn i -r • _ clca ol inflammation must be of the tem^e^rVTlttrs!°ienf l,° ac“"nt “» elevation caused by the min nonoii oocly by several degrees.

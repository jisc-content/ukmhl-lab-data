INCISIONS. 39 should be carefully avoided. An ordinary wound is gradually deepened by simply drawing the knife along it, with its edge directed downwards and parallel to the incision, until the deep fascia is reached. As the wound is deepened it is, if necessary, held open by an assistant with blunt hooks or spatulas. The division of the deep fascia often requires care, as important structures may lie beneath, which it is necessary to avoid. It is done therefore in one of two ways. It may be picked up with a pair of dissecting forceps, and a small hole carefully made in it, through which a director may be inserted, upon which it may be divided, the back of the knife being turned downwards (Fig. 5) ; or, the small hole having been made in it, the point of one blade of the forceps may be introduced, and the fascia seized and raised slightly from the parts beneath. The side of the knife then being turned downwards, the portion of â– Pig. 5. Division of the fascia on a director. Blunt hooks holding open the wound. fascia raised in the forceps is divided in the direction of the incision in the skin, only the last half-inch of the knife being used. A fresh hold is then taken with the forceps, and another piece of the fascia divided in the same (Fig..6). With a little practice it is easy in this way to make a clean me.u incision through the fascia. It is a much safer plan than that of using a nector, as nothing is divided but that which is raised by the forceps, w ieieas in pushing a director bliudly under a fascia its point may pass leneat i something which it is not intended to cut. Where the tissues are veiy ax beneath the fascia, it is often a convenient plan to guide a probc- poin e bistoury on the forefinger of the left hand, instead of using a director.

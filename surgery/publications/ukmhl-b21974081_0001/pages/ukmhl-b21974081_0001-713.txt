FEMUR—REDUCTION OF THYROID DISLOCATION. 681 Reduction by fraction may be done thus : the Surgeon flexes the limb and abducts it, and then placing his foot upon the side of the pelvis, pulls 01 jerks the thigh in the direction in which the head is required to go to leach the socket. If more force is required a towel may be put round the low ei : part of the thigh. _ Reduction by Extension is to be done in the following manner. The patient is laid on his back ; the counter-extending girth, or towel, is then Fig. 302.—Deduction by Dislocation into Thyroid Foramen by Extension. r placed round the pelvis and fixed firmly to a staple next to the sound side of the patient. A padded girth is then to be placed between the perinmum and | the upper part of the dislocated thigh. From this, extension is made by means of the tourniquet or the pulleys, which are fixed to a staple at a little distance rom the injured side of the patient. Extension having then been made to suci a degiee as to elevate the head of the bone from the depression in which it lies, the Surgeon passes his hand behind the sound leg, and, seizing the an o of the injured limb, presses it backwards and draws it towards the mesial ime, taking care to keep the knee straight, and thus throwing the head of the none into tlm acetabulum by the action of a long lever (Fig. 302), i he following are more rare forms of dislocation downwards.

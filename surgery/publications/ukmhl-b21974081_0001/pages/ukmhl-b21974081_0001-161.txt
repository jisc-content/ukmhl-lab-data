AMPUTATION THROUGH THE CONDYLES. 129 as follows. The finger and thumb of the left hand are placed on the two con- dyloid eminences of the femur, which serve as guides for the starting points of the incision. A long anterior flap is then marked out, well rounded in shape, and reaching as low as the tuberosity of the tibia. This is dissected up either with or without the patella. In cases in which the Surgeon is hesitating between excision and amputation, the joint may be examined before proceeding further and the operation determined on. When the anterior flap has been raised, the knife is passed behind the femur, and a posterior flap, equal in length to the anterior, is cut from within outwards. This flap contains the hamstring tendons, and usually a part of the muscles of the calf, and it conse- quently retracts considerably after being cut. The flaps being held back, the knife is s\\ ept round immediately above the cartilage-covered surfaces, and the saw carried through the bases of the condyles parallel to the articular surface Fig. Amputation through the Condyles by modified circular method.

155 MICROSCOPIC CHANGES IN INFLAMMATION. be finally settled. It was shown by Lister, in 1858, that in the area exposed to the action of an irritant every indication of life is in abeyance during the most acute stage of the resulting inflammation. The muscular coats of the arteries cease to show the irregular contractions seen in health, the pigment-cells in a frog’s foot no longer exhibit their peculiar changes, and the blood flowing through the part behaves as if in contact with dead matter. He thus sums up the conclusions to which his observations led him. “ It appears that the various physical and chemical agents which, when operating powerfully, extinguish the life of the constituents of the animal body, produce by a somewhat gentler action a condition bordering upon loss of vitality, ut quite distinct from it, in which the tissues are, for the time being, in- capacitated for discharging their- wonted offices, though retaining the faculty £retnnm,g afterwards, by virtue of their own inherent powers, to their nrnb'npf 1 ” ° 'viv Prm ided the irritation have not been too severe or protracted.

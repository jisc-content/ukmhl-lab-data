EXCISION OF JOINTS IN GUN-SHOT INJURIES. 347 Baudens states that he saved 13 out of 14 cases of excision of the shoulder. According to Thornton, in the British army in the Crimea, the shoulder was excised 12 times with 2 deaths; the elbow in 17 cases, of which two were fatal ; and partially in five other cases, all of which were successful. These results, which reflect the highest credit on the skill of our Army-Surgeons, were more successful than those that followed amputation of the corresponding parts. Of GO disarticulations at the shoulder, 19, or 31 per cent., were fatal ; and of 153 amputations of the arm, 29, or 19 per cent., died. The result of resection of these joints has not been quite so satisfactory elsewhere : thus, in the Confederate army in America, Chisholm states that up to February, 1804, of 59 cases of excision of the shoulder, 20 proved unsuccessful; and of 45 cases in which the elbow was excised, 9 were unsuccessful.

Of 210 primary excisions of the shoulder-joint death occurred in 50 ; and in 298 secondary excisions 115 cases were fatal, giving a mean mortality of 32G8, against 39‘44 for amputation at the shoulder, and 44'4 for cases treated on the -'pec an p an. In the Uussian army, conservative surgery was also exten- avely practised ; and in it, according to Mouat and Wyatt’s report, of 20 cases 1 excision of the elbow, 15 recovered. sumwv JS?

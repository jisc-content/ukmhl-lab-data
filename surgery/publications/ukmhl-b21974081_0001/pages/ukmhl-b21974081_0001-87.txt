In the thigh and leg it was recommended by Hey to cut the posterior muscles. Pig. 20.—Amputation of Arm fiy the Circular Method. Commencement of first incision. longer than the anterior, to allow for their greater contraction. The edges of the skin were brought together in the transverse diameter of the limb, and a stump was formed with abundant covering for the bones, but necessarily with some puckering and projection at each angle. The three incisions which gained for this operation the name of “ the triple incision ” were first the incision through the skin and fat, secondly, the incision through the muscles, and finally, the circular sweep round the bone to separate the muscles for retraction. The method adopted by Alanson produced much the same result, the only difference being that he attempted to divide the muscles in such a way as to leave a hollow cone with the bone at its apex, by turning the edge of the knife obliquely upwards. This proceeding was found by other Surgeons to be inconvenient, although in Alauson’s hands it produced excellent results. Amputation by the Flap-Method was invented in this country by Lowndham, and was first described in a work by J. Yongc, with the extra- ordinary title of “ Currus Triumphalis e Terebinthino,” published in 167b. The operation urns at first performed only in the leg, and the flap which was, formed from the calf was cut by dissection, and composed chiefly of the integuments and subcutaneous tissues. In ] G!)G Verduin of Amsterdam independently invented a similar operation, but his method differed from that of Lowndham in the flap being cut by transfixion, instead of being raised by dissection. Both Lowndham and Verduin hoped to be able to arrest

THE FLAP-AMPUTATION. 57 During the first forty years of this century, however, tire flap-operation came greatly into favour in this country, and was during the later part of that time supported by the able advocacy of Liston, who invariably amputated by that method, and who certainly did it with wonderful rapidity and precision. Amputation by the double flap as it is still practised, is thus performed (Fig. 22). The two flaps may be made either by cutting from without inwards, or by transfixion—cutting from within outwards. Transfixion is adapted only to fleshy parts, as the thigh or arm ; but cutting from without inwards will be found to afford the best result, and is indeed the only mode of forming the flap, in some situations in which the bones are naturally thinly covered, as on the Fig. 22.

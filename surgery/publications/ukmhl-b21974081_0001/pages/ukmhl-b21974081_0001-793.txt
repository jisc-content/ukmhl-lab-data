THE OPERATION OF TREPHINING. 761 sequences, or for the purpose of removing some cause of compression. The only case in which preventive trephining is practised by modem Surgeons is that of the punctured or starred fracture of the skull, without stupor ; in all other instances in which it is called for, the object of its application is the removal of a cause of compression or of irritation of the brain, such as a de- pressed portion of bone, foreign bodies either fixed in the skull or lying close under it, or pus or blood extravasated within the cranial cavity. The trephine should have a well-tempered crown, serrated half-way up its exterior ; the teeth should be short and broad; the centre-phi must not project more than about one-sixteenth of an inch, and care must be taken that the screw which fixes it is in good working order. The other instruments required are a Key’s saw, an elevator that will not readily snap, a pair of strong dissecting forceps, and a quill cut to a rather long blunt point. The operation itself should be conducted in the following way. The head having been shaved, and the portion of the skull to which the trephine is to be applied having been freely exposed by means of a crucial or T-shaped in- cision, or by the enlargement of any wound that may exist, the periosteum is to be carefully raised with a periosteal elevator from the whole area to be removed. The trephine, with the centre-pin protruded and well screwed uown, is now to be firmly applied until its teeth touch the skull (Fig. 32G) ; f Is then worked with rather a sharp, light, and quick movement, the pressure )emg exercised as the hand is carried from left to right. The centre-pin must >e withdrawn as soon as a good groove is formed by the crown, lest it perforate ne tii’Sfc and illiure the dura inn ter Tn t.l-nc wo-n- flw* / Fig. 326.—Application of Trephine.

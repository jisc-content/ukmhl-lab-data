DISLOCATIONS OF CERVICAL VERTEBRAL 799 (p. 791). In dislocation, where the nerves are not irritated or lacerated in their exit through the spinal column, it is absent. . The Treatment of dislocation of the spine resembles in all important respects that of Fracture of the vertebral column. Reduction has, however, been effected in a sufficient number of cases to justify the attempt being made when the danger is imminent. Dislocation of the Transverse Process of the Cervical Vertebras occasionally occurs. The patient, after a sudden movement, or a tail on the head feels much pain and stiffness in the neck, the head being fixed immovably, and turned to the side opposite to that on which the displacement has occurred. In these cases I have known Reduction effected by the Surgeon placing his knees against the patient’s shoulders, drawing on the head, and then turning it into position, the return being effected with a distinct snap. Wound of the Theca Vertebralis.—-Holmes has recorded two cases in which this accident happened from the stab of a penknife in the lumbar region, one of whom died. The only characteristic sign was the escape of cerebro- spinal fluid in large quantities from the wound.

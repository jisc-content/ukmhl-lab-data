402 ARREST OF ARTERIAL HAEMORRHAGE. Hunter applied the water at a lower temperature 125 1 • to 130 which can -just he endured by the Surgeon’s hands. All these plans act very well, and although the heat is sufficient to whiten the surface of a divided muscle, no evil consequence results, and union by first intention is not interferedjnth If the wound is being treated antiseptically, a hot solution o earbolic acid^ in 40 or two teaspoonfuls of tincture of iodine added to a pint of water, may be ^ instead ofthe simple hot water. Care most be ***?&!£ this method of arresting hemorrhage, that the water used be sufficiently hot, otherwise the effect will be merely to increase the bleeding. , d 3. Styptics are substances which cause contraction of the vessels am coagulate the albumen of the blood, and thus increase the rapidity of for - tion and the firmness of the coagulum. They are used pnncipahy from spongy parts, or in bleeding from cavities or organs to which other ap plications cannot Readily be made. The great objection to their e^en in some wounds is their tendency to modify mjunously the the surface and to prevent union by the first intention. The most useful stVDtics are the solution of perchloride of iron, spirits of turpentine, and ga fflrJTu* appliin of alum, or ct-;cp of the nitrate of silver, is also serviceable. 01 ail these, cue solution of the perchloride of iron, when applied to a bleeding P^cts a the readiest and most efficient haemostatic, coagulatmg the blooc _ before the surface has had time to ge wet m b ““d. ol necessary, be maintained in position j ie p cavity and the actual comparatively ^^^^^succTed " Yet in some cases it is of the most mi- severe measures are likely to succeeu. j- p mgsess • more questionable utility, and ^P®^ proceeds from a soft and particularly m those cases in which the < , urfece 0f which many porous part that will not hold a J^-on ^ ^ J points appear to be hi cedi n hemorrhage will often be staid more sufficient size should be used, and tl e * n = white heat.

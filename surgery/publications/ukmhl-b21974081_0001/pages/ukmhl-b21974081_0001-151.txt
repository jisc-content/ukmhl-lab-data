PIROG OFF’S AMPUTATION AT THE ANKLE. „9 1 m th,S cause- Bufc subsequent and extended experience has astragalus, and the bone cut obliquely downwards and forwards in the line of the incision in the soft parts, so that the saw should come out immediately behind the articulation of the os calcis with the cuboid (Fig. 67) ; the malleoli are then removed, with a thin slice of the tibia, including the whole articular cartilage (Fig. 68). The opposed osseous surfaces must then be accurately adjusted, the movable flap well supported by a broad strip of plaster, and the limb laid on the outer side, with the knee placed so as to take off the tension of the tendo Achilla. The advantages of the long oblique section of the os calcis over the shorter almost vertical cut originally made by Pirogoff are, as Busk has pointed out, that a larger surface of bone is brought into contact fig.

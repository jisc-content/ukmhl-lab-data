FOREIGN BODY IN WINDPIPE—TREATMENT. 817 taneously expelled, varies from a few minutes to many months or years ; in one case, a piece of bone introduced at the age of three, was not ejected until sixty years had elapsed. Tulpius relates a case in which a nut-shell was coughed up after being lodged for seven years ; and Heckster one in which a ducat was thus brought up after a lapse of two years and a half ; the patients, in both instances, recovering. In other cases death may ensue, although the foreign body is coughed up ; thus Sue relates an instance in which a pigeon- bone was spat up seventeen years after its introduction, the patient, however, dying in little more than a year from marasmus. In eight of the cases col- lected by Gross, death followed the spontaneous expulsion. Treatment.—This accident is always very serious, and hence requires prompt and energetic means to be used in order to save the patient ; and for- tunately the means at our disposal, consisting of the simple operation of opening the trachea, and thus facilitating the expulsion of a foreign body, are usually highly successful. Of CO cases in which the result was noted, I found that 37 lived, and 23 died ; but on analysing these cases more closely, it appeared that in 30 no operation was performed ; the expulsion of the foreign body being effected by the efforts of nature. Of these 23 died, and 16 lived. In the remaining 21 cases, tabulated below, tracheotomy was performed ; of these 18 lived, and only three died, showing a remarkable success attendant on this operation. PERIOD OF RETENTION-.

Iracheotomy was done in 98 cases; of these 83 recovered and 15, or 15'30 ner cent., died. ^ Durham collected 271 cases not operated on.

FRACTURES. 54<J Some looms arc much more liable than ollurs to non-union of their fractures. According to the statistics collected by Norris it would appear that the fcrnui the humerus, the bones of the leg, and ot the forearm, and lastly U,c lowu iaw are those in which ununited fractures most frequently occui. Tuns rat of 150 cases, 48 occurred in the femur, 48 in the humerus, ,.3 in the leg, 1J in the forearm and 2 in the lower jaw. This is quite out of proportion to the frequency of fracture in these hones ; for, according to Bruns, of a lac- tures °i8 pencent, occur in the forearm, 15 to 1G in the leg, 7 m the humenxs and 6 in the femur. Hamilton states that m Ins experience the humerus more^commonly the seat of an ununited fracture than the femur; and my CMOnee cans?that may operate in leading to want of union in a feature is the application of a landage directly and too tightly to rlnno the vascular supply to the broken hone is strangled, the muscles ana sort quantity for consolidation of the fiacture. .

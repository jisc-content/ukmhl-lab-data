654 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. elbow with his right hand, and, steadying the acromion with his left, draws - the limb well away from the body and then depresses it across the knee : the head of the bone is thus reduced. 3. Another mode of reduction which will be found to succeed in almost all cases of subglenoid and subcoracoid dislocation is to place the patient upon a low chair or couch, and to raise the avm perjiendicularly by the side of the head, at the same time fixing the acromion and making gentle traction upwards. The Surgeon should stand behind the patient, and in many cases so little force is required, that he can take the arm in one hand and steady the acromion with the other. Should more force be necessary, an assistant may steady the shoulder, or the Surgeon may use his foot (Fig. 277). When the bone is felt TTT h i f, i —— JU .11 L IL Fig. 277.

4io ARREST OF ARTERIAL HAEMORRHAGE. amputation, the mouth of the artery must lie seized and drawn forwards (lug. 142). For this purpose a tenaculum, or sharp hook, was formerly used, and answered the purpose very well. There are, however, some objections to this instrument; thus, it occasionally seizes other tissues with the artery, and, as it draws the vessel forwards by perforating its coats, it has happened that, an accidental puncture having been made by it behind the part to which the ligature is applied, ulceration of the vessel and subsequent fatal haemorrhage Fig. 142.

The most convenient instrument for the purpose of drawing forward the artery, and one to which no objection whatever applies, is Liston’s “ bull-dog " forceps. These have been conveni- ently modified by having the blades expanded just above the points (b ig. 143), so that the ligature can be slipped over their end on to an artery that is deep y seated, as between bones or close to the interosseous membrane of the leg-* situation in which it is sometimes troublesome to tie a vessel by any other m In applying the ligature, care must be taken that it be put well over the cut end of the artery, that it clear the points of the forceps, and that i >e tied tightly in a' knot, which does not slip (Fig. 144). As the knot is tightened, the tips of the forefingers should be in close contact vit i ie ■points of the forceps, and be pressed slightly downwards on the artery, o 101 * Sthe vessel may‘ bo dragged forwards out of its bed, or Jh.fep.PjW off it In some cases the bleeding point may be so situated, that the ligature if most conveniently passed under and round it by means of an ordinary curved needle.

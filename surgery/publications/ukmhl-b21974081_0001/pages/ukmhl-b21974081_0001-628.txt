59^ SPECIAL FRACTURES. this inj ary is undoubtedly true. In the more severe crushes of the trochanter, the anterior wall of the neck as well as the posterior may be driven amongst the splintered fragments. The Treatment of the extracapsular fracture may very conveniently and efficiently be conducted by means of the long splint, a padded belt, if necessary, being strapped firmly round the hips underneath it ; or the plan recommended by Sir A. Cooper, of placing the patient on a double inclined plane, with both feet and ankles tied together, and a broad belt, well-padded, firmly strapped round the body, so as to press the fragments of the trochanter firmly against one another, will be found an excellent mode of keeping the limb of a proper length, and the fragments in contact. In impacted extracapsular fracture nothing can be done to diminish the deformity. Solid bony union always takes place, even in aged subjects. The patient remains throughout life more or less crippled, chiefly by the eversion, the amount of shortening being of little consequence. The patient may have a Thomas’s splint applied after resting in bed till the swelling and pain have subsided ; or a leather splint may be applied at the end of the third week, and he may’be allowed to move about on crutches.

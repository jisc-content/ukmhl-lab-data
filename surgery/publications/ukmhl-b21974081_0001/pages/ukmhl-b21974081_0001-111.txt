EFFECTS OF ANTISEPTIC TREATMENT. 7 cannot be attributed solely to the use of antiseptics, however 79 _ ibcse figures need no comment. They prove that antiseptics are antago- nistic to pyaemia, and the consequent value of a rigid antiseptic treatment in the circumstances in which the amputations tabulated by Schede were performed. But, truly, it is much to be regretted that it should be necessary to go to German sources to form an estimate of the value of the antiseptic treatment in amputations, and that we do not as yet possess any sufficient record of the practice of British Surgeons to guide us in this respect. Ihat the amputation-mortality in this country has materially diminished timing the last twenty years is undoubted. The following table, uublished by Sir James Paget, proves this. In it is compared the amputation-mortality at St. Bartholomew’s during two periods of four years each, at ten years’ interval. ! Primary. Secondary. Fur Disease. CASES. DIED. PER CENT. CASES. DIED.

They have been dealt with on the same principle as those of Schede, but from want of sufficient detail it is not possible to separate them into those treated antiseptically and those treated bv be older methods, or by modified forms of antiseptic dressing.

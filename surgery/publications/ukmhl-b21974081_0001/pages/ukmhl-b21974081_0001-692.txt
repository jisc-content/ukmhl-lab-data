66o SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. 2. Ulna. The only dislocation to which the ulna alone is subject is that in a direction Backwards. Although this displacement may occur in an uncom- . plicated form, it is more frequently associated with more or less dislocation of the head of the radius. When it occurs, it may be recognized by the projec- tion of the olecranon backwards, and by the head ol the ladius being felt in its normal situation, or nearly so, during the movements of pronation and supination. In some extremely rare cases the coronoid process is fractured at the same time, causing ready disappearance and recurrence of the dislocation, with crepitus. 3. Radius.—The radius alone may be dislocated forwards, backwards, or outwards. The dislocation Forwards is by far the most common. In the many instances of it that I have seen, it has resulted from a fall on the palm Fig. 27S.—Dislocation of tlie Baclius forwards : Limit of Power of Bending the Arm.

The signs of this displacement arc the following. 1 he toi arm is slightly flexed, and in a mid state between pronation and supination, •my attempt at completing the latter position occasions great pain, as does the endeavour to straighten the arm.

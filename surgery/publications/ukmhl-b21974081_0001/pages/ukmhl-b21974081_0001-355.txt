PUNCTURED WOUNDS AND THEIR TREATMENT. 323 extent, from the prick of a needle in the finger to a sword-thrust through the body. Not unfrequently punctured wounds are somewhat contused, being made by a triangular or wedge-like weapon, as a bayonet or lance-blade. I 'When deep, they are of a most dangerous character—wounding blood-vessels, traversing the great cavities, and injuring the contained viscera. A punctured wound is extremely difficult to drain, the external orifice being very small in proportion to the area of the surface. Thus, if a narrow weapon half an inch in width were thrust into the thigh for a depth of six inches, the area of the r two surfaces of the wound would be six square inches, while the external open- iing would be only half an inch in length. The small external opening is easily choked by a clot of blood, and is frequently injudiciously closed by the Surgeon. The whole track becomes distended with the blood or the serous exudation from the injured surfaces, and unless proper means are taken to prevent it, decomposition sets in, followed by inflammation and suppuration extending deeply into the injured part. In consequence of this, combined with the insufficient exit for the discharges, the pus may burrow deeply, large collec- tions of septic matter may form, and severe constitutional disturbance is the necessary result. Treatment.—In the treatment of punctured wounds, the principal points 1 are to arrest the haemorrhage, and to facilitate union. The haemorrhage must be arrested by pressure properly applied by means of compresses or pads, so as to approximate the sides of the puncture ; by the [ application of cold ; or by cutting down on the injured vessel if it be a large one, and ligaturing above and below the perforation in it. In the majority of cases of severe punctured wounds suppuration and union by second intention will take place in consequence of the great difficulty in drainage. In order to obtain early union, the cavity should be washed out with carbolic-acid-lotion (1 in 40) or some other antiseptic, by means of an india-rubber tube on the end of a syringe. Care must be taken that there is plenty of room for the fluid injected to flow out rapidly, otherwise the spaces of the areolar tissue will become widely distended with the antiseptic solution ; all superfluous lotion is then squeezed out, and a drainage tube inserted deeply into the wound. This may be shortened considerably after twenty-four hours, and gradually diminished day by day till it can be safely removed. The exteinal application should be one of the forms of absorbent antiseptic dressing. On no account should a punctured wound be closed by collodion or any other occlusive application. The smallness of the external opening is apt to make the Surgeon forget the real extent of the injury. As the tube is s oitened, the coalescence of the sides of the wound may be encouraged by PI°per!y appKed compresses and bandages. The deep inflammation that so otten follows these wounds is due solely to insufficient drainage and decompo- sition extending into the wound, and no treatment but the prevention of these conditions will exclude it.

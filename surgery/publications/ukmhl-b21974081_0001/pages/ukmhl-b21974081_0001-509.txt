If only a single group of muscles is paralysed, properly designed apparatus may be required to overcome the deformity which ensues, but this should never be used if it can be avoided, as it interferes to some extent with the use of the limb.

In gun-shot-wounds, in which the nerves are often contused and partially divided and in which the wound almost always heals with suppuration, it is more common. Pathology.—The disease consists essentially of a chronic inflammation slowly ascending the nerve, with thickening of the neurilemma and over- growth of the interfascicular areolar tissue.

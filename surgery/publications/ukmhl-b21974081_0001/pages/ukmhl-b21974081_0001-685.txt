REDUCTION OF DISLOCATIONS OF TIIE HUMERUS. 653 cient procedure iu ordinary cases. In adopting this plan, the patient is laid upon his back upon a low bed or couch, or even on the ground ; the Surgeon, Fig. 275.—Reduction of a Dislocated Shoulder-joint by the Heel in the Axilla. ■ seating himself upon the edge of this on the same side as the dislocated arm, takes the limb by the wrist, and, fixing one foot firmly upon the ground, places the other, covered merely with the stocking, well up into the axilla, so that the heel may jiress against the lower border of the scapula, and the footact rqxmthe humerus(Fig. 275). He then draws the limb steadily downwards, and, when it is disengaged to a sufficient extent, brings the hand across the front of the patient, the foot acting as a fulcrum, by which the head of the bone may be reduced by being pushed upwards and out- wards. This mode of reduction is especially serviceable in ordinary dislocations into the axilla, and iu those under the clavicle. In the latter, however, it will be necessary to draw the arm more obliquely downwards and backwards, and to press the foot some- what forwards rqron the head of the bone, after it has been disengaged by being- brought below the coracoid process. 2. The reduction bj the knee in the axilla (Fig. 2, 6) is precisely the same in principle as the last, though not by any means so good a plan, the knee being too large, and not following the movements of the humerus so readily as the foot.

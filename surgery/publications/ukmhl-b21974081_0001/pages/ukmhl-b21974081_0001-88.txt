56 AMPUTATIONS. haemorrhage by pressing the flap against tlie ends of the bones and securing it by bandages. The result was, that although in a few cases, especially in the hands of Yonge, who understood the necessity of drainage, union by first intention seems to have taken place, in the great majority the discharges were pent up and caused violent inflammation. In consequence of the unsatisfactory nature of the results obtained, the method was completely abandoned till 1731), when it was re-introduced by a French surgeon of the name of Ravaton, who modified the operation by making two rectangular flaps, one from each side of the limb, and securing the vessels by means of the ligature. A similar operation was performed by Vermale, of Mannheim, in 1707, in the lower part of the thigh. That the flap method still did not yield very favourable results, on account of the tendency to accumulation of discharges between the flaps in the absence of any proper system of drainage, is evident from the fact that in 1 < 65, OTIalloran, “surgeon and man-midwife ” at Limerick, recommended that the flap and stump should be dressed as separate sores, and that they should not be brought together till the surfaces were covered by granulations. This plan did not, however, find much favour, and at the end of the last century Surgeons preferred the circular amputation in most cases, the flap operation being restricted almost entirely to the upper part of the leg, the lower part of the thigh, and the distal parts of the foot. Alauson and Hcj, uhose names have already been mentioned in connection with the circular method of amputation, practised and improved the flap operation in these situations.

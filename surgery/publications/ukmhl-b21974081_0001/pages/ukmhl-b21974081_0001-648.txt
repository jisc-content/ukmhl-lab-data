That the aperture corresponding to the heel he closed by a tew turns of a roller in ■which the heel may rest firmly, but with a certain amount of yielding pressure ; Fig. 253.—Sl’Intyre’s Splint, modified by Liston. 3. That the foot be covered with a flannel sock, from the heel of which a tape passes, by which the foot can be slung up to the foot piece ; and, 4. That the lower end of the splint be raised and steadied on a wooden block. In some cases of fracture of the bones of the leg, however, MTntyre’s apparatus Pig. 254.—Salter’s Swing-cradle for Fractured Leg. is not applicable. This is more particularly the case when the fracture is very oblique, from above downwards, and from before backwards ; in those circumstances, the fragments cannot be brought into good position so long as the limb is kept extended and resting on its posterior surface ; the bones riding considerably, and one or other of the fractured ends often pressing upon the skm in such a way as to threaten ulceration. In these cases it is, that division, of the tendo Achillis has been recommended, with a view of removing tie influence of muscular contraction. This appears to me, however, to >c an unnecessarily severe procedure, and certainly was not very successful in some

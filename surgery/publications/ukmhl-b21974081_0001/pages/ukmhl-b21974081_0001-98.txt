AMPUTATIONS. 66 middle one of which is passed between the bones. Retractors are ot use only in circular or combined flap and circular amputations. In the pure nap operations they are unnecessary for retraction of the soft parts, but they are still of use in protecting the muscles from the teeth of the saw and m keeping the surfaces free from the bone-dust: for the laceration of the deep muscles >y the saw and the imbedding of bone-dust in their substance, interfere serious y with union. If a retractor is used, the final clearing of the bone is completed after it has been applied. This is best done, when there is only a single bone bv a firm circular sweep of the knife from heel to point roundl the rn der segment of the bone, and then another round the upper surface in the opposite direction. If there be two bones, care must be taken m clearing t lem no direct the edge of the knife upwards into the the line to which the saw is to be applied, lest any aiteiy ic will, on account of its retraction, be difficult to secure it. , . n ■ The bone having been properly cleared, the flaps mus e im y > order to allow the saw to be applied opposite the higlies pom . through the soft parts.

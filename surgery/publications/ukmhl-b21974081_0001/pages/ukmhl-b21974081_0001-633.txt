j i\ ill TREATMENT OF FRACTURES OF SHAFT OF FEMUR. 601 diminution in the length of the limb is in reality of no consequence, and gives rise to no inequality of gait ; the pelvis, by the obliquity it assumes, remedying this. It is only when the shortening exceeds half or three quarters of an inch, that it is important and occasions deformity. The rotation outwards of the lower fragment, however, if not corrected by treatment, seriously cripples the patient, as it leaves the toes and the patella directed outwards, so that the movements of both the knee aud the ankle are rendered useless m walking. . .. . 1. The fracture may be treated by simply relaxing the muscles ol the limb. This is effected by laying it upon its outer side, flexing the thigh to nearly a right angle with the body, and the leg upon the thigh, and supporting the limb in "this position by an angular wooden or leather splint, extending from the hip to the knee or outer ankle, and by a short inside thigh splint. This position I have occasionally adopted in fractures about a couple of inches below the trochanters, in which there is a great tendency to the projection outwards of the lower end of the upper fragment, and have found these cases turn out better in this way than on any other plan of treatment. 2. Extension, without regard to muscular relaxation, by means of Liston’s Fig. 232.—Liston’s Long SjJlint. or Desault’s long splint and perineal band (Fig. 232), will be found a most successful plan of treating fractures in the middle and lower parts of the thigh. Iu employing the loug splint for the treatment of these fractures, care must e a veil that it be of sufficient length to extend about six inches below the so e, and nearly as high as the axilla. The perineal band should consist of a so land kerchief covered with oiled silk, and must be gradually tightened. \ciy ingenious appliance has been contrived by my former House-Surgeon, Fig. 233.—Browne’s Elastic Catch.

FRACTURES. 5i6 During the application of this apparatus, extension must he kept up by an assistant, so as to hold the fracture in position ; and, until the starch is ' thoroughly dried, which usually takes from thirty to fifty hours, a wooden splint may, if necessary, be applied to the limb, so as to keep it to its proper length and shape. The drying of the starch may be hastened by the applica- tion of hot bottles to the apparatus. After the bandages have become quite dry, the patient may be allowed to move about on crutches, taking care, of course, to keep the injured limb well slung up, and not to bear upon it, or to jar it against the ground (Fig. 179). In the course of about three or four days after its application, the apparatus will usually be found to have loosened somewhat, the limb appearing to shrink within it. In these circumstances, it becomes necessary to cut it up with a pair of Seutin’s pliers, such as are repre- sented in Fig. 176, or a pair of French vine-dresser’s scissors which are perhaps more durable. This section must be made up the front of the limb, care being Fig. 178.— Starched Bandage: Trap left for Dressing Wound. .—Starched Bandage applied to Fractured Thigh. taken not to injure the skin in so doing. If the fracture is so far consolidated that the limb can be handled without fear of displacing the .fragments, the splint may be completely removed, and its edges pared, about three-quarters of an inch being taken from each. The cotton-wool is then cleaned out from its inside, a fresh layer is wrapped round the limb, and the apparatus re-appliec by means of an unstarched roller or tapes. If the fracture be too recent to allow of this, the edges must be pared without removing the splint from the limb, and changing the cotton-wool must be deferred to a later period. If the

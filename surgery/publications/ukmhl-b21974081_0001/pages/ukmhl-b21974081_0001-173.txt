RESULTS OF IIIP-JOINT AMPUTATIONS. 141 in which J. Roux practised it in the French campaign of 1859 in Italy ah recovered, as did two out of nine in which it was practised in America. Re-amputation'at the hip-joint for diseased thigh-stumps has also been a successful operation : 4 out of 7 American cases recovered. Amputation at the hip-joint for disease of the femur has undoubtedly become less fatal of late years than formerly. This is owing- to the operation being submitted to at an earlier stage of the disease; to a better selection of cases; possibly to improved methods of after-treatment; but mainly to the influence of anaesthetics, by which the shock to the system necessarily resulting from so very severe a mutilation is materially lessened. The employment of Pancoast’s aorta-compressor and the elastic band will probably still further reduce the mortality by lessening the loss of blood. The more extended statistics lately published by Max Schede show the following results :—Amputations in civil practice,—for injury, 55 cases, with, 39 deaths, or 70,9Q per cent. ; for disease, 153 cases, 65 deaths, or 42'68 per cent. The carefully collected statistics of Liming of amputations for gunshot wounds show the following results : primary amputations—90 cases, 84 deaths, or 93'33 per cent. ; intermediate amputations (from second to fourth day)—-22 cases, 21 deaths, or 95'45 per cent. ; secondary or late amputations—53 cases, 42 deaths, or 79-24 per cent. ; amputations in which the date' is not stated— 65 cases, 60 deaths, or 92-30 per cent.

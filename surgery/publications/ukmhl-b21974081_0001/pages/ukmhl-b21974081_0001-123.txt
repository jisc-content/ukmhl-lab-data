AMPUTATION AT METACARPO-PHALANGEAL JOINT. 9r ligament on the stretch. Finally, the phalanx is removed by carrying the knife through the joint, no flap being made from the dorsal aspect (Fig. 32).* In doing this, care must be taken to avoid cutting too high up, and so mis- taking the depression above the head of the second phalanx for the articu- lation. Amputation is performed between the proximal and second phalanges in the same way ; but as a stump composed of the first phalanx is of but little use, it is more common to remove the whole finger. In the hand of a working man, howeiei, it is peihaps better to save even one phalanx, as it helps some- what to strengthen the grasp ; for the stump can be strongly flexed, partly by the action of the interossei and partly by the long flexors which form new attachments at its extremity. In the case of the index finger, it will be better always to leave the proximal phalanx, the stump of which forms a useful opponent to the thumb.

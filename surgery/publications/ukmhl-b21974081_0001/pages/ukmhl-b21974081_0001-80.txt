It is better, therefore, whenever .possible, to use the instrument known as Pancoast’s or Lister’s Aortic Tourniquet (Fig. 17). This consists merely of a large horse- shoe clamp, one end of which is ex- panded and padded so as to fit the spine, and the other receives a screw which presses down a pad of sufficient size to compress the aorta with cer- tainty.

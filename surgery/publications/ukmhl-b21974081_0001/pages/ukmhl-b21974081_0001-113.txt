81 INJURY AND DISEASE. after amputation of the fore-arm was 45 ; of the arm, 55 ; of the shoulder- joint, 61 ; of the foot, 76 ; of the leg, 72 ; of the knee-joint, 91 ; of the thigh, 92 ; and of the hip, 100. fn the Italian campaign of 1859, the percentages of the mortality in the French army—including in some cases .operations on wounded Austrians—were : fore-arm, 42 ; arm. 56 ; shoulder- joint, 55 ; foot, 55 ; leg, 70 ; knee-joint, 75 ; thigh, 78 ; hip-joint, 57. In the war of the American rebellion the percentages of mortality were as follows showing markedly how rapidly it runs up in accordance with the size of the Part removed : fingers and hand, 1/6 ; wrist, 5'5 ; fore-arm, 16‘5 ; arm 21/2 • shoulder, 39'2 ; partial of foot, 9'2 ; ankle-joint, 13‘4 ; le°- ?6 • knee 55 • thigh, 64-4 ; hip, 85’7. Xot °nI7 is thci'e fchis increase in the rate of mortality as the operation approaches the trunk, but in the larger limbs, more especially in the thigh every additional inch that is removed appears to make a difference in this respect. _ Thus, m our army in the Crimea, of 178 amputations of the thio-h 44 were in the upper third, and of these 38, or 86 per cent., proved fatal • *68 iveie m the middle third, and of these 41, or 60 per cent, died ; whilst in the lower third the mortality out of 66 cases was 37, or 56 percent. Inthe fiench army m the Crimea, according to Chenu, of 81 amputations of the fWnrfll ^1 fchU’d’ 37, 01 00 per ccnfc-’ died>- iu 91 amputations at the rniddJe third, there were 63 deaths, or 69 per cent. ; and in the lower d fclleie were 101 cases, with 59 deaths, or 58'4 per cent. In the Italian campaign of 1859, according to the same authority, there were 46 cases of amputation of the thigh at the upper third, with 43 deaths, or 93 per cent iohe h'S S i “ m”taHt7 °f 44’ or 84 per cent- - 43 the iovei thud, with 36 deaths, or 83 per cent.

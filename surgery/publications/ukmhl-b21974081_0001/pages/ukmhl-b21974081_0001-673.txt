If the dislocation be left unreduced, the patient slowly regains some power of movement over the jaw ; he gradually approximates the lips, and, after a length of time, may even be enabled to bring the lines of teeth into apposition, especially posteriorly. In the Unilateral dislocation, where one condyle only is displaced, the axis of the lower jaw is directed towards the side opposite to that on which the dis- placement exists ; and the general signs are the same, but in a less marked degree, as those which are met with when both sides are dislocated. The hollow before the meatus on the injured side is, however, well marked, and serves to point out the seat and nature of the displacement, the diagnosis of which is not always readily made ; indeed, E. W. Smith states that he has seen attempts at reduction applied to the uninjured side. Sir A. Cooper has described a Subluxation of the jaw, most frequently met with in young and delicate women, in which, in consequence of the relaxation of the ligaments, the head of the bone appears to slip forwards upon the eminentia articularis, whenever the mouth is opened at all widely, as in gaping, laughing, &c. It may usually be ascertained by telling the patient to put out the tongue. The bone hitches, as it were, and prevents the mouth from being shut at once. Most commonly, the natural efforts of the patient are sufficient to return the head of the bone into the glenoid cavity with a cracking noise or even a loud snap. The Reduction of a dislocated jaw is easily effected ; it being necessary only Fig. 264.—Reduction of Dislocated Jaw. to push the angle of the bone downwards and backwards, and at the same time to raise the chin; by so doing the attachment of the temporal muscle to the coronoid process acts as a fulcrum, aud the condyle is brought slightly downwards so as to be disengaged from the articular eminence, when the external pterygoid muscles will at once draw it into its proper position. The reduction is best effected by the Surgeon, standing before the patient, placing thumbs> wel1 protected by a thick napkin, or a few turns of a narrow • kie molai teeth on each side, and then depressing the angle of the ‘snvonT^1C same ^me that he raises the chin by means of his fingers intoh/’f and Placed underneath it (Pig. 264).

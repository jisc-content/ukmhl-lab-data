576 SPECIAL FRACTURES. excision great care must be taken to save tbc periosteum as much as possible, otherwise'a flail-like joint may result. In secondary operations, as the perios- , teum is loosened by the inflammation, it usually is saved without difficulty. Fractures or the Fore-arm.—1. The only fracture of the bones of the fore-arm that commonly occurs in the vicinity of the elbow-joint, is that of the Olecranon ; this happens almost invariably from falls upon the elbow, and hence is usually accompanied by very considerable bruising and swelling of the parts. It may possibly, though very rarely, occur from muscular action. The displacement is usually considerable, the de- tached fragment being drawn upwards by the triceps muscle. Occasionally, however, when the ligamentous expansion of the tendon of this muscle is not torn through, there is but little separation of the fragments. In the majority of cases, as the injury takes place from direct violence, there is much swelling about the joint ; and not un- frequently the fracture is comminuted or com- pound. The Treatment is best conducted by moderately straightening the arm, and maintaining it in that position by means of a well-padded light wooden splint kid along its fore part. But, although the arm should be kept nearly straight it should not be quite extended. The best and most easy position m which to put it up is that into which the arm naturally falls when hanging■ ij the side • in this there will he seen to be slight flexion at the elbow (F 0. - )• If the fore-arm be too rigidly extended on the arm, it may be canned backwards Fig. 200.—Fracture of Olecranon.

METATARSAL BONES. 625 fall. It was in the case of a man who fell clown the shaft of a lift at an hotel, about GO feet deep, receiving injuries to the chest and spine that eventually killed him. He appeared to have alighted, in the first instance, on the right foot, the os calcis of which was extensively fractured, and the scaphoid broken across without displacement, the astragalus being uninjured. In all cases of fracture of the tarsal bones, whether simple or compound, with so much displacement as to render reduction difficult and its mainten- ance impossible, the best course to be pursued is that of cutting down upon and removing the displaced fragment. I know not what else can be done. Fracture of the Metatarsal Bones usually occurs from direct violence as by the passage of the wheel of a cart or railway-carriage over the foot, and is then attended with so much laceration and bruising of the soft parts as not unfrequently to render amputation necessary. I have in one instance known the three outer metatarsal bones broken by a person jumping from a height. But most commonly their elasticity saves them, and the ankle-joint gives way in such an accident. There is but little, if any, displacement in these cases ; and unless the soft parts be so damaged as to require amputation, the support of a starched or plaster bandage is usually all the treatment that is necessary. s s vor,. x.

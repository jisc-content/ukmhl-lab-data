369 LOCAL AND INFECTIVE VARIETIES. our profession. In other cases, again, infection appears to have taken place by absorption under the semilunar fold of skin at the base of the nail. That the poisonous influence from the bodies of persons who have died of septic diseases is transmissible to others by contact or infection, cannot be denied ; and accoucheurs and operating Surgeons should abstain as carefully as possible from performing post mortem examinations on patients dying from such diseases, lest the poison be carried to and excite similar morbid processes in their own patients. Much of the septic disease that used formerly to prevail in hospitals was engendered in this way, and infective disease has often thus been carried out of hospitals and communicated to private patients by Surgeons neglectiug hygienic precautions. Symptoms.—From what has been stated above, it would appear that there are two distinct kinds of mischief resulting from dissection-wounds. First, the purely local form, proceeding from the irritation of putrid matter acting on the unbroken skin, or on a scratch or wound, and, secondly, the true infective form, spreading widely from the point of inoculation. Of the purely local affections, the most common is the small pustule so often met with in the dissecting room. About twelve to twenty-four hours after inoculation the punctured part becomes painful, hot, and throbbing; at the end of about forty-eight hours a small drop of pus is seen raising the cuticle. If this be punctured, a small superficial sore is seen beneath, and the pain is at once relieved.

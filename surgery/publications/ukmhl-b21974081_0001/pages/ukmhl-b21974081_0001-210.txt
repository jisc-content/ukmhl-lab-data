I7S LOCAL DISTURBANCES AND INFLAMMATION. to the part affected, but radiates extensively along the course of nerves, of which the terminal branches are implicated, perhaps, only to a limited extent. Thus, in inflammation of the testis there is pain m the loins and groins. In deep-seated ophthalmitis there may bo cxcpiisite pain along the branches of the fifth nerve over the whole side of the head or face, in consequence of the ciliary branches of the nasal, which are distributed to the ins an choroid, becoming compressed or stretched. 4. The Temperature of an external part of the body when inflamed lines above its normal standard, but not above that of the blood m the left ventnc e. In inflammation of internal organs, the temperature rises only as the general heat of the body is elevated by the inflammatory fever. John Hunter orifinally pointed out this fact; he found, m a case of hydrocele, that a thermometer inserted into the tunica vaginalis stood at 92 1 bcfoie inflam- mation had been excited in the sac, and at 98'75° F. after it had bee^ The conclusion to be drawn from these facts is, that the increase _• * 1 ■ in inflammation, when it occurs, is due to the flow of a larger quantity ot blood through the part and not to a development of heat m the part itself, depone on ^^edtLe-chaBge.

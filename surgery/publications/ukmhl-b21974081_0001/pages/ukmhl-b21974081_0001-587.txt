555 FRACTURE OF THE LOWER JAW. where a tooth was overlooked in this position, no union ol the 11 net me took place till it had been removed. Wien depression, especially neai the symphysis, is considerable, a clamp apparatus which fixes the chin and line of teeth, invented by Lonsdale, answers the purpose ol steadying the fiag- Fig. 191.

When the fracture is double, one fissure occurring near the symphysis, the other near the angle, there is often very considerable difficulty in bringing the fragments into anything like good position, without the aid of some special ap- paratus. In such cases a cast should be taken of the teeth in gutta-percha, while the frag- ments are held in accurate position, and from this a metal plate should be modelled, fitted to the teeth, and attached to Lonsdale’s clamp or to a stem, and fixed to a horse - shoe- shaped splint placed under the jaw, so as to keep the whole steady and solid. Union gene- rally takes place readily and very perfectly in fractures of the jaw, though it is some- what slow at first, and the fragments continue mobile for some weeks. But the vascular supply of the bone is abundant, and re- parative action correspondingly perfect. i® °^en delayed by the separation of necrosed fragments.

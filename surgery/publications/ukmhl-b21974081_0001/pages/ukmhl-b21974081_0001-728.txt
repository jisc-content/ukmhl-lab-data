SPECIAL DISLOCA TIONS. 6p6 violently bent and twisted, and all the tarsal joints more or less torn open, so as to necessitate amputation. Dislocation of the Metatabsal Bones, though excessively rare, from the manner in which these bones are locked into the tarsus, and retained by short and strong ligaments, yet occasionally occurs. Instances are recorded by Dupuytren and Smith : Liston mentions a case of luxation of the metatarsal bone of the great toe from direct violence ; and Tufnell records a case of luxation downwards and backwards of the inner three metatarsal bones, from a fall upon the leg by a horse rolling on its rider. Two cases have occurred in my practice, in one of which, by the pressure of a “ turn-table ” on a rail- way, the outer three metatarsal bones were dislocated downwards. In the other, in consequence of a horse falling and rolling on its rider, there were a compound dislocation of the first and a simple dislocation of the fourth meta- tarsal bone. The question of amputation will always present itself in these cases, and must be determined on general principles, by the age of the patient, and the extent of injury to the soft parts. Luxations of the Phalanges of the Toes but rarely happen, and present nothing special in nature or treatment.

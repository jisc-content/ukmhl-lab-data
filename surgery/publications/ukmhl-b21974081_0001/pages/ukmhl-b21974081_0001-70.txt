GENERAL REMARKS ON OPERATIONS. 33 as the widest part of the blade, and there should be no constriction where it joins the handle. When very free and extensive incisions are required, as in the removal of large tumours, &c., a Listons spring-backed bistouij, of proper size and shape, is a very convenient instrument (Fig. 2). For a sub- cutaneous incision, a very small narrow-bladed knife is required. The ordinary scalpel is held in two ways : first, like a pen (Fig. 3) ; secondly, like a dinner-knife (Fig. 4). The former position is that universally adopted in dissecting the dead body, and the habit of always holding the knife in this wav is one of the first faults which a student commencing operative surgery has to correct In dissection, also, the student habitually turns his knife from the deep parts towards the skin, so that any slip of the knife may not injure the subcutaneous structures which it is his object to preserve In raising flaps in the livino- body, the reverse must be the rule, as, if the skin and subcutaneous tissues are scored by the knife, the flap will certainly slough, ho one who has Fig. 4.—Scalpel lield like a dinner-knife. not hif lit operative surgery could conceive how difficult it is to correct this SXUit in young operators. In making an without inwards, as in the removal of a tumour, or in cutting.down upon an orterv in its continuity, the skin must be pnt gently on the soicteh, and tick entered perpendicularly to its surface, so as fairly to penetrate the sub^u‘“"e“ fat the handle may then be lowered, so that the incision is continued with the MlV of the taife. This may ho done by drawing the knife steadily along, if £: si

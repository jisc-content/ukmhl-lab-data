415 effects of ligature in continuity. After the ligature lias been passed, its two ends should be held firmly in one hand and the fore-finger of the other hand pressed down into the loop, while an assistant feels the pulsation of some branch below, or of the tumour in the case of an aneurism. If the pulsation is arrested by the pressure of the finger iu the loop of the ligature, the operator is sure that he has got the artery, and he may tie the knot. The ends of the ligature are then cut off close or left hanging out of the wound, according to the material of which it is composed. In ligaturing an artery in its continuity the injured portion is necessarily exposed to the longitudinal strain due to the elasticity of the artery. On the other hand, when the vessel is completely divided and each end tied separately this source of disturbance is removed. It has been frequently suggested that it would be safer in all cases to apply two ligatures and to divide the artery between them. This practice has had many advocates, the chief of whom in this country was Abernethy ; but it never came into general use. It has, however, lately been revived by Walsham in St. Bartholomew’s hospital, and possibly it may be of service in those parts of the body in which it is not easy by position to relax the vessel and keep it at perfect rest after it is tied.

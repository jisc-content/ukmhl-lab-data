SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. 11 2 articulation is performed without further difficulty. This operation is seldom practised, disease being rarely limited to the metatarsal hones, hut usually implicating the joints as well. Their dis- articulation from the tarsus is, moreover, very troublesome, on account of the irregu- larity of the line of articulation ; hence io is better to saw through the metatarsus just in front of the tarsal articulations, than to attempt to disjoint the bones. A combination of these two procedures may sometimes be advantageously adopted. In several of those severe crushes of the anterior part of the foot, that are not un- frecjuently the result of tram-car 01 1 ail- way injury, and in which the bones and soft parts are irregularly crushed and torn, I have made a very excellent stump by dis- articulating the first and the fifth meta- tarsal bones, and sawing across the three middle ones almost an inch anterior to their articulations with the tarsus, or by simply dissecting back the sole of the foot, clearing the bones, and sawing them across at a convenient line. Amputation through, the Tarsus may conveniently be performed by Cho- 50.-A. Line of Incision for Ampu- a' tation of Great Toe and Metatarsal Bone. B. Line for Chopart s Ampu- tation. C.

43 THE ELASTIC TOURNIQUET. very forcibly stretched and applied round the shoulder, the lower part of the turn being high in the axilla, so as to compress the artery against the neck of the scapula and the upper part, as far as possible, internal to the end of the clavicle, and the acromion process. To prevent its slipping inwards, a piece of bandage should be put beneath it both in front and behind at the time it is applied, by means of which an assistant may hold it in position (Fig. 7). In operating upon the upper part of the thigh, the india-rubber tube must be of sufficient length to go round the limb and the pelvis. The middle of the tube is to be applied to the front of the thigh immediately below the groin; the two ends are then to be carried forcibly round and brought up to the front again, the groin in the'line of the limb, and a similar piece behind, over which the tube is to be applied, so that by pulling on the ends of the bandage any slipping of the band may be prevented during the operation. The middle of the tube is to be placed in the peri- meiun, and the ends pulled forcibly outwards and crossed as high above the tiochanter as possible, and afterwards carried round the pelvis immedi- ately below the crest of the ilium (Fig. 9). If the bandage is applied with sufficient force, it is quite unnecessary to put any pad over the artery. In the accompanying figure the patient is lying on his side with the right thigh flexed, in the position for an oval amputation at the hip joint. In operations upon the penis or scrotum, a piece of bandage should be laid along the some behind and where they cross and are after- wards passed round the pelvis immediately below the crest of the ilium. In amputation at the hip- joint, a long piece of bandage must be laid upon the middle of Fig. 8.—Esmarch’s Tourniquet to Thigh. Fig. 10.—Esmarch’s Band applied for Operations ou the Penis or Scrotum.

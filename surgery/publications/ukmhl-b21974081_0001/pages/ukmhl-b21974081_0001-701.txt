669 COCCYX—FEMUR. The Coccyx is sometimes violently bent, and almost dislocated forwards by falls • or it may be forcibly bent backwards during violent parturient efforts. These accidents may be remedied by manipulation through the rectum ; but arc apt to be followed by that painful neuralgic affection Coccydyma, described at Dislocations of the Femur.—Notwithstanding the great depth of the acetabulum, the complete manner in which the head of the thigh-bone is received into its cavity, the firmness of the capsular ligament, and the great DISLOCATIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE THIGH BONE, ACCORDING TO ASTLEY COOPER’S CLASSIFICATION.

This is doubtless in a great measure owing to the action, on the head of the femur, of the great length of leverage of the thigh-bone itself when external violence is applied to the knee, and of the J whole of the lower extremity when the violence is applied to the foot. Dislocation of the hip-joint occurs chiefly in young or middle-aged adults In very old people, fracture of the neck of the femur will commonly be pro-

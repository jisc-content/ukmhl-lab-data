PREFACE. VI kindly undertook the revision of the Chapter on the Surgical Treatment of some Uterine and Ovarian Diseasesâ€”a subject for which his special acquaintance with these affections peculiarly fitted him.

It is not sufficient that the Teaching of a Scientific Art, such as Surgery, should be sound in those General Laws that constitute its Principles. It must also be accurate in those minute details that ore

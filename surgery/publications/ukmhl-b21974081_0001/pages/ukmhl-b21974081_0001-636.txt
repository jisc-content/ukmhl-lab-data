SPECIAL FRACTURES. 604 Ivnee, Vol. ii.), with four short splints surrounding the broken bone, forms a J| most excellent apparatus for a fracture of the femur. The end of the splint must he slung to a cradle by a loop of bandage so as to raise it about six inches from the bed (Fig. 237). 7. The starched or plaster-bandage may be employed in most cases. In treating fractures of the shaft of the thigh-bone with the starched bandage, the t| following plan will be found convenient. The limb should be evenly and thickly enveloped in a layer of cotton wadding ; a long piece of strong paste- ■ board, about four inches wide, soaked hi starch, must next be applied to the posterior part of the limb, from the nates to the heel. If the patient be very muscular, and the thigh large, this must be strengthened, especially at its upper part, by having slips of bandage pasted upon it. Two narrower slips of pasteboard are now placed, one along each side of the limb, from the hip to the ankle, and . another shorter piece on the fore part of the thigh. A double layer of starched * Fig. 23S. — Hamilton’s Double Tliigli Splint until Cross Bar. bandage should now be applied over the whole, with a strong and well-starched spica. It should be cut up and trimmed on the second or third day, and then re-applied in the usual way. With such an apparatus as this I have treated many fractured thighs, both in adults and in children, without confiueiuen to bed for more than three or four days, and with little if any shortening or deformity being left] (Fig. 179). The points to be especially attended to are, that the hinder pasteboard-splint be very strong, at the upper put es pecially, and that the spica be well and firmly applied, so that the hip an the whole of the pelvis may be immovably fixed. _ A simple comminuted fracture of the thigh-bone is usually best treate the double inclined plane for the first three weeks, after which it may be pu up in the starched bandage.

124 SPECIAL AMP UTA TTOE'S. an inch and a half or two inches above the angle of the flaps, all the advantages of Teale’s method can be obtained by making an anterior flap equal in length to the diameter of the limb almost rectangular in shape, but having the angles rounded off. A very short posterior flap may be cut to meet this by carrying the knife behind the limb somewhat obliquely from one end of the first incision to the other. The soft parts are then retracted and the bone sawn as high as possible. As in Teale’s method, the flaps should contain all that can 73.—Amputation of the Leg by Long Anterior and Short Posterior Skin flaps, with Circular Division ot the Muscles. be taken from the bones, for in this situation they are somewhat halle to slough.

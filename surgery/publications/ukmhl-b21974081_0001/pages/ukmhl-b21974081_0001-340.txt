INJURIES OF SOFT PARTS. 3° 8 this mode of treatment, the wound having been cleaned and its edges carefully approximated, and if necessary a drainage-tube inserted, the whole part is covered or enclosed in a huge mass of cotton wool, a foot or more in thickness. Over this n bandage is forcibly applied, so as to compress the wool to about half its previous thickness. The dressing is then leit undisturbed ioi a fortnight or three weeks. The temperature is carefully watched during this period, and should there he any considerable rise after the third day the dress- Jn<»■ must be removed at once. Severe pain would be another indication 01 looking at the wound. The principle of the dressing is this ; perfect coapta- tion of the surfaces and the most absolute rest are obtained by the uni oim elastic pressure of the cottonwool; all discharges escape from between the surfaces and are absorbed by the cotton wool, and then dried and thus p - vented from decomposing ; all infection from without is prevented by the filtration of the air should any circulate through the mass ofmotton wool. By this mode of treatment admirable results are often obtained, the wound healing rapidly and painlessly, leaving a simple linear cicatrix. The prevention of nutrefaction is however, very uncertain ; if the discharge is small m amount, and becomes completely dried, the case may run an more commonly there is a very offensive smell, sometimes that of ordinary putrefaction, sometimes quite peculiar. With this there is some septic fever durino- the first few days. Guerin’s dressing has undergone some modi tions &and its principles^ as will be seen hereafter, have been adopted m some forms of antiseptic ^dressing. The substitution of f“*eut woo, ^otton wool comnletelv deprived of grease, for common cotton wool, has leudeiecl drying of the discharge and the consequent prevention of decomposition moie nerfect but even with this it is by no means certain. , T • i,„R The Antiseptic Treatment of Wounds, as introduced by Lister, has foHts object the absolute prevention of decomposition of the di^hOTgesby the application to practice of the germ-theory of decompositom The th y has already been described so fully, that it remain on y to show ^mo its appheatiou.

LATER STAGES OF SCAR-FORM AT ION. 275 of the intercellular substance. This much is certain, however, that, as the fibres make their appearance, the cells disappear to a great extent, until at last only a few flattened corpuscles of the form of those ordinarily found in connective tissue are left lying on the bundles of fibres. At the same time a gradual obli- teration of the vessels which formed so large a part of the granulation-tissue takes place, until the seal- becomes as devoid of vessels as a piece of tendon Owing to the disappearance of so large a number of cells, and the obliteration of such innumerable vessels, this process of development of granulation-tissue into cicatricial fibrous tissue is accompanied by a considerable diminution in bulk, and thus a scar is a ways much smaller than the original raw surface from which it resulted. The new fibrous tissue differs from healthy areolar tissue in being more dense, m containing no lymphatics or lymph-spaces and ne S IZi 4 ^®^®Sc™^n^g™ohgated^cells^ai'aSelnt'0+^ C’ new ePi«>elium covering ’ dt The tlSSU6S ou ea<* side of the^scarcon^iifnumerous feuco^e^ ‘ ^; a " !n tllc a,Jsence of yellow elastic fibres It is fbi« tw • Mg ngidity and want of elasticity V„n, , i fc glVes a scar lfcs nnyield- to resemble normal fibrous tissue more ^ d S°arS are said gradually to come yellow elastic tissue °1G d°Selj’ GVen fco fche <*tent of developing Tlic t" have already seen that the^omltfon of km S‘ nk aCC^rate1^,dcfincd- We commences immedktplv t-n t-i ■ ■ plastic exudation,” or “ lymph ” is finished by % 7^ circumstances new vessels Jan be T ^ Accordi^ to Billroth, the end of a week a complete comma ok r” w,tbin forty-eight hours, and by lanes on each side of the wound Fo,/ 1-°U li establishecl between the capil- engthened out, and the develoomuot /n?.fche SeCOnd WGck the cells have by the end of the second week tl ° ^0U81 fclssue has commenced; and obliterated, and the new tisle lv,« n SUpei'abund‘™t vessels have been partly The fiual obliteration of the ves ■ '.s‘sumc<: a considerable degree of firmness. a Blow process, SnJ®^ d°atriciaI * as all know, remains redder than the^u^o d K8' UnMI this is completed the scar and white. otm lllg s vln’ though afterwards it becomes opaque

With respect to Diagnosis it may be remarked that, as accuracy in this branch is an all-important requisite for success in Treatment, the signs and symptoms by which the injury or disease under consideration may be recognised, have not only been described in each case, but caio has been taken, even at the risk of occasional repetition, to point out the several conditions with which it may be confounded, and the means of distinguishing it from each of them. The Chapter on the Operations practised on the Eye has been omitted. The Author felt that as it was impossible, in a Work on General Surgery, to devote sufficient space to the consideration of so wide and important a Special Department as that of Ophthalmology, it would be better to omit so very limited a part of it as that which concerned only its Operations, when the Diseases for which they were practised could not be described. This omission has been rendered the more necessary as, notwithstanding every care in keeping out superfluous or extraneous matters, the size of the volumes of the present Edition considerably exceeds that of the last. More than thirty years have passed since this Work was first published. During this lengthened period it has met with no incon- siderable amount of favour in this and in other countries. The Author can but hope that the present Edition in its extended and amended form may not be found undeserving of tho continued confidence of the Surgical Profession as a text-book for the Student, and a guide for the Practitioner in Surgery.

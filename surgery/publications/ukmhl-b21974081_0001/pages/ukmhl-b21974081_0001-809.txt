IMPAIRMENT OF SIGHT. 777 1 will develop themselves in succession. The patient is in some cases con- , scions of the circulation in his own eye, which becomes distinctly visible to i him, even in its pulsatory character. _ . . From this description of the symptoms of the impairment ol vision that [ follows spinal injury, it would appear that it is of five distinct kinds, which may, however, be associated : 1. Asthenopia, or simple weakness of sight; 2. Amblyopia, a paresis of the optic nerve or retina; 3. Loss or failure of the i power of accommodation; 4. Irritability of the eye and photopsia from liypermmia ; or inflammation of the optic nerve and retina, which may lead to, 5. Atrophy || of the optic nerve. The objective phenomena presented by the eye, and the ophthalmoscopic Fig. 32S—Use of tlie Optlwlmosco])?. I appearances seen in the interior of the globe in these cases, have been carefully studied by Wharton Jones and Allbutt. Jones, in his able work “ On Failure of Sight after Railway and other Injuries,” states that the eyelids arc usually half closed ; the eyes sunken and watery ; the veins of the eyeball congested. The movements of the pupils are sometimes normal; sometimes more sluggish, sometimes more active than usual. This will necessarily depend upon whether the eye be affected by simple asthenopia, or whether there be some hypermmic or inflammatory state developed in its interior. The ophthalmoscopic appearances vary greatly. In some cases, as Wharton •Jones observes, the morbid state on which the failure of sight and other sub- jective symptoms depend, may be at first confined to some central portion of the optic nervous apparatus, and no ophthalmoscopic evidence of implication o the retina or optic disc may present itself till a more advanced stage of the case Sooner or later, however, whether as the result of primary changes in ie unc us, or more slowly from the efiect of a slowly progressive inflamma-

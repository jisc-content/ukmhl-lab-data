SYPHI.LIS—THE A TMENT— NON-MERC UBIA L. 1099 xi since the separation of the simple chancre from the true syphilitic sore the fact has become clearly recognized that no mode of treatment can prevent the appearance of secondary symptoms; mercury may diminish their sc\ erity 01 delay their appearance, but constitutional syphilis must unavoidably follow the indurated sore, though sometimes the symptoms may be so slight as almost to escape detection. I have seen the non-mercurial plan of treatment very extensively employed at University College Hospital; indeed, it was formerly almost invariably practised there, more particularly in the syphilitic cases occurring among the out-patients under Morton, who strongly advocated it; and I have had repeated occasion to observe the frequency with which it was followed by secondary symptoms. In private practice, also, I have had considerable op- portunities of comparing the two methods, and I can safely say that I have seen the simple treatment more frequently followed by well-marked secondary symptoms than the mercurial plan has been when properly and judiciously employed. The supporters of the non-mercurial treatment, when obliged to admit the great frequency with Avhich it is followed by secondary symptoms, argue that these are less severe after the simple than after the mercurial plan; and they state somewhat dogmatically, and it appears to me without any evidence to support their statement, that mere my and syphilis together form a sort of poisonous compound hi the system, which produces the worst and most destruc- tive forms of constitutional syphilis. I deny entirely that we have any proof of the existence of such a combination as that which is supposed to be produced by syphilis and mercury; no evidence with which I am acquainted has ever been induced in support of the formation of such a poison in the system. It is doubtless true that, after an ill-regulated mercurial course, con- stitutional syphilis of a very severe character may occasionally appear ; but this seems to me to be rather owing to mercury having been improperly administered in constitutions that will not bear it, and in which, by the induction of a cachectic and depraved condition of the system, it favours the occurrence of some of the more severe forms of secondary syphilis, in the same way that any other lowering plan of treatment, or simple debility, might occasion them, but without the exercise of any specifically injurious influence. Some of the worst forms of constitutional syphilis_that I have seen, occurred in patients to whom no mercury had been administered, but in whom the syphilitic virus had been allowed to exercise its influence unchecked, save by the so-called simple treat- ment. I have seen the body covered by immense ecthymatous crusts and sores in one case, rupial ulcers with destruction of the nose and palate in another, the worst kind of syphilitic cachexy with the tuberculo-pustular syphilide in a third, and extensive disease of the cranial bones and the clavicle in a fourth ; in none of which had any mercury been administered. But, though I cannot admit that the supporters of the simple or non-mer- curial treatment of syphilis have brought forward any proof of its superiority over the mercurial plan, and though my own experience has taught me that secondary symptoms occur after it with no less severity than they do when mercury is carefully and judiciously administered, yet I am quite ready to allow that there are certain conditions of syphilis in which the non-mercurial treatment alone is admissible, the state of the constitution or the disease being such that mercury cannot be given in any form. In these cases such a treat- ment must be adopted, in accordance with ordinary medical principles, as will

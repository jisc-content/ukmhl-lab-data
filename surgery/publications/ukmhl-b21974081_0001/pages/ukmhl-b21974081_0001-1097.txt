1065 OPERATIONS IN SCROFULOUS CASES. case in young children, in whom very extensive disease of the hones and join s Lv often be recovered from, without the necessity of any serious suigical interference. Should any operation be undertaken, it is desirable not to have recourse to it whilst the disease is actively spreading. In these circumstances, it is not only probable that suppurative inflammation of an unhealthy kind may he set up in the wound itself, but that disease of the soft parts or bones may recur in the cicatrix of the original wound, or that the corresponding parts on the opposite side of the body may become similarly affected 111 very chronic cases of scrofulous disease of bones and joints. After excision of the elbow, the knee, or the bones of the foot and wrist, the disease will sometimes return in the contiguous soft parts to such an extent as to render a second operation necessary ; the tissues in the neighbourhood of the cicatrix becoming swollen, spongy, and infiltrated with a quantity of gelatinous semi-transparent exuda- tion, running into unhealthy suppuration, with fistulous tracts leading through it that cannot be brought to heal. In some cases even of simple strumous disease of the integuments of the arm, leg, or foot, attended with chronic and intractable ulceration, amputation of the limb is the only course left to the Surgeon. When strumous suppuration leads to hectic, the patient will speedily sink unless the diseased structures be removed.

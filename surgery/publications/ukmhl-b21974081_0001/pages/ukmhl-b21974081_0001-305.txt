EARLY STAGES OF SCAR-FORMATION. 273 septic treatment may become enclosed in a healing wound without causing the formation of pus. 7. Lastly, union by first intention is necessarily prevented by the inocula- tion of the poison of any of the specific spreading inflammations, as hospital gangrene or erysipelas. It now remains to trace the process by which the imperfect union by means of the plastic exudation is converted into permanent healing. Although, as we have seen, inflammation is necessary for the formation of the first bond of union, its absence is equally essential for the healthy development of the scar. The first step in the process is the development of new blood-vessels which penetrate the plastic exudation and finally communicate with similar new vessels from the opposite side of the wound. Small lateral dilatations or pouches, appear at some points-on the walls of the nearest old vessels • these grow out mto the plastic mass, bend towards each other, coalesce, and thus orm loops. These loops give rise to secondary vascular buds, which follow the same course of development, and thus the vascularisation of the plastic exudation is completed. These buds are not formed by mere stretching of the vail ot the ieasel; they are true growths from its protoplasm. It is not cei tam by what means the two buds are guided towards each other until they bnmcUul rnli ’ t! “ “ “0t 1fProbl*le.that follow tile processes of a AnrnmnH*3 ’ T H^10cess of vascularisation commences as soon as the in- h, ™ J °T\ JW0C}Z(haS f0Und distinct lo°Ps commencing to form iniurv pdrohaSv §? nif ^ foi'fcy-ei§’hfc after the infliction of the sixth clay ±7 !Td ^ pr°°eSS is comPlefced by the fifth or r -T' y developed the new vessels are very abundant much more me ,Zma “ T “T ^ “nf *“"• involved in some obscuritv Tw i rfc lls °f granulation-tissue is still 1st.

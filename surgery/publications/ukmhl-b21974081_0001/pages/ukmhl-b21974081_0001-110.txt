73 AMPUTATIONS. eliminated. The cases arc divided first into “ Complicated ” and “Uncom- plicated.” The Complicated cases, which are classed separately, are—Multiple or Double Amputations ; cases complicated with other severe injuries ; cases in which the patient was suffering from severe surgical fever, septicaemia, pyaemia, or tetanus, at the time of the operation ; and, lastly, cases which terminated fatally, or in which the cure was incomplete after many months, on account of acute intercurrent diseases, such as delirium tremens, or acute pneumonia (not of septic origin), or chronic diseases, such as phthisis, Bright’s disease, amyloid degeneration, secondary cancer, &c. Secondly, the cases are divided into those treated antiseptically and those belonging to a period before the introduction of antiseptics and systematic drainage into the treatment of amputation wounds. The former are taken from the published statistics of Socin of Bale, Yolkmann of Halle, and Max Schede in Berlin ; the latter from those of Bruns of Tubingen, Bardeleben of Greifswald, and Billroth, then of Zurich. The cases treated by the older methods showed the following results :— ■ CASES. DIED. PER CENT.

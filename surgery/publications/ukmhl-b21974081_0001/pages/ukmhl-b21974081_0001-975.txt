SEPT10 INFECTION. 943 i and the methods of observation have only lately been brought to any degree of perfection. Those cases of septic infection which arise as a consequence of large wounds, the discharges of which are in a state of decomposition, are necessarily , complicated to a greater or less degree by septic poisoning, and the recognition of the infective process then becomes correspondingly difficult. Although, therefore, at present we are unable always to separate septic poisoning and septic infection in actual practice, it is to be hoped that further observation will enable us to do so, for the importance of the distinction is very great. Septic poisoning is not infectious, and can be relieved by removing the local source of the septic poison ; septic infection, on the other , hand, is supposed to be intensely contagious, and may be readily communicated from one patient to another, and as it is a general or blood-disease no relief can be expected from treatment applied to the local source of infection. Symptoms of Septic Infection.—The disease is usually ushered in by a distinct rigor, often severe, and sometimes repeated more than once. The temperature rapidly rises, reaching 104° F. or 105° F., or even a higher point, during the rigor. The subsequent symptoms closely resemble those already described as occurring during septic poisoning. There is delirium, ending in insensibility, and even in profound coma. The pulse is extremely rapid and quickly becomes feeble. The tongue rapidly becomes dry and brown, and the lips aud teeth are covered with sordes. Diarrhoea or vomiting may occur. The skin assumes a yellowish tint, and purpuric spots may appear on the skin. The temperature may fall and become subnormal before death, or may remain high to the end. Dyspnoea is often a marked symptom before death. In very acute cases death takes place on the second or third day after the commencement of the disease, but life may be prolonged even for a week. The post-mortem appearances are the same as in septic poisoning ; visceral congestions, subserous petechias, early and intense post-mortem staining, and usually a swollen aud softened spleen. In some cases there is pneumonic consolidation of the lung, and there may be pleurisy with blood- staiued effusion. Microscopic organisms have been recognized in the blood in many cases, but at present the disease has not been shown to be associated with a definite form, as in the corresponding affections produced experimentally in animals. Diagnosis.—In the present state of our knowledge it is frequently impos- sible to distinguish septic infection from septic poisoning except in the" definite absence of the cause of the latter condition, as in some poisoned wounds. Septic infection is identical in its symptoms and post-mortem appearances also with the malignant forms of the acute specific fevers in which the patient dies before the characteristic eruption appears, and unless the source of infection is evident the diagnosis may be very doubtful. rognosis. Ihc uncertainty of the diagnosis necessarily interferes with an accurate prognosis ; but when the evidence is strong that the affection is a genuine infective process the case is almost hopeless.

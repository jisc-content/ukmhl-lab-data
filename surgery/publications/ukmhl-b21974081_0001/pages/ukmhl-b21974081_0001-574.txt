FRACTURES. 542 the displacement is angular, and the consolidation not very firm, as is usually the case, this may be done readily enough ; but if the displacement be longi- tudinal, and much time have elapsed since the occurrence of the injury, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to remove the deformity. The bending or breaking of the callus is. best done under the influence of chloroform: the fracture being then put up again, speedy and perfect consolidation will ensue. In this way I have several times remedied a faulty position in fractured bones, although from six to ten weeks had elapsed from the occurrence of the injury. In the majority of cases, the simple force exerted by the unaided strength of the Surgeon will suffice to break the bone. But should several months have o elapsed since the consolidation, the unaided strength will not prove sufficien . In such cases, Butcher has successfully employed a surgical clamp (Fig. 18-), by the pressure of which the bone may be broken across at its displaced angle, even though the faulty union is of several months’duration. . Should the consolidation of the fracture be too firm to admit of re-bending, ^ Rulmdannous osteotomy may be employed in some cases witli Fig. 1S2.—Butcher's Clamp for Re-fracturing a Badly Set Bone.

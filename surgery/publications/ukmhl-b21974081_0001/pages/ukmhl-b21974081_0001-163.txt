AMPUTATION OF T1IE TI1IG1I. *3i tcrior flaps be made here, they will be thin and tendinous in the middle ; whereas the lateral flaps are uniformly thick. Lateral flaps have, however’ |fche disadvantage of leaving the scar over the bone, and they are more difficult to keep in position than antero-posterior flaps, consequently many Surgeons prefer the latter. In the middle and upper thirds of the thigh, I the soft parts are so distributed that the antero-posterior flaps always leave the best result, and give the best covering to the bone. If lateral flaps be made in these situations, the end of the bone is apt to be drawn up mto the angle of the wound between the flaps, which fall away behind it. In amputation m the lower or middle third, a tourniquet may be applied high on the hmb ; but when the operation is done in the upper third, there is no space Fig. 77.—Amputation of the Lower Third of the Thigh by Lateral Flaps. for the application of this instrument, so the hemorrhage must be arrested bv the application of the india-rubber bandage as described on 43 by the rprinf ,tbe omnnf t-i , ' ’ P" 19)* lu whatever situation the Suro-eon arZy or vei“ m“ 0!*1'efll, ‘° C”T the kni,e “ as not t0 sPMt ‘he femoral Amputation above the Knee by Lateral Flaps, or Vermale’s Opera po°nt of tS P‘|f01Td: P Tf .fla|> Sh°"M alwa7s he made first The 55 HKSf5 f? £i= being thenVeZoM Zt fZ718 ™7 aP‘ to bc <P«t.

CHARACTERISTICS OF CONTUSED WOUNDS. 317 but also upon the situation of the injury. If the parts around the wound be much bruised, superficial sloughing to a great extent may occur ; if the wound be deep though not extensive, there will always he danger of deep suppuration and burrowing of matter, leading to troublesome sloughing, and in some cases to secondary haemorrhage. Those wounds that are situated imme- diately over bony points—as the shin and elbow—are especially tedious, as the slough frequently implicates the fasciae, and therefore separates slowly. The scalp has a less tendency to slough than any other part of the cutaneous surface. This is owing to its great vascularity, and to the large supply of blood which it receives from closely subjacent arteries. In all cases of contused and lacerated wounds, in which sloughing and suppuration follow the Fig. 103.—Ring Finger torn off, with deep Flexor Tendon.

In most contused wounds the extent of the slough is, to a certain extent, influenced by treatment. On each side of the wound, beyond the layer of tissue actually killed is an area, frequently of con- siderable extent, in which the tissues are damaged and hovering between life and death, and any additional irritation will suffice to extinguish the remains ° "ta%; Tlins, if such a wound be tightly sewn up the tension of the stitches will inevitably cause sloughing in the whole doubtful area. The un a ion o decomposing discharges is another most potent cause of extension o e aiea of death, and in fact, it is in such wounds much more than in c ean cut incisions, that the immense benefit of some form of antiseptic rea men is most clearly recognized.

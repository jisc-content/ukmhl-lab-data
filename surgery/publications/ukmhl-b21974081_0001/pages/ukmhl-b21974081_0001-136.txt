io4 SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. amputations of the fore-arm were fatal in the ratio of 5, and those of the arm The operation was completed by dividing the tissues in the axilla, between the ends of the two curved incisions previously made to its borders. The most important modification of this method is that of Spence, which is specially adapted for gun-shot wounds of the upper end of the humerus. It consists in carrying the vertical incision further forwards, and commencing it just external to and below the tip of the coracoid process, as in excision of the shoulder-joint. The incision ought to expose the tendon of the long head of the biceps lying parallel to it. This may be turned on one side, and the joint opened and examined ; and if from the state of the parts it be still con- sidered necessary to amputate, the operation is completed by making an oval incision through the skin from the end of the original cut, taking care not to go so deeply on the inner side as to wound the vessels. The outer flap is then dis- sected up, so as to enable the Surgeon to get his knife internal to the head of the bone, between it and the axillary artery (Fig. 51).^The assistant follows the knife with his hands, and grasps the vessels, and the operation is finished by dividing the tissues left uncut at the inner side. In this mode of operating much loss of blood may be saved by securing the vessels cut in the first part of the operation before opening the joint and proceeding to the division of the tissues at the inner side of the arm.

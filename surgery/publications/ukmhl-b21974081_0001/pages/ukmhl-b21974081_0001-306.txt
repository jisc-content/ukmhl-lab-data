THE PROCESS OF REPAIR. 274 inserted beneath the skin, and in portions of dead tissue inserted in the peri- toneal cavity of a rabbit; and on reading the results of their experiments, it is difficult not to believe that the new tissue may be developed from migrating cells. On the other hand, Senftleben has clearly shown that in the cornea by a special mode of experimenting, a loss of substance may be obtained without causing inflammation, and that, under these circumstances, the corneal cor- puscles can be seen to take a direct part in the process of repair. Whatever the origin of the new cells in granulation-tissue may be, the sub- sequent changes by which the soft, highly vascular cellular mass is converted Fig. 100.—Granulation-tissue, x S00. A.

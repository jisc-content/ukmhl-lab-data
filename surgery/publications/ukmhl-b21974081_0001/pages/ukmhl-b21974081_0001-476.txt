ARREST OF ARTERIAL HAEMORRHAGE. 444 wadding, and laid on its outer side after the operation. If the weather be cold, hot-water bottles may be put into the bed, but not in contact with the limb. Should there be any appearance of stagnation of venous blood, the plan recommended by Guthrie of employing continuous and methodical friction in a direction upwards for twenty-four hours, so as to keep the superficial veins emptied, may be practised. _ When mortification has fairly set in; amputation of the limb should be per- formed at once as the only chance of saving life, in all those cases in which the patient’s constitutional powers are sufficiently strong to enable him to bear the shock of the operation. The limb should be removed at the seat of the oiigmal wound, or opposite the point at which the artery has been tied. In those cases, however, in which the gangrene follows injury of the femoral artery just below Poupart’s ligament, Guthrie advises that the amputation shoidd be done below the knee, where the gangrene usually stops for a time. If the gangrene spread, with oedema or serous infiltration of the limb, the amputation should be done high up—at the shoulder-joint, or in the upper third of the thigh. In these cases a large number of vessels usually require ligature, having been enlarged by the collateral circulation.

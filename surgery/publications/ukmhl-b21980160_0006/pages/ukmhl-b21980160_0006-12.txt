VI PREFACE, Since this publication of Heifter’s, many va- luable difcoveries and important improvements have been introduced ; and the Public has at different times been favoured with accounts of them by their refpedlive authors. But thefe pub- lications treat of various fubjefts, and are all ne- ceffarily unconnected with each other ; fo that the additional knowledge with which our art has been of late enriched, lies in a very diffufed, and to many perhaps in an inacceflible, fituation. It is true, that fome attempts have been made towards a full fyftematic arrangement of chirur- gical fubjeCls. Plainer publifhed his Inftitutes of Surgery in the year 1745 ; and Ludwig fa- voured the world with a fimilar publication in 1767. But both thefe works may be properly confidered as heads of leCtures which were read by thofe celebrated profelfors at Leipfic ; and al- though pofTeffcd of much merit, they are too concife to give a clear and diflinCl idea of the various topics of which they treat. In confequence of this, the young ftudent in the art, as well as the intelligent praCfitioner who is defirous of information, is obliged to con- fult a great variety of publications, which he fre- quently finds much difficulty in procuring, and which his other occupations will not always al- low him fufficicnttime to perufe.

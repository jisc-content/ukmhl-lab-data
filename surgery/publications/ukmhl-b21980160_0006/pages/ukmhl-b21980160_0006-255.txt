Sedl. II. Of Aneurfms. 237 ! artery has been found to be on the anterior part of the tumor, and in fuch a Iituation the wound in it would no doubt prove ac- [! ceflible enough. This, however, is a very rare occurrence, as in almofl every inftance of diffufed aneurifm the artery lies at the I very bottom of the tumor, the blood being colle(fled between it and the com- I mon teguments ; and accordingly I have I feen feveral inftances of this diforder, in i which, after the tumor was laid freely open, the artery was found to lie fo deep as would have rendered it quite impoffible I to perform this operation. I But there is another very material ob- jedlion which a priori evidently occurs to I the pra6lice recommended by Mr Lam- I bert. By introducing a needle throâ€™ the lides of the orifice, and drawing thefe to- gether by a ligature, the cavity of the ar- I tery muft undoubtedly be at that point (j much diminifhed. Indeed Mr Lambert, in his account of the cafe in which this ope- l ration was performed, acknowledges that ! the diameter of the artery was thereby di- minifhed.

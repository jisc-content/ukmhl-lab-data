If that fhould not be found to anfwer, a comprefs of linen fliould be applied over it, the whole being then to be fecured with a roller. It happens, however, in fome inftances, that this does not fucceed, the orifice con- tinuing to burfi; out from time to time, fo jls to be produdlive of much diftrefs and inconvenience.

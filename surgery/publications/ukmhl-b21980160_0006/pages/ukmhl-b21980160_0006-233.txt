Sea. I. Of Aneurifms, ' 217 flop to the circulation in the part, if the artery be large, there would be the utmoft hazard the ufual operation of obliterating the cavity of the artery, is feldom, if ever, neceffary. In a letter I am favoured with from Dr Hunter, he fays, “ The Lady in whom I firfl; obferved the vari- cofe aneurifm is now living at Bath in good health; and the arm is in no fenfe worfe, although it is now thirty-five years fince flie received the injury.” And the Do£l;or farther obferves, that he never heard of the operation being performed for the varigofe aneu- rifm that was known to be fuch. In a letter from Dr William Cleghorn of Dublin I am informed, that the cafe of varipofe aneurifm above- mentioned, as related in the 3d Volume of London Medical Obfervations, remains nearly in the fame ftate as at the time that account of it was made oot, which was at lead twenty years ago; only that the veins are rather more enlarged. The patient recovered, and the limb became nearly as ftrong and ferviceable as the other. The man has all along continued his bu- finefs of fhoemaker, and has lately recovered from a fprain in the affeded arm, which he received in lift- ing a heavy burden. In a letter from Mr Pott, whofe opportunities for ob- fervation are great, he fays, that he has met with three different inftances of this fpecies of aneurifm, and that the operation never became neceffary in any of them.

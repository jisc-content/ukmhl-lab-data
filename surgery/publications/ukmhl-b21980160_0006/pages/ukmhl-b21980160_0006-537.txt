Chap. V Hi Of the Hematocele. 491 a hydrocele, as it has fometimes been, and an opening with a trocar is made into it, a difcharge is produced, of a dark, dulky- coloured blood, nearly of the confiflence of thin chocolate ; but although fome di- minution may be made in the fize of the tumor, by the evacuation thus obtained, yet no conllderable alteration is elFedled by it. Any perforation that is made into it, ac- cordingly does no good; and as the teflicle is commonly fo far fpoiled by the difeafe as to be rendered quite ufelefs, caftration is advifed as the only effedual remedy *. I have different times met with a difeafe very fimilar to this defcribed by Mr Pott: But as the blood in fuch inftances did not appear to be extravafated, but to be ftill contained in the veffels of the teftis in an enlarged varicofe ftate, I would not incline, therefore, to refer this kind of tumor to any fpecies of haematocele. I have even feen this diforder miftaken for a hydrocele, and treated as fuch, by a trocar being plunged * Mr Pottâ€™s Treatife on the Hydrocele.

Sec^l. III. Of the Hydrocele, 425 of which terminated fatally ; and in the other a mortification enfued, which in the fpace of a few days deftroyed not only a good deal of the fcromm, but even a confi- derable portion of the tunica vaginalis*.. Both of thefe indeed occurred in very un- healthy conftitutions ; but it is proper to have it known, that this operation may ia fuch habits of body be produdlive of thefe confequences. In found healthy people, it feldom or never ends in any thing bad; but the event of thefe cafes of Mr Pott and others, ought to convince us that it fhould not be attempted where the fyfiem is evi- dently much difeafed. Drawing the water off in this manner in order to relieve the patient from the bulk it produced, was the firft idea that ocur- red to pradlitioners in the treatment of the hydrocele; but this being found inefFec- tual for the complete removal of the dif- eafe, various other methods were afterwards introduced. The adlual cautery and the ligature were both propofed as means of pre- ^ Cafes xxi. and xxil. Treatife on the Hydrocele.

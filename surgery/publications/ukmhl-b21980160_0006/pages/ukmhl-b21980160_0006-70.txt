Of the Ligature Chap. II, For the purpofe of effeding this with eafe and fafety, various kinds of the inftru- ment termed a forceps have been invented; with thefe, the arteries of a fore are laid hold of and pulled out, fo as to admit of the application of ligatures. For the larger blood-veffels, the forceps has been found to anfwer conveniently enough; but, in the fmaller arteries, they are by no means fo fit for the purpofe as the inftrument or hook I have been recom- mending, termed a tenaculum, and repre- fented in Plate I. And as a hook of this form anfwers equally <well in the larger ar- teries likewife, the ufe of the forceps may therefore be laid entirely afide. The man- ner of ufing the tenaculum is this. In order to deted the arteries to be tied, the tourniquet with which they are fecured, mud be flackened a little by a turn or two of the fcrew; and the moment the largeft artery of the fore is difcovered, the furgeon fixes his eye upon it, and im- mediately reftrains the blood again by means of the tourniquet.

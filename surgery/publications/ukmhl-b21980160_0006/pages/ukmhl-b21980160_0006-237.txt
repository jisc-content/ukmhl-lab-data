Thefe particulars I thought it right to communi- cate, as the cafe of this patient is one of a very few •well authenticated inftances, of this operation having been attempted on the femoral artery fo near to its origin ; and the fuccefs attending it furely points out the propriety of having recourfe to the operation, in every aneurifm of thefe parts that does not evidently arife from a general debility of the coats of the artery. And as I am favoured with this account of the cafe from the prefent profeflbr of Anatomy in Glafgow, Mr Hamilton, fo» to the late profelTor, its authenti- city may be depended on. In Vol. III. Article XII. of the London Medical ^ Obfervations, there is another inftance related of the operation for the aneurifm having been performed on the trunk of the femoral artery, by Mr Burchal fur- geon in Manchefter; the patient recovered, and the limb became nearly as ftrong and as ferviceable as the other.

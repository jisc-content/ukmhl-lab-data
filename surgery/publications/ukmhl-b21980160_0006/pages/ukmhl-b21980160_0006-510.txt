And when, along with this and other fymptoms of hernia, we evidently difcover in the tumor of the fcrotum a fludluation of a fluid, if this fluid can by preflure be made to difappear either entirely or in part, the nature of the diforder is thus rendered obvious. This fpecies of hydrocele may occur as readily in the hernia congenita, as in any other variety of rupture; and in that event, the water mufl for certain be con- tained in the fame fac both with the tef- ticle and protruded inteflines.

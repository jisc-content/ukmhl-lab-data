But this future, it may be remarked, is much more neatly, and at the fame time more eahly performed, by palling both ends of the thread from with- in outwards ; which is readily done by ufing two needles upon each thread, in- ftead of one. A needle being put upon each end of the fame thread, and each needle being inferred at the bottom of the fore, and puflied outwardly fo as to pafs out at a proper diftance from the edge of the wound, the needles are then to be taken off, and the threads allowed to remain till all the ligatures are palled which the ex- tent of fore feems to require. The number of ligatures necelTary for any wound, muft in a great meafure de- pend upon the extent of divided parts. By authors in general it has been laid down as an eftablilhed rule, that one future is fully fufticient for every inch of wound. It will frequently indeed happen, that this number is found fufticient; but infome in- ftances.

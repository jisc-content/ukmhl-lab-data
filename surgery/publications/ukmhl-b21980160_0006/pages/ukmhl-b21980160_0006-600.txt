55^ Amputation of the 'Uenh, Qiap. X, dered callous, and a dear opening be thu^ preferved. But when any opening is dif- Govered, although it fhould not be pro* perly placed, yet if it affords i temporary paflage to the urine, it is better to delay the operation till the patient is fomewhat advanced in life j and on an opening being then made with a trocar in the manner we have mentionedj^ a piece of flexible cathe- ter may be introduced, not only for pre- ferving the paflage free and pervious, but for carrying off the water till a cure i^ obtained. In the earlier periods of child* hood, the fmallnefs of parts through which it ought to pafs, renders the flexible cathe- ter altogether inadmiflible. Independently of thefe affedions of the penis which we have been juft confidering, flftulous openings frequently occur in the urethra, and they are always produdive of much diftrefs. Thefe we Ihall attend to when we come to treat of the yiftula in Ano and Perinaeo; and the treatment of Stones impaded in the Urethra, will fall to be confidered under the operation of Lithotomy.

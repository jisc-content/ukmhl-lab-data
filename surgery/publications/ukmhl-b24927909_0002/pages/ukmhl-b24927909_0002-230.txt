ON DISEASES 222 unfold it. There were numerous sores of an oblong form in the transverse direction, appearing like chops, covered by adhering pus. I told the patient that it was necessary to enquire whether there were any cause maintaining this irritable state of the pre- puce, and mentioned that I had observed it very frequently to depend upon strictures of the urethra. The patient had no suspicion that he had such disorder, for he voided his urine readily, and not much more frequently than is common. Upon examining with a bougie, however, several much contracted and very firm strictures were discovered; and these being relieved, the sores on the prepuce healed without any further attention, than what cleanliness required. The foreskin be- came soft and pliant, as did also the skin which lined it, and is extended over the glans. This case occurred many years ago; and as I have not seen the patient since, I conclude that the relief which he thus ob- tained was permanent.

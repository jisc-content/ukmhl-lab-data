ON DISEASES 188 opinions are correct. First, then, it has ap- peared to me that a state of inflammation and irritation may take place in the remote part of the urethra to a greater or less extent. It may produce in the prostate that peculiar sensibility of the part which I have described; and in the perinaeum it may cause contrac- tions of different parts of the canal. Either of these affections may be more permanent than the other, even where each part has been equally affected in the beginning. This state of inflammation and irritation is frequently produced by gonorrhoea, though it may occur from other causes. If a bougie be introduced injudiciously, when this dis- order first occurs in a gonorrhoea, numerous spasmodic strictures * are met with; the patient becomes alarmed by the difficulty of passing the instrument, and by the name of strictures, and consults a more experienced surgeon, who directs local warm bathing, and the application of leeches to the perinaeum. * I have used the term spasmodic strictures in the in- discriminate manner in which it is generally employed, though I am aware that it is objectionable: a stricture from spasm is not a stricture; and a stricture may be irritable or spasmodical, or otherwise.

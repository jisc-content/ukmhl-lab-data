â€˜20 9 OF THE URETHRA, SiC. in them may occur from constitutional causes, and more apparently from a disorder of the digestive organs, I need not then urge the propriety of our endeavouring to keep the latter organs, as nearly as possible, in a state of health, whilst we are endeavouring to relieve the diseases of the former by local measures. Of the beneficial effects of such conduct, I could relate many instances, but it does not seem necessary to detail cases in proof of so self-evident a proposition. I have explained, in the first volume, my ideas of the mode by which relieving disorders of the digestive organs relieves and cures local diseases; and in local diseases of the pelvic viscera another reason may be suggested for the benefit which is obtained. It has been observed, that in disorders of the digestive organs, the lower part of the intestinal canal is frequently most affected. Irritation in the rectum must affect the plexus of nerves, from which not only that intestine, but the pelvic viscera in common derive their ener- gies; and thus it may lead to a similar participation of disease. .1 ; VOL.

22 ON DISEASES of a sixpence, which he showed me, and which I affirmed had not the thickened edge and base, and other characters of a venereal chancre. I therefore recommended him to try the effect of local means, and not to use mercury.

At this time pain was felt extending up the arm, and suddenly a considerable tumour arose over the absorbing vessels, which proceed along the inner edge of the biceps muscle. This tumour became nearly as big as a small orange.

Under this treatment the tumour was dis- cussed, and the sore at the same time healed. 22

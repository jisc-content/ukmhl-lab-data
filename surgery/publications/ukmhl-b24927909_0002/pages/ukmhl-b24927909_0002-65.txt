RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 57 would probably err in the same manner; and his dislike to disorder the constitution by mercury would probably lead him even to use it more freely than might be absolutely necessary : this he would do in cases clearly syphilitic, in order to prevent the possibility of the recurrence of disease, and repetition of a mercurial course. In doubtful cases, which are cured by exciting mercurial ac- tion in the constitution, he would adopt a similar mode of treatment, in order to sup- press the disease for so long a time as to make it less likely to recur ; or if any subse- quent disease should take place, to render it highly probable that this was not syphilitic, since it had broken out after such a course of mercury as must be considered to be ade- quate to the cure of almost any disease of that nature. By undertaking this task I shall perhaps comply with the wishes of my other friends, in stating more explicitly the cir- cumstances which should induce a surgeon O immediately to use or abstain from the ad- ministration of mercury, and, at the same time, contribute my mite of observation to those already offered on this still obscure subject of venereal diseases.

ON DISEASES 90 or refuted by the general experience of sur- geons. The cases, which would tend to establish it, must be of rare occurrence. * Most of the instances, to which I have al- luded, occurred in men who had been lonjr married, and on whose veracity I could rely. There is also, in my opinion, sufficient in- trinsic evidence in each case to prove that the disease was not venereal. It was this kind of cases which I had in view in my last publication, in discussing the question whether those diseases, which may be de- nominated pseudo-syphilitic, arise from some modification of the venereal poison, or from a peculiarity of constitution in the patients who are exposed to the action of truly syphilitic virus. I have there said, that “ it deserves to be observed that dis- eases resembling syphilis do occur, without any reason to suppose that any morbific poison has been admitted into the system.” I have been induced to dwell upon this subject, which may, perhaps, be considered more speculative than useful, because if the opinion were verified, it would explain the occurrence of pseudo-syphilitic diseases in a very striking and satisfactory manner.

105 RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. through the winter without any relapse. In about a year afterwards he had some rheu- matic complaints, from which he soon recovered, and has continued well since, ex- cept that he has been subject to occasional returns of rheumatism. * CASE XV. A gentleman about thirty years of age, of a healthy robust habit, had a sore behind the corona glandis, which I saw on the third or fourth day after its appearance. It was then nearly as large as the nail of the finger, and so deep as to descend to the ligamen- tous substance of the corpus cavernosum penis. It was indurated in its circumference. * The chief circumstances, which seem to me to de- serve attention in this case, are, that probably infectious matter was absorbed, without any evident breach of surface or primary sore; that the constitutional symp- toms were at first suddenly cured by a small quantity of mercury; that afterwards the use of mercury rather aggravated them, in consequence of which it was dis- continued ; that the disorder of the constitution after- wards gradually subsided ; and that the whole of the mercury employed seems quite insufficient for the cure of syphilis.

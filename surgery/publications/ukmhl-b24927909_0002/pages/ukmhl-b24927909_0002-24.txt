ON DISEASES 16 ing the constitution, when other modes of administering mercury had failed to pro- duce its specific effect. * CASE V. A young man had a chancre by the side of thefragnum preputii, which had all the charac- ters of true syphilis. It was of acircular form, with a thickened edge and base; there were no granulations, and matter adhered to the sur- face. For this, he took mercurial pills in large quantities, which never affected his mouth, though occasionally they produced griping # It is not my intention to republish the cases in proof of this fact, because I think that the present one is suf- ficient to evince its truth. It seems, however, right to mention that my opinions on this subject are unaltered, and to repeat, that I have found mercurial fumigations employed in the manner recommended by the Chevalier Lalonette, a physician in Paris, in 1776, to be, in the ma- jority of instances, a more powerful and innocent means of producing a mercurial affection of the constitution than in unction or the internal use of mercury, and equally certain of radically curing the disease for which it has been thus administered. The fumigating powder which I have used instead of L'donetteâ€™s is calomel washed in water, containing a small quantity of ammonia, so that the powder may be deprived of its muriatic acid, and assume a dark grey colour.

14? RESEMBLING S1PHILIS. l 2 I have already said, that sores which indurate in their circumference do not in every instance produce constitutional symp- toms. Apprized of their nature, I gene- rally order for the patients that dose of mercury which may be taken without affect- ing the constitution, as a discutient of the hardness, and I have known nearly six months elapse before it has been com- pletely dispersed. This kind of partial in- duration is so different from the progress of true syphilis, that I think it must be readily granted not to be of that nature. It must, however, be also remembered, that sores which indurate in all parts are not always syphilitic. As I have already related two instances, I think it unnecessary to add more. Having thus endeavoured to represent the constitutional effects resulting from sores, which differ materially in their characters and progress from syphilitic chancres, I wish to subjoin another case, though I am doubtful whether the disease originated from infection, or was the product of constitu- tional disorder. I think it deserves to be recorded on account of its duration.

resembling syphilis. 73 healthy. They generally get well as the dis- ease returns to its original situation in the urethra. I merely mention these circum- stances to induce attention, and to prevent surgeons from confounding the sores which I have been describing with any other simi- larly situated, but different in their nature. I wish also to excite attention to another species of sores which I have frequently met with, and which differ considerably in their progress from those truly syphilitic. The first appearances of the sores are various, but in their progress a thickening in the surrounding parts takes place, whilst the centre is soft and less diseased than the cir- cumference. I have seen the surrounding parts much elevated, and an opening leading into a cavity in the middle. I have seen them, on the contrary, heal with a flat sur- face, and acquire a circular hardness, the middle being quite soft, and the area of the circle gradually increase. I have known sores heal apparently well and smoothly, and afterwards the edge has acquired a circular hardness like a ring of some firm substance.

184 ON DISEASES fairly drawn from this; viz. that a disease may occur in the membrane of the urethra where it passes through the prostate, and that it may render the bladder irritable, and produce stricture in the urethra; for in this case there was no mechanical obstruction to the expulsion of the urine to produce irri- tation in the bladder. It also appears that the disease admitted of relief by the intro- duction of a bougie. I have lately met with another case in a younger man, who is between twenty and thirty years of age, and who was afflicted with similar fits ofdysury, the cause of which could not be ascertained. I passed a bougie for him a few times, but found no stricture in the urethra. The same painful sensations were produced in the prostate, as in the preceding cases. The bougie did not ap- pear at the time to relieve the dysury; but the complaint gradually ceased, and the patient left town. He has been much better since this time, and attributes his relief to the passage of the bougie.

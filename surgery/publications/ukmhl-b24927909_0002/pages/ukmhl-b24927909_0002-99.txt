RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 91 If local diseases resembling syphilis may take place in the throat, skin, and bones, from a certain state of weakness, and irri- tability of constitution, then various modi- fications of animal matter being absorbed, may so disorder the general health as to induce such a state of weakness and irrita- tion, as is likely to produce those symptoms, and such symptoms are rather to be re- garded as arising from the propensities of the constitution, than from the peculiar properties of the matter which has been imbibed. It is shown in my former publi- cation, that the poison which produces pseudo-syphilitic symptoms is sometimes absorbed without an evident breach of sur- face in the skin; sometimes from a trivial sore which soon heals; whilst in other cases, it produces local sores of various and dissimilar characters.

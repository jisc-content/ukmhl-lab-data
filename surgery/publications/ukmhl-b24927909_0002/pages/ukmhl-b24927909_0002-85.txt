I hope it will be seen that I do not presume, nor do I see cause, to deviate from the established rules of prac- tice founded on the general experience of surgeons. It would, indeed, in my opinion, be presumptuous in an individual to form general rules drawn from his scanty expe- rience ; I may be allowed, however, to re- mark, that individuals of the profession are likely to err by inferences drawn from their own practice ; and it appears to me that some professional men atpresent are inclined to believe all sores arising from impure con- nexion to be syphilitic, whilst others may be too scrupulous in expecting all syphilitic sores to possess their common characters.

But such an account never can be given by one, who

If then we may, for the reasons above stated, employ mer- cury without hesitation in primary infected sores, being governed with respect to the degree and duration of its use by its ef- fects, we ought, as has been shown in the preceding part of this chapter, to pursue the reverse conduct with respect to consti- tutional symptoms. Here we are required to hesitate, that we may learn the nature of the disease previous to attempting its cure.

171 RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. reason in the second section. Well aware how liable an individual is to err, in form- ing general conclusions from his own limited ^experience, and conscious that the opinions which I entertained respecting these diseases were different from those of a great number of eminent surgeons, I at first published my observations on the subject in portions ; and the same apprehension as to the pos- sibility of error has now induced me to re- publish them in a less methodical manner than I could have wished. I thought this mode would show better the rise andprogress of those opinions which I cannot but enter- tain ; inasmuch, as they appear legitimately to be deduced from facts. Had I published all I knew and thought relative to these subjects under another title, had I called the book additional observations on venereal diseases, or on progressive and remittent syphilis, it might have been better received, because it might have been more accordant to the notions of others. Yet in whatever way I might have represented the subject, the difference would only have been in the manner of displaying it; there would have beennoneinthe mattertowhich it related, as that consists of actual occurrences in practice.

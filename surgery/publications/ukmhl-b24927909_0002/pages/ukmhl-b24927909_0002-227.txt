219 OF THE URETHRA, &C. months had elapsed, the patient consulted me relative to sores which frequently broke out upon the prepuce ; some of which were very tardy in healing. He also was subject to a considerable collection of that substance which is secreted to moisten and lubricate the prepuce. I told him that these symptoms were the effects of irritation of the prepuce, and was led to enquire more particularly into the state of the urethra than I had done before, because I thought both the disorder of the testis and the prepuce might originate in the same cause, that is, disease in the urethra. On examining that canal with a bougie, I found strictures, and a tender state of it where it passes through the prostate. By local warm bathing, and the occasional and gentle use of bougies, the morbid sen- sibility of the canal was diminished. The strictures were touched with kali purum; means, would prosecute the same measures in an indolent, and, as I may call it, dropsical hydrocele ; or finding the means fail in many cases from their indiscriminate use, he may be induced to consider the treatment upon the whole as inefficacious; and thus neglect it in cases in Vvhich it is likely to be beneficial.

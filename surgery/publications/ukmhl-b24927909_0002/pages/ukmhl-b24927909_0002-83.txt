I have known many diseases which burrow in this manner treated as syphilitic, and, as the event of the cases has proved, improperly. Indeed, the progress of such diseases is so different from that of syphilis, that it is na- tural to discredit their being so. Diseases which proceed in this manner seem to be of an irritable nature, and to affect most those parts which have least powers of life, which appears to be the cause of their peculiar mode of extending themselves.

206 ON DISEASES origin, producing such various complaints ; and I repeat, that I have known such dysury lead to actual disease of the affected organs. It is very common for men who have been married many years, and who, perhaps, never had gonorrhoea (or if they had in their youth, it is probable that it had left no disorder in the canal of the urethra,) to gradually acquire, as they advance in life, diseases of the urinary organs. Surely, then, the origin of such diseases must be regarded as spontaneous, and likely to be induced and maintained by whatever oc- casions irritation in the affected organs. There is, however, no period of life ex- empt from this kind of dysury. Children are frequently much affected by it, and at that age when the bodily powers are gene- rally in the greatest vigour ; if they become disordered, dysury occurs in common with other diseases.

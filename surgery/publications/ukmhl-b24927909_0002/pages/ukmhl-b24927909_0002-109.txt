The cases, which I shall now bring for- ward, are selected, because I think they show as great a variety of circumstances incidentals these diseases as could be dis- played in an equal number of examples. I could have crowded the book with instances, tending more directly to illustrate and con- firm the opinions delivered in it. My object has, however, been, not to represent the subject as more clear than it will appear in practice.

I undertake the task reluctantly, because the brevity with which I must speak of these subjects may render my opinions liable to misapprehension, and because I do not feel competent to its proper performance. Yet by this means, I think I shall do away the objection of one of my medical friends ; for I believe that I am myself more likely to err in recommending the too free than the too sparing administration of mercury in syphi- litic diseases.

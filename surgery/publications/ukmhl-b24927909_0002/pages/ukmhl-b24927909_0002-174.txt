ON DISEASES 16G can be given in addition to alterative doses of mercury, yet, when the constitution of the patient is weak, it is useful to give me- dicines of a tonic and cordial kind. This practice is peculiarly proper, when it re- quires a more powerful operation of mer- cury than I have in general described, to control and cure urgent symptoms.* Such is the result of the observations I have made on the treatment of these most * It may be thought by some, that I have relied too much in the treatment of the foregoing diseases, upon the internal administration of mercury, and have not suffi- ciently tried its effects by inunction. I therefore think it right to explain, that it seems to me immaterial, whether a mild oxyd of mercury, such as should be contained in mercurial ointment, and quicksilver pills, is absorbed from the skin or the alimentary canal. I generally find that as much of the quicksilver pill can be taken internally as is necessary to produce the degree of mercurial affec- tion of the system, which is requisite for the cure of pseu- do-syphilitic symptoms, without in the least disordering the functions of the digestive organs; but, on the contrary, with evident benefit by exciting and maintaining the na- tural and healthy actions of those organs. It is right, however, to add, that the pilul. hydrarg. which I have always employed, has been procured from the Apothecariesâ€™ Hall; and that when it has been ob- tained from other places, its effects have by no means corresponded to what I have represented of them, either in this or the preceding volume.

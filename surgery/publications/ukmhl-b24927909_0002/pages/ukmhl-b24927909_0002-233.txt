OF THE URETHRA, &C. 225 strictures had been touched with kali, and the constant use of bougie desisted from, the phymosis relaxed, and the prepuce could be retracted without the least difficulty or un- At length his urethra became so irritable, that he could scarcely void his urine, which he was frequently called upon to attempt. Apprehensive of caustic bougies being employed, he consulted me, and I found I could introduce a small bougie without much difficulty: it halted at several strictures, but with very gentle pressure it passed through them. I recommended him to bathe the pe- rineum and contiguous parts with warm water, by means of a sponge, night and morning, and told him I wished to introduce the bougie again after three days had elapsed. He was extremely apprehensive that the passage would completely close during the interval, and strongly remonstrated against such inefficient practice. On the third day he acknowledged that he passed his urine more freely, and the bougie which 1 had first introduced went through the urethra without impediment. I took one of a little larger size, and passed it with the same sort of resistance which the first had met with. The warm bathing was continued, and by pursuing these measures for three weeks I passed a bougie one-third larger than he had been able at the best of times to do for many years. The patient now voided his urine in a large stream, and not more frequently than is common; in short, he felt himself perfectly well. Since that time, no bougie has been introduced, except once, annually by myself, that he might he assured that the stricture had in no degree contracted. VOL. II. Q

RESEMBLJNG SYPHILIS. s induced on the genitals, by sexual inter- course, which are not the effects of the ve- neral poison, and that many of them infect the constitution, and produce secondary symptoms resembling those of that disorder. It may be asked, however, if these diseases be not venereal, what are they ? As they are all the consequence of sexual inter- course, they may, in one sense of the word, be said to be venereal. To avoid ambiguity, therefore, I shall in these pages denominate that disease which broke out at the siege of Naples, and which M r. Hunter has described as the venereal dissase, by the name given to it by nosological writers, that is, Syphilis ; and I shall call those diseases, which differ from it in their progress and mode of becoming well, though they strikingly re- semble it in appearance, by a name import- ing these circumstances, that is, Pseudo- Syphilitic Diseases. To prepare the mind of the reader to take an impartial survey of these subjects, I think it will be useful to make a few pre- liminary observations relative to the pro- bable origin of pseudo-syphilitic diseases. b 2

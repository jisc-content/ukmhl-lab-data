Some of these sores spread by ulceration, and some by sloughing, of which instances are related in the first sec- tion of this paper. Even Celsus has de- scribed several species of sores, which, as Dr. Adams has observed, we are acquainted with in the present day. I have never seen that phagedsenic ulcer, which suddenly sloughs, affect the constitution : neither do I believe * that surgeons in general have remarked it; those who regard all these sores as syphi- litic attribute the absence of secondary symptoms to the chancre having been re- moved by the sloughing of the surrounding parts.

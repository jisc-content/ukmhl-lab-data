ON DISEASES 148 In the year 1793, a gentleman aged twenty-six, who had been married two years, had a paralytic affection of the whole of the left side, from which he gra- dually but not completely recovered in about nine months, the latter of which he spent in the country, and he attributed much benefit to the country air. About four months from the commencement of the paralysis, he had an indolent enlarge- ment of the testis as big as a' large fist, which did not subside, but in 1796 suppu- rated, broke, and very slowly got well. In . 1797, he had an ulcerated sore throat, for which he went through a very regular and severe course of mercury. He was con- fined from July to November, and the mouth was in a greater or less degree affected during the greater part of that time. The throat soon got well. The year 1798 he spent in the country, and regained his health and strength in a very considerable degree. In 1802, a node appeared about the middle of the right shin, which was removed by a blister kept open for some time. He had at the same time a pimple on the nose which formed a scabby ulcer, but slowly got well

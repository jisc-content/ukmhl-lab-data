ON DISEASES 198 bid sensibility of parts is diminished by it This happened in the three first cases in a remarkable degree, and I have known it take place in many others. Nor is there any thing in this event that should excite surprise : every surgeon is familiar with the same circumstance, with relation to stric- tures in the urethra. The first introductions of a bougie are very painful; the subse- quent ones become to be even disregarded. Still, however, I think it may be useful to dwell a little on this subject, and to consider the probable causes of these effects, as it may tend to establish rules for our conduct in practice. It appears to me, that we diminish the morbid as well as the natural sensibility of parts by doing them a degree of violence, short of that which produces a kind of re-action in them, by which their sensibility is heightened. This is, indeed, the consideration which guides my practice in these and in many other cases. If, even in strictures of the urethra, the sensibility of the canal becomes increased by the in- troduction of bougies, or, in other words, if inflammation is excited, surely it is wrong to prosecute such measures at this juncture.

200 ON DISEASES prostatic part of the urethra is not relieved by the measures which have been suggested, I pass the bougie through the last stricture, without carrying it on, so as to irritate the tender part of the urethra, which lies behind it. A knowledge of the nature of diseases cannot but be desirable, even though it does not enable us to cure them all. If strictures are removed, and dysury remains, I believe it is common to consider it as arising from an irritable bladder; now, though this may be generally true, there are many exceptions. I do not find that attention is paid to the description of cases, which makes the subject of the present paper: I was unacquainted with them till I met with the cases which I first men- tioned ; the knowledge which I have thus obtained has enabled me to afford relief in many cases, and has prevented me from error in others.

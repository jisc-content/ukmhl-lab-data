ON DISEASES ISS these complaintsgraduallydisappeared. His health, however, was still disordered, and new symptoms came on. His nose became slightly affected, and he had pains in his bones. He now removed to the sea-side, and after continuing there for a considerable time, he wrote to me, saying, that ulceration had taken place in his nose, which had de- stroyed the septum narium, and that the in- teguments, covering a kind of node on one shin, had formed into a foul and fretful sore. I now recommended an alterative mercurial course. He took five grains of pil. hydrarg. at night, and a pint of the decoct, sarsse daily; and in the course of four or five weeks he was apparently well, having ac- quired health and strength at the same time. In a second letter he expressed his great sur- prize at his amendm ent, and wished for my further directions. I then desired he would take the pil. hydrarg. every second night, if the state of the biliary secretion required it; but as that was not the case he took no more of that medicine, and has since remained perfectly well.

RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 39 d 4 me within the space of a few months, and because sufficient time has elapsed since their occurrence to show that there is no probability that there will be any recurrence of these or similar symptoms. It must be allowed that they are incontestable instances of diseases getting well without mercury, which could not be distinguished by mere inspection from similar diseases truly sy- philitic. For though mercury was employ- ed in some of the cases, it was used at such a time, or in such quantity, that it cannot in the least influence our decision as to this point, For instance, in the first case, though mercury was employed for the cure of the primary ulcer, and did apparently contribute to it; yet the secondary symptoms got well without mercury, which, according to the opinions nowprevailingamongsurgeons, is a proof that neither was syphilitic. It may in- deed be supposed that the syphilitic poison may be modified by certain constitutions, and its effects spontaneously disappear ; and some may question if the secondary symptoms were the consequences of the sores or absorption to which I attribute them.

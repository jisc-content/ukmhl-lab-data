85 RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. g 3 concomitant pains have been so much ag- gravated at night as to deprive the patient of rest. The history of the case has rem oved all suspicion of a venereal origin ; while general indisposition, a furred tongue, loss of appetite, and other attendant symptoms, have clearly indicated great disorder of the chylopoietic viscera. By attending to the state of the digestive organs in these cases, the patientâ€™s health is amended; the ge- neral rheumatic pains are diminished; sleep is procured; and the disease has receded almost entirely. After some time has elapsed, the bone may again swell, the swelling may again be checked, and return no more. Perhaps similar diseases may take place in other bones, at times very remote from the first occurrence of the disorder. If mercury be not employed, there are de- cisive circumstances in the history of the ease which proves that it is not syphilitic. Sometimes suppuration takes place, and ex- poses the bone: this occasionally proves a kind of crisis to the disease at that part. But the circumstances of these affections are so variable as to preclude a complete enumer- ation of their symptoms.

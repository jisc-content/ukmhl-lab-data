ON DISEASES 114 CASE XVI. A gentleman between twenty and thirty years of age, residing in the country, had an ulcer in the prepuce, which, to use the words of his surgeon, had more the appear- ance of excoriation than chancre; it was suc- ceeded by a bubo and ulcerated throat. For each of these diseases he used mercury so freely as to convince some of his medical attendants that the disease could not be sy- philitic ; his surgeon said enough to cure twenty syphilitic patients. The ulcers in his whilst it spread on the other. The constitutional symp- toms were speedily cured by a slight mercurial affection, but they broke out again under a severe course of mer- cury. Many constitutional symptoms got well without the use of mercury, and when at last it was employed again on account of the stubborn nature of the nodes, these diseases yielded to a slight, and were aggravated by a severe course of mercury. The disease lastly yielded to an alterative course of mercury, so slight as not mani- festly to affect the constitution, and during which the patient got muscular, fat, and healthy. The subject of this case was a remarkably healthy man, and had before contracted syphilitic diseases, which were regular in their progress and cure. Mercury also affected his constitution in the mode which is considered most de- sirable for the cure of syphilis.

146 ON DISEASES with little advantage. At first when the patientâ€™s apprehensions were considerable, as the alterative course of mercury failed to do good, the dose was increased even so as to affect the mouth, but the disease was so evidently aggravated by it, that the me- dicine was for a time left off, and with manifest advantage. In the autumn of the succeeding year a new disease oc- curred. A large deep ulcer formed in the throat, which had all the characters of sy- philis. It, however, very suddenly ac- quired its largest dimensions, being about an inch in length, and half an inch in breadth. It was situated obliquely between the top of the tonsil and the front of the velum palati. It was very deep. As so little success had attended the alterative course of mercury in the ulcerative disease of the nose, and as the progress of the present ulcer could be noted, no mercury was employed, and in about a month this ulcer was well, and the patient has not since had any relapse; and, from the length of time which has since elapsed, it is highly probable that he never will have any. 12

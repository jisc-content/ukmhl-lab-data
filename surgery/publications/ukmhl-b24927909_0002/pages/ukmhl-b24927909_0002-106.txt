Such infectious matter is likely to produce irri- tability or weakness of the nervous system* and consequent general disorder. The nervous disorder is likely, more especially, to disturb the functions of the digestive organs, and by their re-action to become prolonged and aggravated. In almost every case of pseudo-syphilis a disorder of the di- gestive organs is manifest, and in many, most evident benefit is derived from cor- recting this, as far as we are able.

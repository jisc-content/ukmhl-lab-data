118 ONf DISEASES CASE XVII. A gentleman had a trivial sore upon the prepuce, and being engaged to marry in the course of a few months, he underwent what was considered as a more than adequate course of mercury, for the cure of the disease. After he had married, however, his throat ulcerated. His surgeon hesitated in pro- nouncing it to be syphilitic, and its progress contra-indicated that supposition, for one sore healed and another broke out, or ulcer- ation again ensued in the same place. One of the testes afterwards became considerably enlarged without pain, and sores broke out upon the scrotum, which was much thick- ened, and in the perinasum. Six or more months passed during the progress of the disease to this state, when I was first con- sulted on the case. It was in the spring of the year, and we agreed that he should spend vated by the most powerful effects of mercury. The cases above recited, I therefore deem worthy attention, as they show that diseases resembling syphilis may occur in the nose as well as elsewhere; and that our practice should be regulated by the same principles in treating these, as in other symptoms of venereal diseases.

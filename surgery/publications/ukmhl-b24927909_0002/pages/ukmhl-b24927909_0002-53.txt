RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 4 5 seems to be capable of deciding upon its na- ture. Although the ulcers in these ambi- guous cases generally spread more exten- sively along the surface of the part which they affect, yet this does not constantly hap- pen, as is shown in the eighth case. In this case, however, the induration which sur- rounded the chancre occurred suddenly, and went away as rapidly. The progress there- fore of the two diseases was very dissimilar. * # On the subject of induration surrounding chancres, I think it may be useful to relate the following case, and to mention that I have known similar ones in a less degree: A student in surgery showed me an indurated chancre, for the cure of which he had used a great quantity of mer- cury, which had affected his mouth for a long time, though not severely. The sore so exactly resembled a bad indurated venereal chancre, that I did not hesitate to recommend him to remain at home, and rub in so as to produce a slight salivation. But as no amendment was perceived after a fortnightâ€™s confinement, and under a considerable affection of the mouth, I was induced to en- quire more strictly into the local treatment of the sore, which I found he was constantly irritating by various stimulating applications. He also affirmed that the hardness had several times gone away and returned again. By bathing the part with milk and water, and dressing it only night and morning with mild salve, the hardness quickly abated, and though he desisted from the mercurial course, it soon became perfectly well.

ON DISEASES 180 equally well. Two years have now elapsed, without any necessity for repeating these operations. In this case a disease took place in the prostate gland, without producing any evi- dent enlargement or tenderness of its sub- stance, though it had proceeded to a state of ulceration. The disease seems to have oper- ated on the continuous parts in two direc- tions; backwards upon the bladder, render- ing that organ irritable ; and forwards upon the urethra, causing strictures, which were in some degree organic, though chiefly of a spasmodic nature. It must be allowed, how- ever, that the obstruction of the aperture into the bladder by the discharges from the ulcerated surface contributed in a great de- gree to maintain the irritability of the organ, by impeding the discharge of the urine. This disease was also of a nature that ad- mitted of relief, and the passage of a bougie seemed to effect its cure. It had, however, a tendency to recur, and the use ofâ€™ the bougie lessened the irritability of the part, and arrested the progress of the disease.

ON DISEASES 19(3 also, it may occasionally arise from the irri- tation of the last stricture. Many patients with strictures, who complained much of the sensations at the neck of the bladder, at the commencement of the treatment of their complaint, have asserted, that they felt no unusual sensations when the bougie passed through the prostate, after the strictures had been cured. Yet, though I would admit that a tenderness of the canal of the urethra in the prostate may sometimes arise from its proximity and continuity with the lining of the bladder, or with the last stricture, I think it more frequently exists as an original and independent disease. It has been shown, that it may render the bladder irri- table, and excite contractions in the urethra. Some cases have been adduced, which show that this state may exist, and yet the bladder may not be constantly irritable, but that it lmiy be affected by fits. I have also met with a case where this sensibility existed in an extreme degree, and yet it seemed to have very little influence on the bladder. I have likewise known this irritable state ot the urethra complicated with enlargement of the prostate.

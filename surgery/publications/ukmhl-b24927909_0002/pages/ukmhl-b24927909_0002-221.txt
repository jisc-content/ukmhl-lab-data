On passing a bougie, I found two strictures considerably contracted, and a tender state of the urethra where it passes through the prostate. These dis- eases being relieved, all irritation in the testis ceased, and the enlargement rapidly subsided ; so that in two months it was scarcely larger than the other, and all dis- ease had ceased. This happened without any other local application than a poultice at night, and support by a bandage. Even the poultice at night was soon discontinued. This patient has had no return of disease of the testis, and many years have elapsed since the occurrences which I have been relating.

35 RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. d 2 vitriolated zinc appeared to lessen the irri- tability and contribute to the skin-ring of the sore, which was merely on the surface, not having been attended with any loss of substance. Afterwards the penis being subjected to some accidental irritation, the same kind of soreness spread over the other half of the corona glandis ; but this disease was not ac- companied with so much tenderness as the former one, and got well in less than a month. As soon as it was well, the patient had an ulceration of the velum pendulum palati, round which the cuticle assumed a whitish colour; the ulceration spread across the palate, but it was evident that the part first affected got better, whilst the ulcer be- came worse in the parts last affected. Two or three ulcers took place upon each edge of the tongue, and some on the inside of the lips. At the same time many copper- coloured spots appeared on the face, breast, arms, and lower extremities; they came out in succession, were of an oval shape, about the size of a sixpence, and had a strikingly syphilitic aspect.

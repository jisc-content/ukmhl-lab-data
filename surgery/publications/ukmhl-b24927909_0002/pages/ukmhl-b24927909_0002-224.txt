216 ON DISEASES sensation of heat, irritation, and a strong inclination to make water were felt; the bougie, however, passed into the bladder, and was closely held by the sphincter. The perinseum was then ordered to be bathed night and morning with warm water, and a bread and water poultice to be applied to the testicle, which were done, and at the end of Â» the week, the pain and irritation in the tes- ticle were greatly relieved; the same bougie was then passed, but with greater ease, and the painful sensations which had before been felt on its entering the prostate were much diminished. The warm bathing and poultices were continued, and the same bou- gie passed at the end of the following week with still greater ease and slighter sensations. At the end of the third week the strictures were touched with kali pur., which produced little irritation ; and on the week following a much larger bougie passed with ease; the warm bathing and poultices being continued in the interval. During the three following weeks the large bougie passed with great ease: no irritation was felt after it; and the sensations, whilst it was going through the prostate, were slighter each successive time.

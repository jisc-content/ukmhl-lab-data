PREFACIi. Vll works already mentioned. To Dr. Barkkr, the Curator of the Museum at St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital, he is also indebted for his politeness, and the prompt facilities which he has afforded in obtaining drawings of some preparations there : and, to B. Barton, Esq. for the beauty and great fidelity of his drawings. There is another friend to whose great professional talents and literary acquirements he would fain pay the tribute of respect, were it not for his extreme modesty. In conclusion j the editor begs leave to apologize for any errors, whether of omission or commission: he is at least conscious of having used his best endeavours to render the work worthy of the public confidence, and of the universal fame of its Author.

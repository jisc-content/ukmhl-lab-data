149 ON INJUnUiS 01' THE HEAD. pronouncing' tliat the injury has been trifling; but when the individual has been first seized with vomiting, is incapable of using any muscular power from loss of nervous influence; a total aberration of the mental faculties, with intermittent pulse and breathing, these will be found the diagnostic symptoms of severe injury, and the case a dangerous one. In simple concussion, where the derangement is not so extensive as that just described, and where the patient, upon being spoken to, raises himself, as if awoke from a sound sleep, and where some power of volition still remains, you will find one of the best diagnostic symptoms to be the accelerated action of the pulse upon the patient exerting himself; a man in this state with a pulse at 70, on being raised, or attempting to walk, will have it inordinately quickened, it will instantly beat 130 in a minute; this is a never failing symptom, and where the patient can be made to exert himself at all, will be found a sure characteristic of the disease. There is also in these cases a greater action of the carotids than in health; they beat more violently, though not more quickly, if the patient be at rest; if asked what are the best marked symptoms of concussion, I should say this increased motion of the carotids; the apparent tranquil sleep; the instantaneous relapse to that state, after having been roused; the remarkable excitement of the pulse upon using exertion, and insensibility having immediately followed the injuiy. The diminution of the operations of the mind is often so great in concussion, even where considerable voluntaiy motion remains, that you cannot, even by hallooing as loudly as you are capable, get any other answer from your patient, than ‘ eh! ’ delivered in a gruff under-tone. I have known several very curious circumstances of this kind;—one case was that of a gentleman who had met with an injury of the head,^ by which concussion had been produced every endeavour to get a word from him was ineffectual; yet at one period, when the attendants were all absent, he got out of bed, bolted the door, made water, and returned to bed again, in the same manner as though he had been in perfect health: when the servant went back, he found the dooi fastened; all their knocking" was unavailing" Its effect on the auditory organs.

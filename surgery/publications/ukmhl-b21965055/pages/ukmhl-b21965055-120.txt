I merely mention to you these cases, to put you on your guard : for I have seen breasts removed, which were only chronic abscesses ; and thus, from an ignorance of this circumstance, you might put your patient to a cruel operation, where a small incision would have done. Wnientof In the treatment of acute abscesses, the best medicine you can abscesses. give is the liquor ammoniae acetatis, sulphate of magnesia, and opium ; six oz. of the first, one oz. of the second, and a drachm of the tincture of opium, of which the dose is three or four table- spoonfuls three times a-day.

No stimulating action w'ould do ; the object is topieseive the heat and moisture of the part, and to prevent evaporation: let the part be enveloped in oil-silk, for, by its assist- ance, the heat of a part is piâ€˜eserved, and evaporation prevented.

If an acute abscess seems disposed to go through its different stages without any interruption, the best practice is to leave it undisturbed. Acute abscesses, beginning under aponeurotic fasciae, ought to be opened as early as possible ; the earlier the better. The moment one drop

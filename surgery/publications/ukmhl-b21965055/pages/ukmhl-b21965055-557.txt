Oi' FISTULA IN ANO. 42.1 upon a change in the part itself; but is much more frequently the result of distant visceral complaints, and of a broken state of the constitution. When confined to the part, it arises from obstinate costiveness How produced- and the efforts to discharge the faeces; and the passage of an indurated stool produces inflammation of the muscles and cellular tissue of the rectum. But the opposite state to the above I have several times known produce it; thus, in a severe diarrhoea, which determining large quantities of blood to the rectum, and being accompanied with tenesmus, is followed by inflammation and suppuration at the extremity of the rectum. But the more common cause is disease of the liver, which, preventing the free I'eturn of blood from the intestines, leads to inflammation at the anus, and by influencing the secretions from the intestines, occasions a similar effect.

Often, therefore, before a person perishes from phthisis, he has Connected a fistula in ano; and this is the reason fistula is considered as a phthisis, dangerous disease; although in reality it is not so, but it is the consequence of more important diseases, which destroy life. The surgeon often brings discredit upon himself by operating in these cases in the last stage of phthisis, when no operation ought to be performed, and when it is impossible the disease can be cured; therefore that death, which is the result of pulmonary disease, is falsely attributed to the fistula in ano. The medical treatment of this disease consists in restoring the Medical Ireat- secretionsof the liver and intestinal tube, bysubmurias hydrargyri, or pil: hyd: at night, and infus: gentianse compositum, with soda andj-hubarb, twice in the day; and if there be any pulmonary or pectoral disease, its treatment must precede, and its cure be performed, before any active local means of treatment be had recourse to. .The strength of the patient must also be restored

ON lllUITATION. 13 ingâ€™ to ascertain tlie causes of diseased sympathetic actions, as the removal of those defects will depend on the cure of their causes. If the causes be undiscovered, the effects are likely to continue in spite of every means that you may employ. The constitutional or general effects of irritation are frequently Constitutional 1 symptoms. produced by the most trivial local cause. A person, on having a bougie passed into the urethra for the first time, feels faint, be- comes sick, looks pale, and, unless you prevent it, will fall on the ground. On placing him in the recumbent posture, with his head a little lower than his body, and as soon as the blood freely enters the brain, all his functions are restored; but constitutional irrita- tion frequently comes on in the evening, which, however, soon ceases.

Thus, in constitutional irrita- tion, whether from injury or disease, every part of the system is affected by it; and this effect appears to be produced in the follow-

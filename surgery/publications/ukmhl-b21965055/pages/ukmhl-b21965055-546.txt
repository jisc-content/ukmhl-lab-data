410 ON THE PUNCTURE ABOVE THE PUBES. Operation. the abdominal parietes above the pubes to the fundus of the bladder; and is continued to the back of the bladder, near to the prostate gland, and is then reflected to the fore part of the rectum. Thus the cervix of the bladder and its fore part above and behind the pubes, also the posterior and inferior part behind the prostate gland as far as the entrance of the ureters, are devoid of peritoneal covering. or THE PUNCTURE ABOVE THE PUBES. When the bladder becomes excessively distended, its fundus rises towards the umbilicus, and carries with it the peritoneum, so that a considerable space is left above the pubes uncovered by this membrane, at which place a trocar may be easily introduced, without danger of wounding it. This space is covered by the linea alba, in the centre, and at the sides by the pyramidales and recti muscles, the bladder being attached beneath by cellular tissue. The operation requires the following attentions. First, The patient is to be placed on a table, in the horizontal position, with his knees a little elevated. Secondly, The hair is to be removed from the pubes. Thirdly, An incision, one inch in length, is to be made through the integument immediately above the pubes, in the direction of the linea alba. Fourthly, A trocar and canula, of sufficient length, are passed through the opening in the skin, and then thrust through the linea alba, cellular tissue, and fore part of the bladder into its caAuty. Fifthly, The direction of the trocar should be to the basis of the sacrum, that is,, a little upwards, and not directly doAvnvTirds in a perpenkular line, as it may then pass between the bladder and pubes; and even if the instrument enters the bladder, as the organ contracts it slips from the canula. Sixthly, The trocar is to be withdrawn to allow the urine to escape through the canula.

SrEJlMATlC CORD, AND PARTS ADJACENT. 293 diseased; several of the lobes of the vasa efferentia being converted into a yellowish brown solid structure. In apre the seminiferous tubes become small; they appear yellow Seminiferous instead of red, from their having less arterial blood; and it oiten happens that a considerable number of them become cords instead of tubes, assuming a ligamentous appearance. A varicose state of the less testis is frequent in age. The testis does not in general become absorbed, if it be partially diseased, although its functions may be interrupted,^ even to complete obstruction of semen. In 1823, I made the following experiment on a dog. I divided Experiments, the vas deferens upon one side, and the spermatic artery and vein on the other. The testis upon that side on which the artery and vein were divided, gangrened, and sloughed away. The testis on the side upon which the duct was divided, became somewhat larger than natural. I kept the dog for six years; during that time he was twice seen in coitu, but the female did not produce. This was in 1827. In 1829, I killed him, and found the vas deferens below the division excessively enlarged and full of semen, and entirely stopped, with some separation of its extremities; but it was open from the place of division to the urethra, (see Plate.) The testis sometimes becomes wasted, of which I have given a Plate; and in confirmation of Mr. Hunterâ€™s opinion of the use of the vesicula seminalis, the vesiciila on that side was certainly as large as on the other, (see Plate.) The wasting of one testis at an early period does not prevent the person in after-life having children. Mr. H , a gentleman in the neighbourhood of Lynn, in Case. Norfolk, consulted me of a disease in his bladder; and upon examining him, I found his left testis absorbed, so that nothing remained but a small body not larger than a horse-bean. His testis wasted at 23 years, from absorption succeeding inflammation. He

140 TREATMENT OF GANGRENE. Gangrene from accident. Case. Case. but the infection spread in the nose and foot, wliich, before the operation, were slightly gangrenous: then, gentlemen, it is proper to consider that amputation should never be performed till the constitution is in a sound state, and healthy granulations have appeared. But with respect to gangrene from defective action or accident— When called to a person labouring under gangrene, arising from accident or pressure on some important vessel, amputation may be performed without the least hesitation.

A man was brought to Guy’s, from Woolwich, with popliteal aneurism: the aneurism had acquired a great size; there was a gangrenous state of the limb below, so that it was thought there was no chance of saving his life by tying the artery; therefore amputation was performed. Before the operation the pulse was from 120 to 130. In the evening, after the removal of the limb, I sent Mr. Callaway, who was my apprentice at that time, to see how the patient was doing; he found that the pulse had fallen to 90; and no stump that ever came under my care turned out more favourably. Thus, instead of increasing the irritability of the constitution, the source of the irritation being removed, the health of the patient became improved. ON GANGRENE IN OLD PERSONS. Cause of gangrene.

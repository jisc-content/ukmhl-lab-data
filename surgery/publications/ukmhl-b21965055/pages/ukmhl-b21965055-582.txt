But ascites is frequently the effect of disease in the chest, of water accumulated in the cavities of the pleura, of-water in the pericardium, or of some organic change in the heart, interrupting the action of the source of the circulation: the blood therefore accumulating in the right side of the heart and in the veins returning the blood to the right auricle, leads to the production of water in the abdomen, and of a general anasarcous state. It has been a question whether dropsy arises from an increased secretion of the blood-vessels, or from an absolute diminished action of the absorbent vessels. It is generally the former I have no doubt, for reasons which I have already given, when speaking of hydrocele. OF THE TREATMENT OF ASCITES. The disposition to this disease may be prevented, its progress, when it has begun, may be retarded, and large accumulations of fluid may be removed by medical treatment, and by external applications. If the disease originate in a complaint of the liver,. the restoration of its secretions, and an action upon the alimentary canal by mercury, combined with other purgative remedies, become the best means of preventing effusion. If the complaint originate from local disease in some of the other viscera, as in the spleen, or omentum, the secretions must be increased in a similar manner, and blisters should be applied, and for some time continued, on the abdomen. If water has already begun to form, the best medicines, as far as I know, are the submurias hydrarg: gr: jss. pulv: gambogim gr: ss. scillae gr: iij. in the form of a pill, taken every night: and spir: aether: nitric: 5ss. to 5j. oxym: hydrarg: gr. f. tiiict: digital: gutt. xv. with some camphor mixture, twice or three times in the day.

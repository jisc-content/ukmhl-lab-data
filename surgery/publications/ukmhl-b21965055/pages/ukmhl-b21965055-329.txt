OF THE RETE. 271 Eacli tubulus begins from one of tbe canals which form the rete; ad, passing- through a small hole in the mediastinum testis, it icomes excessively convoluted, and forms a conical or pyriform ody, the basis of which is turned to the inner side of the tunica buginea, and the convolutions are placed nearly at right angles ith the long axis of the tubulus. Each tuhulus may be unravelled, hen it is found to be composed of a long, single, and convoluted essel, the convolutions disposed nearly in parallel lines, and nearly ■ansversely to the long axis of the lobe. With these tubuli, thrown into larger and smaller lobes, and apported by ligaments from the mediastinum, is the cavity of the mica albuginea filled. The blood-vessels'distributed upon the lobes re as follows:—First, the spermatic ao'tery passes in two large ranches on the opposite side of the testis to the epididymis; and •etween the outer and inner layer of the tunica albuginea, they aie ontinued upon the inner coat towards the anterior and inferior edge tf the testis. There they form an arch of communication, from vhich vessels pass upwards and backwards upon the membranes ivhich cover the lobes of the tubuli; and when they have reached :wo-thirds of the way to the mediastinum, they divide into two aranches, which turn back on each side towards the anterior edge, ind supply the membrane abundantly with vessels. The smaller .obes receive a little vessel at each extremity. The principal branches of the spermatic veins enter the testis in a different manner to the arteries; a few pass on each side upon the surface of the lobes, but the greater number descend upon the mediastinum, and are continued upon the ligaments of the testis, between the larger lobes, to the anterior edge, where they become inverted, to be distributed upon the extremities of the larger lobes ; and they also meet some small veins which pass in at the anterior- edge, and which are distributed upon the extremities of the lobes. OF THE RETE. By the term Rete, is meant a set of canals which receive the

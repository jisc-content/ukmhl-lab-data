ox THE DESCENT OF THE TESTIS. 289 accompanied with violent pain, and only relieved by the hot bath and by fomentation. The tunica vaginalis is generally closed at birth; but it often is open on one side and sometimes on both. This opening is sometimes so small as to admit serum only to descend into it, and then a congenital hydrocele is produced. A truss applied in infancy, by closing the canal, cures the disease; the water being absorbed when the tunica vaginalis is closed. The opening of the tunica vaginalis is sometimes partially closed, and produces hydrocele of the spermatic cord; but it is also the result of serous cysts forming in the cord, more especially just above the testis. The opening of the tunica vaginalis in some instances remains small until the adult age, and it then becomes suddenly dilated by a protrusion of intestine, producing hernia congenita; and when the surgeon in the operation discovers 'its nature, the patient assures hirh he never had hernia until a few days before. This I have several times known. (See Plate.) More frequently the tunica vaginalis, when unclosed, admits protrusion of the intestine in childhood, in contact with the testis, producing hernia congenita. In those cases in which the testicle has not descended at birth, it often happens that a hernia becomes the means of its descent; and such hernia should remain without a truss being applied, until it has brought down the testis into the scrotum. A testis late in its descent, and produced by hernia, is often lessened in its bulk ; but the testis on the other side, with this diminished organ, is sufficient for the procreation of children. The tunica vaginalis is sometimes closed by a film of adhesion; which, becoming elongated by intestinal protrusion, forms a sac, in the mouth of which the intestine has been strangulated; and the patient dies, if unrelieved by an operation. u

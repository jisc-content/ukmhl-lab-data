dissection. .36.5 the urine is loaded with mucus, and sometimes precipitates a white sediment, composed of flakes of adhesive matter, thrown out by the mucous membrane of the bladder, when it has become inflamed. This state is often attended with rigors, succeeded by heat, and other' symptoms of intermittent fever, and matter is sometimes discharg'ed with the urine. The mucous membrane of the bladder mejn- becomes ulcerated when a stone has existed long ; the patient loses brane nlce- his health; is incapable of getting sufiicient rest; and thus he is destroyed by the disease. A person labouring under this complaint walks with excessive care ; he does not raise his feet much from the ground, to prevent any shock to the body, which would create pain, and occasion spasmodic action of the bladder; he also lies down with great caution, as the sudden change of posture might alter the position of the stone, and produce irritation. DISSECTION. In examining persons who die with a stone in the bladder, the mucous coat, mucous membrane appears loaded with blood, it is thickened, and highly villous. Its muscular coat is much increased, and the Muscular coat, capacity of the bladder lessened. Numerous sacculi are some- gacculi. times formed, the mucous membrane being forced between some of the muscular fibres, and, in these bags, stones are wholly or partially received. We have a preparation in the Museum showing this state of the bladder, with stones lodged in these sacculi. I have seen ulceration of the mucous membrane, and we have an Ulceration of example of stones ulcerating the basis of the prostate, and making their way into the urethra. We have also another very curious specimen, in which the upper Bladder con- part of the bladder had contracted around the stone, whilst the lower part is in the natural state. A stone is often found with an enlarged state of the prostate

276 OF THE VAS HEFEUENS, OR DUCTUS SPERMATICUS. Cauda. Bodj% Spermatic duct. band of epididymis passes, which receives a vessel from each lobe of the vasa efferentia. OF THE CAUDA EPIDIDYMIS. Its cauda terminates in the vas deferens, the tube of which is larger and less convoluted than that of the epididymis; and this is their chief distinction. But in injecting the testicle, the quick- silver is with difficulty made to pass from the vas deferens into the epididymis, in consequence of the sudden turn the tube here makes, and from its being bound down by cords proceeding from the cremaster muscle. OF THE BODY OF THE EPIDIDYMIS. The body of the epydidymis is entirely composed of the convolutions of a single seminal tube thrown into lobes; and the convolutions- pass in parallel lines from edge to edge. This part is smaller than the head of the crescent. That it is composed of a single tube, is not only shewn by its being capable of being entirely unravelled after maceration; but to the learner it is easily demonstrated by unravelling it at any one part. It is subject to some varieties. First, I have seen it naturally unravelled in its centre, to the extent of three-quarters of an inch; and, secondly, it very frequently sends forth an additional vas deferens, from one to three inches in length, along the spermatic cord; and I have a preparation of three of these in the same testicle, each terminating in a blind extremity. OF THE VAS DEFERENS, OR DUCTUS SPERMATICUS. This duct begins from the cauda epididymis, and it terminates in the duct of the vesicula seminalis, the combined vessels opening at the veru montanum in the prostatic part of the urethra. At its beginning from the epididymis it is doubled upon that body, Its course.

ON INri,AMMATION. 28 Ophthalmic and mammary inflammation. Testes. Bladder. Cause of in- flammation. parts are more frequently attacked by it than the breasts of young’ women. It produces such a degree of tenderness that they cannot bear the slightest pressure, and their stays consequently occasion great inconvenience—the pain extends to the shoulder, down the arm, and even to the elbow, at the same time producing constitu- tional irritation. To cure these pains and general derangement, such medicines must be given as will influence the secretions, but more particularly those of the uterus. The irritable inflammation frequently attacks the testicles, and renders them exceedingly sensitive, the slightest pressure causing very great pain. There is in these cases little or no alteration of size; if any difference, the affected one is the smallest. In three instances I have been obliged to remove testicles for this disease.

The grand difference in the tw'o cases is this: the irritable bladder is most painful Avhen the organ is full; the bladder that , contains a stone, when ii is evipty. Upon dis- section, the inner coat of an irritable bladder has been seen the colour of red A’^elvet. I have known this irritable inflammation attack the rectum, and produce excessiA^e suffering, AA^hich Avas relieved by large doses of soda, rhubarb, and the compound poAvder of ipecacuanha. Inflammation sometimes arises from debility, and this state is frequently seen in the loAver extremities of old persons, in Avhom the blood returns to the heart Avith difficulty. From this Aveakened power, the arteries are called upon for unusual exertion, and inflam-

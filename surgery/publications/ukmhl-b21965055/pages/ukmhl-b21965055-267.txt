229 ON THE TYING OF AUTERIE3. was exceedingly reduced from loss of blood. Under these ciicum- stances, T thought myself justified in performing the operation of tying the aorta; for this step I have been greatly abused, but abuse, gentlemen, does no injuiy; it shows a malicious and bad disposition on the part of those from whom it proceeds, and on a man possess- ing the mens conscict vecti it will have no effect, unless he be destitute of common sense. I was situated as I have just described, when I tied the aorta ; I knew that the aorta had been obliterated within the chest, and that the circulation had been carried on by the intercostal arteries going from above to just below the spot where the aorta was obliterated : the insides of the ribs are covered with numerous vessels. A gentleman of Dublin had a prepaiation, irT which the aorta had been obliterated in the abdomen; and in this case the circulation was carried on by the lumbar arteries going from above to below the part where the vessel was obliterated; I had not the least doubt but that if the aorta was obliterated, anastomosing vessels would carry on the circulation, on the same principle as in any other part of the body ; the greatest danger is not from gangrene when the ligature is applied on the aorta, nor is any thing to be apprehended, as far as regards the canying on of the circulation ; but the danger consists in including the nerves, as I will presently show you. Here is a specimen of a dog (pointing to one on the table), in which the aorta has been tied, and the circulation was carried on by the lumbar arteries; it is a very easy operation on the dog, and any one may perform it. I will tell you how you should do it; you must make an incision on the side of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, cut through the muscles and peritoneum, and then you may easily carry the aneurismal needle under the vessel, and bring it out of the wound, in order that you may see that you have not included the aortic plexus: if this be secured in the ligature, a paralytic affection of the lower extremities will be produced: now I wish particularly to state this, as I believe it to be entirely new, and that nothing new has been said on this Experiments on dogs.

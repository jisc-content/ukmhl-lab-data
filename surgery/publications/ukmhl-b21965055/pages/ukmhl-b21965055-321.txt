OF THE TUNICA ALBUGINEA TESTIS. 269 inelastic, resembling- the sclerotic coat of the eye, and external portion of the dura mater; and like other tendinous structures, it is endowed with but little vascularity. It is strong- and inelastic, to protect the tender tubular substance of the testis from violence ; for the most severe blow or pressure rarely injures it, whilst suspended in its natural situation; and although extravasations of blood into the tunica vaginalis are not uncommon, yet the testis generally escapes any severe injui-y; as blows inflicted upon the eye produce great ecchymosis in its neighbourhood, yet how rarely is the eye itself ruptured. The inner coat or layer of the tunica albuginea I should call the tunica vasculosa; for in it the spermatic artery ramifies. It is easily separated by dissection from the outer layer, excepting at the anterior edge of the testis, where some of the internal ligamentous cords are fixed; but it may be entirely separated from the outer layer of the tunica albuginea, so as to form a separate preparation, enclosing the tubuli, and leaving the outer layer of the tunic with the spematic cord. This tunica vasculosa is easily demonstrated, by filling the arteries and veins with fine injection: the testis is then cut open, and the tubuli removed, when this membrane is seen highly vascular on the inner part of the tunica albuginea. Whilst the outer layer bears a strong resemblance to the dura mater—like it being tendinous and inelastic, and like it forming processes internally—the inner membrane of the tunica albuginea resembles the pia mater, being reflected inwards on the lobes of the testis, and forming a bed, on which the branches of the spermatic artery ramify, and supplying with vessels the membranes which envelope the tubuli. Tbe arteries which supply the tunica vasculosa pass between this coat and the proper tunica albuginea before they divide into minute branches, to supply the membrane which is reflected inwards. Some branches of the spermatic veins also ramify upon the surface of this membrane; but the greater number pass, upon the ligamen- tous cords, into the glandular substance of the interior of the testis, and upon this membrane absorbent vessels are also found.

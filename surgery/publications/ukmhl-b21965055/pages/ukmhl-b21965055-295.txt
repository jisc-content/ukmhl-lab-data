ox THE CURE OF HYDROCELE. 253 that after the incision had been made, a portion of the tunica vag’inalis should be cut out; but this operation is followed by high constitutional irritation; it is true that it sometimes effects a cuie by preventing the return of the hydrocele, but it also does it by killing the patient; in fact, the very last time that I saw this operation performed, a violent inflammation and sloughing of the scrotum ensued; why, gentlemen, any one rather than undergo such an operation, would submit to have a hydrocele all his life ; the mode of relief is too cruel for so trifling an inconvenience. The next mode is that of introducing a tent into the tunica By tent or vaginalis ; a small incision is made through the tunica vaginalis and scrotum, and a piece of lint or sponge is introduced, so as to prevent the sudden escape of the water; the water gradually issues out, during which time adhesion and granulation often takes place; but this sometimes fails. Caustic and setons were formerly very much used, two remedies, about which there was as much bandying and quarrelling among the members of the profession as if the world were at stake on the issue—two remedies, which now are not only generally abandoned, but which I should be ashamed to own ever having used; such is the folly of quarrelling in our profession; as for arguments on subjects which are only to be settled by observation, they are of no use; and persons who argue thus d priori, without a knowledge of facts, which alone ought to form the basis of argument in our profession, want that judgment wdiich conducts a a man best through life; but many were the advocates of caustic as a cure for hydrocele; and the way it was used was by taking the potassa fusa, and applying- it to the fore part of the scrotum, till an eschar, of the size of a sixpence, is formed, which produces an irritation to the extent of half an inch, or three quarters of an inch around, and then the eschar so produced destroys the skin and tunica vaginalis; as soon as the inflammation arises, the w'ater escapes, then the parts sometimes become glued together, and granulations arise. Well, gentlemen, this remedy soon fell into disrepute; 1st, on account of its uncertainty ; 2dly, because it was dangerous to life; here is a specimen (pointing to one on the table),.

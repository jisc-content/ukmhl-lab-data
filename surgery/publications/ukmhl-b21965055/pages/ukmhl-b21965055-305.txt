DARTOS. 263 that when the scrotum is diseased, the irritation is extended to the inguinal glands. The nerves of the scrotum are derived from three sources. First, from a lumbar scrotal nerve, which arises from the first Nerves of the and second lumbar nerves. It passes over the quadratus lumborum, to send branches to the abdominal muscles and to the skin. It penetrates the internal oblique muscle on the inner side of the spinous process of the ilium, and over Poupart’s ligament. It takes its course between the tendon of the external oblique and the internal oblique muscles, and with the spennatic cord penetrates the external abdominal ring, and directly divides into numerous branches, which supply the skin of the groin, the scrotum, and skin of the root of the penis. Secondly, the external spermatic nerve, which passes from the second lumbar nerve, and is distributed to the cremaster, and to the cellular tissue of the scrotum. It also sends a branch under Poupart’s ligament to the skin of the groin, and of the inner and upper part of the thigh. The perineal nerve, or pudendus inferior, accompanies the perineal artery, passes between the accelerator urinee and erector penis, and divides into two sets of branches :—the first passes to the skin of the scrotum laterally; the other set is continued to the septum scroti, and to the centre of the fore-part of the scrotum: it also gives branches to the rectum, sphincter ani, transversus perinsei, and accelerator urinse. DARTOS. On the inner side of the integuments of the scrotum a muscle is Dartos. supposed to exist, which is called the dartos, and to which the motions of this part have been attributed; but it exists only in the imagination of the anatomist: for it is clear that the motions of the scrotum are not the result of muscular action; they are vermicular, gradual, and not sudden contractions; they are not voluntary; they

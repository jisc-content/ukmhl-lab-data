To the second question the reply is made with more difficulty. A large proportion of cases return ; but fewer than formerly, if the patient, immediately after recovering from the operation, undergoes an alterative course of medicine. The only mode It may be truly said, in the present state of our knowledge, the of relief. operation furnishes the only hope of preventing the disease from proving destructive, with the exception of very advanced age, in which it makes little inroad on the constitution, and little progress Parts to be removed.

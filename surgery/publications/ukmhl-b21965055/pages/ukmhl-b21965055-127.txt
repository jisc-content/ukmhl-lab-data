ON GRANULATION. 89 irritation attending the opening of abscesses, takes a nanow and partial view of the case ; for the cause of the irritation is as follows: if a wound be made into any cavity of the body, be it an abscess or a natural cavity, soon after the vessels of the part are divided, inflammation arises to heal the wound, whether it be exposed to the air or not. If it heal by adhesion, the influence is slight, and directly terminates; but if the adhesive inflammation be insuffi- cient or imperfect, then a suppurative inflammation follows, and granulations arise, which process produces violent influence both upon the part and constitution. Therefore, the cause is, the division of the blood-vessels, and not the presence of air; and its degree depends upon the ease or difficulty with which the injuiy is repaired. [After the lecture, the stomach of a dog which had died of hydro- phobia was exhibited to the class. The oesophagus was inflamed, and the internal surface itself veiy red; there were also deposits of coagulated blood between the mucous and muscular coats, an appearance which. Sir Astley said, had always been observed in dogs that had died of this complaint. The animal had unfortu- nately bitten four persons, who were under medical treatment.] LECTURE XI. ON GRANULATION, I HAVE endeavoured to describe to you the first mode in which the Xwo modes of union of wounds, and the mode of filling up cavities is effected, namely, by the process of adhesion. I shall now proceed to con- sider the other mode of union between divided parts of the body, namely. Granulation; thus the two processes which nature institutes for the purpose of filling up the cavities of the body for the cure of wounds are adhesion and granulation. Jf you arc asked for a definition of the term granulation, you will Definilion.

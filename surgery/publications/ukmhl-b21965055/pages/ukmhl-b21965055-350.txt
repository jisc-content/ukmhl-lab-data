PLATE V. (continued.) Fig-.,,4, (continued.') c c, transversalis muscle arising from Poupart’s ligament, and passing around the spermatic cord at the internal ring, so that the fibres of this muscle appear behind as well as befoi-e the spermatic cord, and thus the inguinal canal is rendered a muscular canal, d, the cremaster muscle, arising from Poupart’s ligament, between the internal oblique and transverse muscles, and' receiving fibres from the transversalis behind the cord. e e, rectus muscle. f, its sheath from the internal oblique and transverse musples. g, the superficial fascia of the cord. h h, spermatic cord. i, internal ring. k, external ring. Fig. 5. Internal view of the inguinal canal. a a, Poupart’s ligament, b, internal oblique muscle. c, transversalis muscle. d, rectus. e, spermatic cord. f, internal portion of the fascia transversalis with the trans- versalis'muscle passing upon it, to be fixed in Poupart’s ligament. g, muscular fibres seen through the fascia. h, fascia transversalis, and transversalis muscle, forming the inner portion of the inguinal canal, above which is seen the linea semilunai-is, i, the origin of the transversalis muscle from Poupart’s lio-ament, and the manner in which it is twisted round upon the fascia transversalis, to be inserted into it, and into Poupart’s ligament.

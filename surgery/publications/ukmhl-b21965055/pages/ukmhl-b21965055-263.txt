But this operation is not to be performed when the aneurism in these arteries is near the foot; I have not seen an aneurism of the posterior tibial behind the inner malleolus, but I have of the anterior tibial on the front of the foot. I saw Mr. H. Cline, in an aneurism of the anterior tibial, cut down on the tumour, and apply a ligature just above it, but it did not succeed. In these aneurisms, you must make an incision on the sac, and apply a ligature* both above and below it. The femoral artery sometimes forms an aneurism just opposite, the hip joint and below Poupart’s ligament. I have also aneurism, seen it at the origin of the arteria profunda; but if the aneuiism be placed any where betw-een the g-roin and the middle of the thigh, it would be better to tie the external iliac artery. LECTURE XXII. ON THE TYING OF ARTERIES. We are, this evening, gentlemen, to consider the subject of the taking up of the arteries, in the different parts of the body, for aneurism. THE APPLICATION OF A LIGATURE ON THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. It is not at all an uncommon occurrence to meet with an aneurism xhe operation of the femoral artery just below Poupart’s ligament, of which here described, is a specimen (pointing to one on the table), exactly similar to the aneurisms which occur in the ham. Now, with respect to recurring to the operation in this complaint, I have performed it in nine different instances for aneurism of the femoral artery: one of those persons was a surgeon, who has since married, and is extremely well. The mode in which the operation is performed is as follows:— Q

ON ANEURISM OE THE AORTA. 202 aneurisms attack several parts at the same time. This 1 know, that a man came into this (St. Thomas’s) hospital, with popliteal aneurism: and the operation was about to be performed, when, on account of a pain in the abdomen, it was postponed. Before the next operating day he had died suddenly, and, on examination, an aneurism w^s found between the two emulgent arteries. Well, then, before you operate for aneurism, see whether there be pain and pulsation in any other part. LECTURE XX. ANEURISM OF THE ARCH OF THE AORTA. Absorption produced. Case. When an aneurism takes place between the heart and curvature of the aorta, you find, after a time, from the pressure of the aneurismal bag, the cartilages of the ribs become absorbed, as in the specimen before me (pointing to one on the table), where the cartilages of three of the ribs, and a portion of the sternum, have been absorbed; when the aneurism presses on the lungs, dyspnoea comes on, together with cough, and the complaint is obscure, but at last the fulness on the right side, and the pulsation to be felt by the pressure of the hand on the intercostal spaces, will enable you to distinguish this disease; then the ribs become absorbed, the aneurism presses against the pectoral muscle, absorption reaches the skin, and the sac bursts by the inflammation of the skin, the destruction of the life of the pai’t, and the separation of the eschar. I will mention to you a case, which shows how life may be prolonged sometimes by the formation of an artificial sac: a female in the other hospital had an aneurism of the ascending aorta; the skin had become inflamed, the eschar was separating, and a small quantity of blood was discharged; a clot of blood plugged up the orifice of the opening; pieces of lint were applied, over which was put some adhesive plaster, and lastly a bandage. She lived twenty-seven days afterwards ; the opening of the wound.

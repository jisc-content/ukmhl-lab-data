Let me observe, that whether you perform the operation for the palliative or curative treatment, withdraw the trocar the instant you believe that the canula is w’ithin the tunica vaginalis ; and once having the trocar in, take care to keep it there until the operation be concluded; and the most effectual way to do this is by grasping the tumour at the posterior part, so as to keep it tense wLere the trocar entered.

In some it will be necessary once a month; in others, once in three months ; but, generally speaking, the usual time is every six months. Insignificant as this operation appears, it has been known to Not always cause the destmction of life. Two instances are within my own knowledge. One of the cases was operated upon by Mr. Green, who resides a few miles from town, and the other by myself. Mr. Green’s case was published in the journals, therefore I need not scruple to mention it; but Mr. Green possesses too much manliness to regard a notice of an unsuccessful case, and it must be a mean despicable mind that would. The case is as follows :—An elderly Case, man applied to Mr. Green with a hydrocele, which he a few days

319 OPEUATION OF CASTRATION. The next step of the operation consists in raising the spermatic cord, and in passing a curved needle, armed with a ligature, nearly through its centre, just below the abdominal ring; the ligature is then to be held by an assistant, which prevents the retraction of the cord into the ring, by the contraction of the cremaster muscle. The cord is then completely divided, and the surgeon drawing by it the testicle towards him, separates the cellular tissue between it and the scrotum, and thus detaches it from the surrounding parts. Sometimes, from inflammation, the testicle adheres to the scrotum, in which case it is best to remove a portion of the latter, rather than to make a tedious and painful dissection in separating these parts. When the testicle is removed, the spermatic artery is sought for in the anterior part of the cord, and, when found, is to be secured by a ligature; next, an artery which accompanies the vas deferens, is in like manner to be tied, taking care to exclude the vas deferens from the ligature; after this, the thread which had been passed through the cord, to prevent its retraction, is with- drawn. Any vessels in the scrotum which bleed must be taken up. The coagulated blood is then removed from the scrotum, and two sutures are then put into it to bring the edges of the wound toge- ther; one just over the end of the cord, and the other midway between it and the bottom of the incision; lint is to be laid over the wound, and it is best at first not to apply any plaster. The part is to be supported by a handkerchief, or T bandage. The ligatures separate in about eight days, and in three weeks the wound will probably be healed. The cruel practice of tying the whole cord with a broad ligature is now properly abandoned by every good surgeon.

50 ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. Mode em- ployed. Case. Effects of in- flammation on the blood. friction accelerates circulation and absorption; and the way in winch Mr. Grosvenor recommended it to be done was, by applying both hands to the joints, at the same time alternately moving them up and down. The late Mr. Hey, of Leeds, a man whose mind was free from every paltry prejudice, most eminent in his profession, and ever anxious for truth, had a son who met with a serious injury to his ankle-joint; after trying all he could to relieve it, he sent him to Ml. Grosvenor ; aud under his care, by the judicious application of fiiction, the actions of the joint were completely restored. In cases of violence done to the joints, when the inflammation has been subdued, which it will be in a month or six weeks, friction and motion are very useful: but in chronic diseases of joints, many months of rest will often be required, before inflammation has sufficiently subsided to allow of friction and motion being safely used to prevent anchylosis. LECTURE VII. ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. For a knowledge of this process we are indebted to that bright luminaiy of our profession, the late Mr. John Hunter, a man who was abused, reviled, and laughed at, when living, by the very per- sons who, now that they cannot any longer injure him, are ever loading his name with every species of commendation and praise. Adhesive inflammation is the process by which divided parts become united. Inflammation has a disposition to separate the blood into more parts than usually occur when drawn from a person in health. In health, it merely separates into serum and red particles; but, when in a state of inflammation, if, after being drawn, it be allowed to remain undisturbed, it will separate into serum, red particles, and fibrin. The red particles, together with some fibrin, ivill be found at the bottom of the vessel; the fibrin immediately on the top of

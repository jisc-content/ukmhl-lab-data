mflEASKS OF TIIF. TESTICLE. 260 Hydrocele of the spermatic cord. Mistaken for hernia. Treatment. but very little of the fluid came out. Violent inflammation of the scrotum ensued, which went on to gangrene, and the patient died. Dr. Farmer recently met with a similar case, in which sloughing was brought on from the fluid being injected into the cellular tissue, and the result was the destruction of life. Great care, therefore, should be taken to prevent the fluid from escaping by the side of the canula. I shall conclude this lecture with a few observations on hydrocele of the spermatic cord. This disease may be defined as a collection of water in the spermatic cord, but it is necessary that you should know the situation in which the water is collected. The part at which hydrocele of the spermatic cord takes place is in the tunica vaginalis, between the testicle and the abdominal ring, sometimes extending above the ring, and on that account it is often mistaken for inguinal hernia. By pressing your finger along the parts until you have passed the abdominal ring, you may judge of the nature of the tumour by its blue and semi-transparent appearance, by its being entirely unattended with pain, and by its not running into the abdomen like inguinal hernia. The best mode of treating this disease is to make an incision in the tumour, for injection would, in this situation, be difficult and dangerous 5 to introduce your finger into the sac, so as to ascertain that there is no communication with the abdomen, and then introduce a small quantity of flour to promote a slight internal irritation. In this manner, the cure of hydrocele of the spermatic cord may be readily effected. LECTURE XXV. DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE. Before we proceed to the morbid structures of the testes, it may not be unacceptable to give the anatomy of those parts in their healthy state, and in order the more effectually to facilitate that

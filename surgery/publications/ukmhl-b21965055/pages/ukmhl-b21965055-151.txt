OJf ULCERS. 113 Sometimes in these cases, for the purpose of exciting' the ad- hesive inflammation, injections are used. Now, which is the best? In my opinion, tinctura lyttae: it readily produces inflammation ; adhesive matter is thrown out; you take care to keep the sides of the sinus in contact; and by these means the parts will permanently coalesce. Sinuses of the rectum, however, are seldom cured with- out an operation ; indeed, I have met with but two such cases ; one was that of a gentleman who came from the north of England ; he had been annoyed by a fistula on each side of the anus, one of which was operated upon by the late celebrated Mr. Hey, of Leeds. He was cured on that side by the operation; but as it was attended with great loss of blood, the patient was too much frightened to be cut again, and came to town for my advice. I examined him, and finding that there was considerable space between the anus and fistula, I advised him not to submit to the operation, and said that I would try to relieve him without it. I first injected port wine and water: this did not answer—it was not sufficiently powerful. I therefore threw in port wine alone, a,nd succeeded in obliterating the canal. I was fortunate in this instance; for I can assure you that fistula in ano is seldom, very seldom, completely cured without an operation. When you do not succeed by injection, you may employ the caustic bougie. Still pressure will be necessary; and it is quite impossible that you can succeed without it. When the fistula is veiy deep, it may be divided into two; or a seton may be introduced, and kept in for a fortnight or three Aveeks, with a view of stimulating the parts for the purpose of filling the cavity with granulations.

Ulcers are frequently formed for the purpose of allowing the dis- Stimulants employed. Extraneous bodies.

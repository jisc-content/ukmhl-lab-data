OF AMPUTATION OF THE PENIS. 416 Difliculty ob- viated. Little danger in this opera- tion. Puncture rare' ly necessary. Different modes. Above the pubes the best. When neces- sary. Disease com- mences. With respect to the difficulty of the operation, I would say to him who finds any, pass a catheter or staff, to the stricture, and, directed by its point in making the incision, carry it an inch behind, and in a line with the point of such director, and the difficulty will vanish. The state of the urethra in stricture is very different to that which exists with fistula in perineo: in the former case it is large behind the obstruction, in the latter it is contracted and very difficult to find. By the mode I have advised, the danger of retention of urine is almost entirely dissipated, for opening of the urethra will be rarely followed by fatal effects. OF RETENTION OF URINE IN THE FEMALE. The puncture of the bladder is rarely required in the female; and when it becomes necessary, the surgeon can hardly hesitate in his choice of the mode he shall adopt. It might be performed through the vagina, or it might be executed by the side of the meatus between it and the branch of the pubes in some cases; but the former would probably cause a fistulous orifice, by which the urine would constantly irritate the vagina, and the latter would for some causes of retention be impracticable. The operation above the pubes appears to be, in all respects, preferable to any other; the steps of it are the same as those in the male, and therefore there is no necessity for my again describing it. OF AMPUT.ATION OF THE PENIS. This operation is occasionally required for a cancerous state of the part. The disease, which renders the operation necessary, commences sometimes upon the prepuce and sometimes upon the glans. First, When seated upon the prepuce, it begins on a pimple, In the prepuce.

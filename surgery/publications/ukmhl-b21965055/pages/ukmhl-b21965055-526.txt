390 or THE HIGH OPERATION., OR THAT ABOVE THE PUBES, by an easy simultaneous movement of both hands, in the direction most favourable for the free division of the prostate, which will be about an angle of 50â€œ with the horizon. The knife is now to be carried gently along the groove through the prostate into the bladder, until the gland is completely divided, which the operator easily ascertains, by the resistance afforded to the knife ceasing. In passing the knife, to complete the section of the prostate, its handle should be lowered to the bottom of the external incision, by which a sufficiently large angle is formed between the knife and staff, and thus an opening in the gland is made, large enough to admit the extraction of a moderate sized stone. When the stone is of unusual dimensions, or the prostate increased in size, it will be advisable to dilate the opening in withdrawing the knife, in the same manner as when the beaked knife is used: in common cases the knife may be withdrawn along the groove of the staff without the necessity of dilating. OF THE HIGH OPERATION, OR THAT ABOVE THE PUBES. Not successful Attempts have been made to revive this operation, in this country and in France ; but in England, hitherto, they have been very unsuccessful. Preferable Those who have witnessed the general safety and facility in cScumSance^s^ performing the lateral operation will never make use of the high operation, but under peculiar circumstances ; as when the prostate gland is very much enlarged, or when a stone of great size exists. My opinion is, that it should be confined to a combination of these two circumstances, viz. the large stone, and large prostate, which render the operation in perineo very unsuccessful. Those who wish to be fully informed on this subject wull consult the work of Mr. Cai-pue, who has taken great and very laudable pains to explain this operation.

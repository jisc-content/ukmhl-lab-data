I have seen many instances where the dura mater and pia mater have been wounded, but few where the dura mater only has been.

You see that there is no necessity to operate where there is any additional risk, because an operation in a part w'here there is no risk can be as well performed, the object being only to raise the bone. The scalp is to be returned over the opening, and a poultice should be applied, which, I believe, is the application most congenial with the feelings, and most conducive to the safety of the patient.

If a person receives a blow from an instrument capable of lacerating the part, and considerable inflammation follows, the wound will sometimes destroy life.

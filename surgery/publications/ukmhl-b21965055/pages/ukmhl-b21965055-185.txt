ox INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 147 the brain, will be but imperfectly understood. There is also another circumstance connected with the brain, to which I wish particularly to direct your attention, viz. its being the vehicle of the mind; or, rather, I might say, the medium through which the mind is communicated. The influence of the brain on the mind, and vice versd, will be amply demonstrated to you as I proceed. Now, when the brain receives an injury, the symptoms stated to Symptoms, be the result of that injury are, general loss of sense and volition, if the injury be considerable; but if not so severe, some portion of sense and volition will remain; for example, when you are called to the bed-side of a person thus situated, you find him to be w'hat is termed comatose.

He finds him with a very severe laceration of the scalp, together with stupor, and sometimes even stertorous breathing. Not knowing that the individual was intoxicated at the time of receiving the injury, the surgeon attributes the above symptoms to concussion or compression, when, after a few hours, the person recovers from his drunken fit, and it becomes apparent that he received no other mischief than a wound in the scalp.

ON THE OPEUATION OF TllEl'lllNlNO. 185 spirituous liquors, he used to come back with violent pain in the head, which was always relieved by blood-letting'. As to the treatment of inflammation of the brain, it is the same as for inflammation generally, with this exception only, that blood mation. should be drawn from the temporal artery in adults, and the jugulai vein in children. Whenever inflammation of the brain attacks a gi-own person, take blood from the temporal artery; and w'hen young individuals, from the jugular vein; by these means you abstract blood more readily from the part. Even in adults you may, after opening the temporal artery, if the symptoms be not relieved, bleed ' from the jugular vein. In addition to this treatment, you purge, produce perspiration, and apply blisters to the head. I have seen poultices, containing some stimulating application, of considerable use. It will now and then happen that trephining will be required; and I wdll tell you the cases in which it will. THE OPERATION OF TREPHINING. First.- Where there is extravasation of blood between the dura Circumstances , 1 , ,, necessary for mater and skull. the operation. Secondly. In fractures of the skull wuth symptoms of com- pression continuing after depletion. Thirdly. In simple fractures, with depression, accompanied with symptoms of compression. Now it generally happens in thel^ last cases, where there is matter between the dura mater and skull, that there is fracture, and this is an indication of the seat of the injury which has been done to the brain; it is also followed by rigors and other symptoms; still it will be right in some cases, where there is no fracture, and the other symptoms, rigors, &c., are present, to penetrate the bone, to see whether matter is lodged between it and the dura mater. When an abscess has formed beneath the dura mater, I have never seen a case recover trephining for it, altl'.ough that membrane has been opened for its discharge.

(Extracted from Sir Asiley Cooper's Work on the Testes.) The testes are contained within the scrotum, at which they are Relative suspended at unequal heights; for the left testis very generally situation of tyil0 tr6^t6S« hangs lower than the right. Two advantages arise from this circumstance—First, that when the thighs are approximated, they are not pressed against each other; but one being received above the other, they are enabled to elude the violence which they would otherwise sustain:—Secondly, this difference in their heights pennits the suspension of the penis to the left side, instead of its being placed directly forwards. SCROTUM. This part is composed of two portions of the common integuments united in the middle ; and the place of their union forms a prominent line, which is called raphe. This line, which begins at the fraenum, descends under the penis to the scrotum, passes in the centre of the perinaeum, and is lost at the anus. The skin of the scrotum is abundantly yascular, and secretes perspirable and sebaceous matter; and the sebaceous glands are chiefly placed in the line of the raphe. The scrotum varies greatly in its appearance and size ; for under the influence of cold, it is small, contracted, and wrinkled ; under heat, it is relaxed, smooth on its surface, and greatly extended. The arteries which supply it with blood, are three in number on each side—: the external pudic; the perineal artery of the internal pudic; and, thirdly, an artery from the epigastric. The external pudic is the second branch of the femoral artery, springing from that vessel a little below Poupart’s ligament, and beneath the

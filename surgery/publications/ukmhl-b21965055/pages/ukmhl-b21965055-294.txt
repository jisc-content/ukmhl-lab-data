252 ON THE CUKE OE IIYDKOCEEE. The operations The operation by incision. absorption in the parts, and Avhat Ave do to facilitate the operation of these remedies, is, to have a bag or suspensory truss to hold the scrotum, and this is fastened by tAvo tapes round the abdomen, just beloAv the umbilicus, and kept constantly Avet Avith those fluids, in order to stimulate the absorbents; therefore be on your guard about performing an operation for hydrocele in young persons, as the cure can be effected by absoi-ption alone; there are a fcAV exceptions, hoAvever, to this rule, but they are exceedingly rare, as in almost every case of hydrocele in young persons or children, the Avater aauII be absorbed.

In the operation by incision you divide the scrotum and tunica vaginalis, on the front part, so as to alloAVthe water to escape, but it Avas soon found that this was not sufficient to effect a cure, and it Avas then recommended,

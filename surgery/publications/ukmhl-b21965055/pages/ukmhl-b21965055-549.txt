413 OF THE OPERATTON IN PERTNEO. catheter into his bladder through the urethra. I mention this to show how little the operation was required, and that the enlarged gland did not prevent the introduction of the catheter. OF THE OPERATION IN PERINEO. The neck of the bladder around the prostate gland is devoid of peritoneum; and, excepting the posterior surface, where the vasa deferentia and vesiculae seminales are seated, there is no important part which can be injured by a puncture. This operation requires more anatomical knowledge than the two Requires which I have described; it is more difficult to perform, and much knowledge, more care is required to preserve the opening into the bladder, yet, to a scientific surgeon even this presents but little difficulty. Mr. Cline used always to advocate its performance. The steps of the operation are as follow : Operation. First, An incision is to be made in perineo, as in the operation for the stone, and it is to be carried to the bulb of the urethra, where it is covered by the accelerator uringe. Secondly, The bulb is to be pressed by the finger to the patientâ€™s right side, and the incision is then carried onwards between the bulb and left crus of the penis, as far as the prostate gland. Thirdly, The surgeon is to pass his finger into the wound as far as the left side of the prostate gland, so that it may serve as a guide to the canula and trocar. Fourthly, The trocar and canula are to be pushed into the cavity of the bladder, by the left side of the gland. Fifthly, The trocar being withdrawn, the canula is left in the bladder to allow of the escape of the urine. Sixthly, Through the canula an elastic gum catheter is to be passed and secured, as in the fonner case. When the patient has recovered sufficiently, the natural canal is Subsequent to be opened by the use of a sound or bougie; and in all cases of considerable difficulty, when the urine passes freely by the artificial opening, a caustic may be safely employed.

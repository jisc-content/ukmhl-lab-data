To this I have only to obseiwe, that if the idea had previously occurred to any individual, he had so far buried it in his bosom that I had never heard of it; and, as to the instrument, I am quite sure that Mr. Weiss consulted no musty volume for its formation; for, so soon as I mentioned my wish, that he should construct a pair of forceps by dividing a sound in its middle, and giving it a joint two inches from its end, he, without quitting me, observed that he should make them to open, in the mode in which he now makes them. Mr. Weiss has a strong and ingenious mind, and does not use petty artifices to obtain employment or character.

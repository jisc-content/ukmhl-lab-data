180 ON WOUNDS or TUT, DRAIN. Remarks. Symptoms of inflammation decreased, and soon entirely disappeared. The wound healed in fourteen weeks, and he has since remained well. I observed a circumstance in this young; gentleman, after his cure, which shows the influence of mental excitement in agitating the brain, and in increasing, upon the instant, the quickness of its action. Something passed in conversation which displeased him : and his brain, which could be distinctly seen beating through the opening in his skull, immediately quickened from eighty to one hundred and twenty in the minute. Struck with this appearance, I watched it for a few minutes, and, as his mind became calm, the pulsation gradually sunk again to about eighty.

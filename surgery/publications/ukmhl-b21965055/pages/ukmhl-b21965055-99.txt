OW SUPPURATIO'N'. 61 The effusion of adhesive matter, by unloading' the vessels of the part, has the effect of reducing the inflammation, so that the process generally teminates as soon as this effect is produced, and this has led to the application of this principle for the reparation or restoration of some portions which have been destroyed by disease, or designedly mutilated. In the East Indies, where it is the practice of many of the chiefs to cut off the noses of many of their prisoners, an operation is frequently, and in most cases, successfully, performed, to make a new nose. Many curious cases of this kind are on record. LECTURE VIII. ON SUPPURATION. Suppuration is the formation of purulent matter from the secreting orifices of the blood-vessels, which matter is named pus. It is formed in xiavities produced in the body by a process of absorption, as in abscesses; it is found also as a secreted fluid on the surfaces of membranes, or upon granulating surfaces. The fomiation of matter is often attended with severe consti- tutional irritation; there.are rigors succeeded by heat. \Vhen, therefore, you see a person who has had severe inflammation, and you wish to know if suppuration has taken place, you ask him if he has had a cold shivering; for this is generally the forerunner of the purulent secretion. If the inflammation be extensive, or seated in any vital organ, the constitutional disturbance will be very great, and the shivering, which indicates the formation of matter, will be very severe, and followed by a powerful re-action. Whilst the rigor continues, the blood collects about the larger vessels in the neighbourhood of the heart, and in the heart itself; at length this organ becomes stimulated to action, and sends the blood with considerable force to all parts of the body, but more particularly to that part where pus is about to be secreted. A rigor, therefore, is Definition. Constitutional symptoms of suppuration.

In describing the different parts which compose the testis, I have mentioned the uses of each; and it was not my original intention to enter more largely into the physiology of this organ. The struc- ture of the testis being understood, the veriest tyro will readily comprehend the course of the semen. It is secreted in the tubuli, and is conveyed into the rete; from the rete into thevasa efferentia. It next passes through the epididymis to the vas deferens, which opens, in common with the duct of the vesicula serainalis, at the veru montanum, in the prostatic part of the urethra. LECTURE XXVI. ON THE DISEASES OF THE TESTICLE. That change to which the testicle is sometimes, but not very frequently subject, viz. the formation of a number of cysts or hydatids within its substance, is the disease which I shall first describe. OF THE HYD.'VTID OR ENCYSTED TESTICLE. This change in the testicle is usually obseiwed in the earlier periods of life, generally from eighteen to thirty-five ^mars, although I have seen it occur at forty-nine years. It has been said to begin in an enlargement at the end of the epididymis ; but of the part in which it commences I am by no means certain, whether in the testis or in the epididymis; for the enlargement is so gradual and imperceptible, that it is usually discovered by accident. The disease is generally unattended with pain, nor does the patient complain of any tenderness in the part when it is handled. It does not seem to be produced by or attended with any constitutional disease, for the appearance of the person is sometimes that of robust health. There is no redness of the scrotum, but the veins of the spermatic cord are, in some instances, very much distended

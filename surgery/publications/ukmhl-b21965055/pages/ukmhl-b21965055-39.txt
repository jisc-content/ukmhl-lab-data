LECTURES ON SURGERY. INTRODUCTORY LECTURE., Gentlemen,â€”While it is the .province of the physician to attend to internal diseases, it is the duty of the surgeon to attend to those that are external; to perform operations for the removal of diseased Definition, parts; and to know how to regulate the system by the use of me- dicine, when locaTdiseases are produced by constitutional derange- ment.* Surgery is usually divided into the principles and practice. The first are learned from observations on the living when diseased, by dissection of the dead, and by experiments on living animals. Our deductions from these sources furnish us with the means of knowing a malady by its symptoms, the alteration of structure in a part when diseased, and the various ways in which Nature attempts the reparative process, both in external and internal parts. A man who has seen much of morbid preparations possesses great advan- tages ; but his anatomical knowledge cannot be perfect unless he has frequently seen and assisted in the dissection of the human body. In surgical science, hypothesis should be entirely discarded. Hypothesis, and sound theory, derived from actual observation and experience, alone encouraged. The first is an ignus fafuus, which is sure to mislead; the last a polar star, a never-failing guide. Experiments on living animals have been found of the greatest utility in direct- ing us to a knowledge of the means by which Nature acts in the reparation of injuries, and in the restoration of lost parts, Thus the method she would adopt in uniting a fracture in the bone of a dog, will show you the manner in which union of a fractured bone * Ego eundem quidem hominem posse omnia ista preestare concipio: Sed ubi illi se diviserunt, eum laudo qui quam plurimum percipit.

OF THE TREATMENT OF THIS DISEASE. -317 felt full and loaded. He was somewhat, but only for a time, relieved by^the hot bath, or fomentations. He tried blistering at five different times: applied two hundred leeches, at separate times, to the aflfected part: employed also various lotions, opium, and belladonna, with eveiy medicine which seemed likely to be useful in lessening the irritability; but all without benefit. I removed the testicle for him in 1823: he quickly recovered from the operation, and felt veiy grateful for his restoration to society.

In a few days after, the part again became painful, for which I applied tepid poultices of bread and milk, and bathed it in warm water. The pain continued, and in about six weeks after, the operation was repeated; but very little water was drawn off: no injection was used. For some time previous, and for about six weeks after the second incision, I took mercurial pills, two or three each day, and occasionally used mercurial friction on the thigh and testicle, keeping up a soreness in the mouth, but not producing much salivation.

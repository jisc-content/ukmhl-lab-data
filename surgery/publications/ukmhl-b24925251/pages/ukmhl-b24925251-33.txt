HUNTERIAN ORATION. 27 light was, to think.” Mr. Hunter did not begin to learn anatomy till he was eighteen years of age ; but when the book of nature lay exposed to his view, he read it with facility, interest, intelligence, and dili- gence ; and the idle youth became a most industrious man. Like Haller, he devoted himself to physiology. Such minds could not but be highly sensible of the interest and importance of this study: they could not be contented with the mere notation of facts, without enquiring into their pro- bable causes and uses. Like Haller, he became an exact and comprehensive ana- tomist. No structure, nor substance want- ing structure, yet possessing life, escaped his strictest scrutiny. Like Haller, he in- vestigated the nature of function by expe- riment, yet how different is the conclusion of the labours and reflections, or the prin- ciples of the physiological doctrines of these almost contemporary and very extraordinary characters;—the one enriched from the pos- sessions of all others, and endowed with great degrees of intellectual powers ; the ether, rich only in natural genius and talent.

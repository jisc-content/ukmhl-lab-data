10 Here I cannot omit noticing a circumstance, which, though it appears trivial, indicates great unwilling- ness to give the smallest countenance to Clinical Surgery. The second edition of the Curriculum re- commends attendance upon a course of Clinical Sur- gery to the attention of the Students. But the third improved edition does not honour Clinical Sur- gery, even with the futility of a recommendation. To return to the analysis and refutation of the several objections. One member of the Medical Faculty opened the business by exclaiming, just as I had mentioned the number of Students of Clinical Surgery for the last year, " that the class was bolstered up by a re- " gulation of the College of Surgeons, which had u doubled, trebled, nay, he would say, had increased " the number of Students fivefold."* I was as- tonished to hear remarks so little to the purpose, and so little respectful to myself and to the Col- lege of Surgeons, come from a member of the Se- natus Academicus: For the remarks did not con- tradict any assertion, nor controvert any argument which I had advanced, nor did they, in the least, bear upon the question then under the considera- tion of the Senatus. While they were evidently calculated to degrade me in the estimation of my colleagues, by representing the prosperity of the class to depend upon extrinsic circumstances, wholly * The remarks about bolstering up a class, place me in a re- lation to the College of Surgeons, which may require an ex- planation from me regarding the manner in which I have con- ducted the course of Clinical Lectures on Surgery, as I do not choose to lie under the imputation of having been unworthy of the patronage with which the College of Surgeons has hon- oured me.

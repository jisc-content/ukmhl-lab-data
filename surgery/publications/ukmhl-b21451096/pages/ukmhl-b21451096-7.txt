diseased action, which may be easily transferred to explain the nature of similar morbid affections of the internal parts. Many internal and external dis- eases are perfectly alike in character. Inflammation, abscesses, swelled glands, and various other cases of daily occurrence in practice, afford instances of this identity. The benefit, therefore, which a young man derives from following this progress in the study of diseases, is incalculably great. The superiority of Clinical Lectures, as an advan- tageous method of conveying practical instruction, is most conspicuous in Surgery, on account of the ob- vious nature of the symptoms. A Student, who is diligent in his attendance upon a ward of Surgical patients, vigilant in watching the progress of the cases, attentive to the Lectures of the Professor, and careful to compare what he hears with what he observes, is certain to derive much real practical im- provement from employing his time in this manner. This profitable employment of time is, besides, at- tended with the farther advantage of affording the nearest approximation to actual practice which a Student can enjoy: For having the nature of the case and principles of the practice explained to him, the different reports and prescriptions communicated to him, and their effect upon the patient open to his observation, he has strong inducements to exert his own faculties in judging of the result. And as all his improvement is connected with his own per- sonal exertions, with his activity, industry, and ac- curacy of observation, he is daily acquiring habits of infinite value in preparing him to enter upon prac- tice with great advantage: for nothing is more im-* portant in the education of a young man, who is destined for a practical profession, than, early in life,

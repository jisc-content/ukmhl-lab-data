which Clinical Lectures possess in conveying useful instruction in the practice of Surgery. I have like- wise brought forward all the arguments urged against the proposed arrangement, accompanied, I trust, with a satisfactory answer to every one of them. If I have the good fortune to succeed in the at- tempt, I shall feel much gratified in having been the instrument of conferring a benefit upon the profession of medicine. If, on the contrary, I shall be disappointed of my object, I shall still have the consolation to reflect, with much satisfac- tion, on having done my duty to the Chair which I have the honour to hold in the University, to the profession of medicine, and to the public at large. The result of this business is a matter of indifference to me as an individual; since, at my advanced time of life, a few years will soon put an end to my labours as a public teacher. I already divide the duties of my office with another practi- tioner, who shares in the emoluments. The effect of an arrangement, the operation of which does not com- mence for several years, cannot affect one who is gradually retiring from the scenes of active life. Neither my reputation, nor my fortune, nor my rank in society, can be influenced by the vote which the Senatus Academicus gives on this occa- sion. There are no motives of self-interest prompt- ing me to exert my endeavours to promote the proposed arrangement; and I most sincerely hope, that every one who is to vote on this occasion, will divest himself from all feelings of prejudice and prepossession as completely as I am at this moment. My sole wish is, that the measure most advanta- geous to the public may ultimately be adopted.

Since, whatever ab- stractly considered, may be the most advantageous method of conducting a course of Clinical Lectures on Surgery, there is not a doubt that the form of general dissertations is the best adapted to the pur- poses of a physician, since his object is to obtain ac- curate comprehensive general views of the subject, without troubling himself with the details of the more minute particulars. According to the Profes- sor's own statement, therefore, the method of con- ducting lectures, which he censures in me, was in reality the best calculated to instruct a physician in all the principles of Surgery, which are applicable to medical cases. The method of conducting Clinical Lectures, which the Learned Professor condemns, refers to an epoch more than twenty years back, when he did me the honour to attend a course of Clinical Surgery. Since then I have endeavoured to improve the style of Lecturing, by keeping in view the model which he describes to be the standard of perfection in a Clinical Lecture; so that the criticism which might possibly be just at the period of his attendance, does not apply to the Lectures which I now deliver.

If such a liberty be tolerated, then we might hear censorious criticisms on all the Lectures in the University, on no better authority than common report. The abuse to which such a licence would lead, is too apparent to require any eluci- dation, though I do not mean to retaliate by making any re- marks upon what I hear of the learned Professor's lectures.

8 in the Curriculum just circulated, the Medical Fa- culty contents itself with enjoining attendance upon a single course of Surgery, and even that under cir- cumstances exceedingly unfavourable to the improve- ment of the Student, who is advised to attend Sur- gery in conjunction with Anatomy, during his first year at the University, a period when he must be supposed to be wholly unprepared to understand the most plain and elementary Lectures on Surgery. For every one must be aware of the impossibility of a Student deriving useful instruction from a course of Lectures on Surgery, while he is completely ig- norant of Anatomy. This injudicious conjunction, therefore, of Surgery and Anatomy, during the first year of attendance upon the medical classes, forms a radical defect in the constitution of the University, which even the great and acknowledged abilities of the present Learned Professor, Dr. Monro, is not able to overcome.* It is productive of several insu- perable disadvantages. In the first place, the atten- tion of the Student is distracted by being at one time obliged to attend to the details of two compre- hensive complicated subjects, both of which are quite new to him. He will therefore learn neither of them completely. In the second place, he will ac- quire the unfortunate habit of remaining contented with an imperfect confused superficial knowledge of * I have spoken with freedom respecting the imperfections of the mode of teaching Surgery in the University, from my con- fidence in being able to suggest a plan for curing them, without subjecting Dr. Monro to trouble or expense. He has only to give the two tickets for separate years, the ticket for Anatomy for the first year; and that for Surgery for next year. By this slight alteration the public will enjoy the full benefit of Dr. Monro's abilities, which are universally acknowledged.

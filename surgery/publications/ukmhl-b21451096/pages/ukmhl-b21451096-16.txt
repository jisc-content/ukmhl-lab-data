14 ing himself of the account which his Learned Col- league had given of the method in which I conduct Clinical Lectures, favoured the Senatus with some additional remarks upon the subject, by contrasting the excellence of the method which he follows, with the imperfections of the one which he ascribed to me. He, it seems, gives regular commentaries on all the cases under his care, at most, twenty-eight in number; while I select from nearly eighty cases, those which promise to afford most instruction to the Students. I shall not enter into an explanation of the particulars, in which Medical and Surgical Cli- nical Lectures differ from each other, since after ha- ving delivered above seventy courses, I may take credit to myself for being a competent judge of the best mode of conducting a course of Clinical Lec- tures on the practice of Surgery. The method which I pursue is the most laborious to myself, but by much the most useful to the Students. For I do not conceive the possibility of conveying much use- ful instruction to Students, by offering a few cursory superficial remarks upon the cases of seventy or eighty patients. A Student could never make him- self master of so great a number of cases, with any tolerable degree of accuracy, while the time allotted for the discussion of them would be much too short to admit of giving a satisfactory account of every case. An objection of a very singular nature, derived from a most unexpected source, was publicly mention- ed. The proposal to admit the Clinical Surgery into the number of protected classes, was represented to be unreasonable, because the College of Surgeons did not insist upon candidates for diplomas attend- ing Clinical Medicine.

9 important subjects, which he ought to understand thoroughly in all their details;, a habit most unfa- vourable to . the acquisition of useful fundamental knowledge, and which it is almost impossible to cor- rect in after life. As all the above-mentioned imperfections, with regard to the mode of teaching Surgery in the Uni- versity are obvious and undeniable, one should have expected that the Medical Faculty would have exerted their efforts to remedy the evil, by en- forcing attendance upon a course of Clinical Surgery, where a Student enjoys an opportunity to learn the doctrines of pure practical Surgery under the most favourable circumstances. Even some degree of countenance is due to a class which his Majesty has thought proper to endow upon the recommendation of the Senatus Academicus. The Medical Facul- ty, however, was not influenced by any of those con- siderations. But, disregarding an arrangement so reasonable in itself, and so advantageous to the Stu- dents, they have recommended a second attendance upon the Clinical Medicine, to the exclusion of the Clinical Surgery, from the number of pro- tected classes. The arrangement was accompanied with the additional unfairness of placing Clini- cal Surgery on a worse footing than it was before, by occupying the time in attending Clinical Medi- cine, which was before open in the option of the Stu- dent to attend Clinical -Surgery. For a Student, while here, and at the expense of one Infirmary ticket, has no opportunity to attend Clinical Sur- gery, if he comply with the regulation of attend- ing nine months upon Clinical Medicine. This re- gulation, therefore, seems to me to be an act of fla- grant injustice.

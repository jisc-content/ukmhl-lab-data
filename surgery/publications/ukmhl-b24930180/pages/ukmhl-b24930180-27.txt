been in strict correlation and interdependence with the work of Fritsch, Hitzig, and Ferrier. They have been with the first to appreciate critically and to apply at the bedside the physiological teaching of the laboratory. Among Surgeons, Lucas-Champion- nik’e in France, and Macewen in Glasgow, have been equally prompt and successful.” In a Leader in the Lancet on the ‘GVnnus Medicus, 1881,” there is the following :— “ The surgery of the nervous system also shows some advances. The experiments of Hitzig and Ferrier are bearing fruit, and are enabling surgeons to localize with precision lesions which anti- septic surgery can relieve. The cases reported by Marshall and Macewen bear witness to this fact, and they are but the first fruits of a rich harvest to be reaped gradually as our knowledge of cerebral localization becomes more perfect and general.” VI.—Paper on Osteotomy for Genu Valgum, Prepared at the request of and read at the International Medical Congress, Copenhagen, in August, 1884. The paper is included in the Trans- actions of the International Medical Congress. The following precis of the proceedings appeared in the British Medical Journal, August 23rd, 1884 :— International Medical Congress, Copenhagen, August, 1884.—Macewen s Operation for Genu Valgum. Interesting and important discussions arose on the paper of Dr. Macewen, of Glasgow, on the operation for genu valgum, this particular debate being remarkable for the almost complete renunciation of their own methods by other surgeons in favour of Dr. Macewen’s Osteotomy for Genu Valgum. Discussion 07i Dr. Macewen’s Paper— Professor Ogston (Aberdeen) said he had previously operated by a method which had been called by his name, and it was, he thought, now time that some conclusions should be come

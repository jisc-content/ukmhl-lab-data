After his address, Dr. William Macewen gave a demonstration of cases so remarkable that it alone would suffice to render the Glasgow meeting memorable in the annals of surgery. Many of the patients whose cases had been described in the address were present, but the many eminent surgeons who attended were greatly interested also in the examples of re-implantation of bone. The head cases afforded many instances, but the most remarkable was a boy, in whom the whole shaft of the humerus had been reformed from grafts, forming a useful limb. The audience was large, and Dr. Macewen was loudly applauded, and received numerous congratulations on his brilliant results.”

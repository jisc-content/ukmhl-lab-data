Translation ;—- “It is therefore from anatomical and pathological considera- tions that Ogston’s operation has been abandoned, and it is on anatomical, pathological, and clinical reasons that we prefer IMacewen’s operation to all others.” He then describes eighteen osteotomies performed by himself in the klinik of Tubingen, all with one exception by Macewen’s operation. In one case he per- formed on one side Macewen’s operation and on the other Ogston’s, and he found that while Macewen’s operation resulted in a per- fectly straight limb with free movement of the knee joint, that Ogston’s operation resulted in a stiff and partial ankylosis of the knee. He concludes his paper thus ;— “ The results of Macewen’s operation as laid down in these pages should suffice to give it the widest recommendation. It is indeed an operation resting upon a rational basis, of utmost simplicity, applicable to every constitution, and if antiseptics be strictly applied it is an o})eration without the slightest danger, which together with the simplest treatment of wounds leads to the quickest and most certain results.” Osteotomy in Belgium.

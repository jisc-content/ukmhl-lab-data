22 was interesting, not only in its i)ractical application, but also in its relations as a physiological experiment; and the process of reason- ing which had suggested this expedient to Dr. Macewen gave his paper high value as a contribution to physiology as well as to practical surgery.” In a note communicated to the Academie des Sciences, Paris, by ]\1. Ollier, “ Sur les Greffes Osseuses,” reference is made to the above as follows “ M. Macewen, de Glasgow, vient de confirmer de la maniere la plus 6clatante la r6alit6 de la greffe osseuse sur I’homme . . il a eu de plus l’id6e de la diviser en petits fragments. Ce pre- cede de lui a parfaitement r^ussi.” In a Leader in the Lancet, especially devoted to this communica- tion, the following appears ;— “ Great interest attaches to this case, which is the first of the kind recorded, and Dr. Macewen is entitled to warm praise for devising and carrying to such a successful issue the many details necessarily involved in its management.” The Lancet's “Annus Medicus,” 31st December, 1881, contains the following :— “ In quite another department of surgery we have to notice two additions to our means of assisting nature in the repair of injuries, both coming from Scotland. Dr. Macewen has shown us that bone can be transplanted, and will not only live, but excite the formation of a lost bone.” The case of transplantation of bone is noticed as one of the events of the year in the Surgical Retrospect of the Medical Times and Gazette, 31st December, 1881. It is further noticed in a Leading Article in the Medical Press and Circular, 1st June, 1881, from which the following is quoted :— “ The reproduction of bone from grafts has been again and again tried, but until lati^ly, no one has been able to record a successful attempt in this direction. As was the case with skin grafts, difficulties arose which had to be vanquished one by one ; but at length a veritable case of new growth from grafts has been

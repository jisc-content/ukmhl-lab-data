In a leading article in the Medical News, Philadelphia, October 22, 1887, on the ‘‘Osteogenic Factors in the development and repair of Bone,” there appeared the following;—“ Under the al)ove caption Dr. William Macewen, of Glasgow, presents an interesting and important contribution in the October number of the Annals of Surgery. There are but few persons who are entitled to speak with so great authority in regard to surgical affections of the bones, and any communication from him in regard to their pathology and surgery is sure to attract attention. In the present article the observations are physiological and in a measure experimental, and have a most important practical siirnificance.” Then follows two columns of resume and observa- tions thereon. In a second leading article in the same paper, on the appearance of the second part of the paper in the Annals of Surgery, there appears the following :—“ This paper is completed in the Annals of Surgery, and the discussion of the subject is continued in an additional series of })ropositions, which to a considerable degree tend to overturn the accepted views in regard to the role that the periosteum plays in the production of bone.”—Medical News, November 19, 1887.

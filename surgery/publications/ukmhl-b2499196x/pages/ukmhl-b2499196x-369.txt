!5 added to the copy by some copyist or other to give a classical look to the work. This explains at the same time vvhy a doublé introduc- tion —• first a Latin one, then a Flemish one — occurs' in the Cam- bridge ms. In this opinion I have been strengthened by a passage in the Ghent ms., fol. 105 a (p. 137, note 1), which reads as follows: „Here I will end the other book which is about the throat, whereby „I pray all those who will see it or be taught by it to pray for him, „who turned this book from Latin into Flemish” 1). And that it was no translator of Yperman’s who wrote this, appears from the continuation : „for I did it for love of those who would remain behind” 2) i. e. for his son. Finally I will point out a sentence in the Ghent copy, fol. (3) d (p. 145,) where „humours” are discussed, which according to Galenos „run to the sore place” 3), and where it says further „and so he puts it in Latin: ad locum dolorosum confluent humores”, an addition which would have had no sense in a Latin work. 1) „Hier wil ic eynde maken vanden anderen boeke dye es van den halze, wairbij ick bydde alle denghenen diere an zullen zien ofte leeren dat sij zullen bydden over denghenen, die desen boec trock uten latyne int Vlaamsche.” 2) „want ik deedt bij mynre (1. minne) van dengenen die achter mij soude bliven.” 3) „ter onsochter steden loopen”.

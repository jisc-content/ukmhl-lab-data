EXTRAIT DU „JANUS”, Leyde, 1913, E. J. Brill. NOTES CONCERNING THE LIFE OF JAN YPERMAN. by E. C. VAN LEERSUM. On the authorities of Diegerick and Carolus, Broeckx 1) has impor- tant details to communicate about Yperman’s life. He is said to have been born, presumably at Yperen in the last quarter of the 13*11 century, as the son of an Yprian Citizen. At about 1297—1303 he applied himself to the study of surgery under Lanfranc at Paris, enabled by a scholarship granted to him by the aldermen of his town. After having taken his degree, Jan Yperman is said to have settled in the vicinity of Yperen at about 1303 or 1304, but at nearly the same time to have been appointed, in the town itself, surgeon of the hospital of Belle. According to Diegerick, his mother Kateline had employment in Yperen at the hospital „sour le marchiet” 2), and after her decease in 1304 or in the beginning of 1305, she was succeeded by her daughter, also called Kateline. In spite of his appointment in town, Yperman lived in the country up to 1313, when the aldermen at last persuaded him to take up his abode in town. He lived in a house in the „Zuutstraete”, one of the principal streets of the formerly so flourishing and populous town. In 1325, when the town-council des- patched military forces, on the occasion of a quarrel between the count of Flanders, Louis de Grécy, and the citizens of Bruges, Yper- man was appointed army-sufgeon and a separate allowance was granted to him for it. The same thing happened in 1327, in recogniton of his good cares bestowed on the sick and poor of the town. As regards the time in which he wrote his „Cyrurgia” great uncer- tainty prevails. 1) La Chirurgie de Maitre Jehan Yperman, Chirurgien Beige (XlIIe —XlVe siècle), etc. 2e éd. Anvers, 1866.

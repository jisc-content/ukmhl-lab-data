„livres” granted to persons who were sent for a time to Paris by the aldermen, as there are „sous” mentioned here. It is indeed a pity that the rolls of 1298—1303, which might have throvvn sorae light 011 the matter, have been lost. Now that they are missing, however, it seems more prudent to me to leave alone the question whether Yperman did study it Paris. The arguments with which Diegerick has tried to support his opinion, are, I think, alto- gether untenable. The roll of 1305 contains a repetition of the one of 1304. Of the remaining available ones the register of 1308 mentions an amount of 4 HU 8 s., paid „a maistre Yperman pour le service que il a fait al ospital delle Belle”, while the accounts of 1309, 1310, 1311, 1315 and 1317 each mention an amount of 4 livres parisis. The salary does not seem high and not adequate to Yperman’s position, if compared to the fees enjoyed by other municipal physicians of the time. Diegerick 1) mentions: „A maistre Servais le Cupre, fusicien, 80 HE. „A maistre Jehan de Lille, fusicien, 35 HU. „A maistre Jehan le Clerc, fusicien, 13 HE. These, however, were physicians charged with the treatment of inter- na! diseases, which occur oftener than surgical cases. Therefore they had far more to do as parish-doctors than the surgeons, out of whose hands a good deal was taken moreover by the barbers. Yperman’s salary as doctor to the hospital of Belle was raised to 6 HE in 1317, and for extra-ordinary services he received adequate remuneration. Thus he received in 1327 10 HE „for a year’s attendance of the parish patients” 2). Also for his services as field-surgeon Yperman received special fees. He did indeed officiate a couple of times in this quality. The first time has evidently escaped Diegerick’s notice. Yperman then accom- panied a troop sent to seize the house „WijnendaeP’from the counts of an intrinsic value of over 20 francs; a „sou”, s. (' livre) of over 1 fr.; a „denier parisis”, d. p. (' ,2 sou), of about 0,09 fr. Thise values practically agree to the present ones of 125, 6,25 and 0,52 fr. Ypriana IV, p. 369. 1) He omitted to mention for which years these posts were. I found the following: A maistre Michiel Coep, fusisien, pour le quart d’une année, 17 HÈ 10 s. Des Marez and de Sagher, I, p. 570. (Le Brief du Salaire, Nov. 1315). 2) „van een jare van dat hij de arme lieden achter porten achterwart”.

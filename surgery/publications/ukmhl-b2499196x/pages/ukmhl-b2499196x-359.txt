7 Where did Yperman acquire his medical knowledge ? According to Carolus at Paris under Lanfranc, and he bases his opinion on this sentence in the „Cyrurgia”. „Whereby I advise as Lanfranc advised and taught me” i). „Ce passage," says Carolus 2), „prouve évidemment que 1’auteur Jean Ypermans fut élève de Lanfranc, qui professait a Paris en 1295.” I cannot admit this unreservedly, for the quoted words may have been taken figuratively as well as literally. Moreover in Yperman’s writings not a word is said of a stay in Paris. He does indeed mention Lanfranc’s name now and again, once (p. 75) adding his birthplace, viz. „Meylanen”, but he nowhere gives evidence of having been in any relation with this surgeon. This will indeed seem strange, for Lanfranc’s excellent practical teaching ought to have afforded Yperman an opportunity to cite in the Chirurgie the interesting and instructive cases which the master used to show his disciples. The only instance he mentions out of Lanfranc’s practice is not from Paris, but regards the Milanese woman, with whom the ingenious surgeon, after having opened a deep-lying abcess in the throat, succeeded in feeding by means of a „silver tube” 3). Yperman’s biographers go farther however. They believe that from the municipal accounts it may even be derived when the visit to Paris took place. For a good understanding of the matter it is desirable to consider those old-documents a little more closely 4). Vandenpeereboom 5) gives the following description: „Jusques vers 1390, les sommes payées, a titre de traitements, étaient renseignées, chaque année, dans un compte ou röle spécial, intitulé: „li Rolle dou sallaire”. Nos archives possèdent des fragments de comptes divers, a of: Des Marez et de Sagher, Comptes de la ville d’Ypres de 1267 a 1329. Brussels 1908. Of this important work only the first volume has appeared, treating the period of 1267—1316. 1) „Waerbi ic rade also Lanfranc mi riet ende leerde” (p. 21). 2) Ann. d. 1. Soc. cl. Méd. d. Gand. XXXIIe Vol., 1854, p. 64, note. 3) Lanfr. Major. Tract. III, Doet, II, Cap. 5. 4) Diegerick in his letter to Carton, gives the items referring to Yperman and the two Katelines Yperman. He has not, however, been accurate in this and his data are far from complete. Vandenpeereboom gives from the period with which we have to do, only copies of the „salary-rolls” of 1297, 1304, 1311 —1312. In G. des Marez and E. de Sagher Yperman’s name is to be found on pages 159, 184, 210, 236, 285, 338, 378, 392, 495 and 572. 5) Ypriana, IV, p. 357.

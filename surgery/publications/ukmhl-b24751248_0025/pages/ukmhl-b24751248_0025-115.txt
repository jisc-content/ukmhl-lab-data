Journal of Mental Science, April, 1864. Stewart has gone carefully over the records of the Crichtou Institu- tion at Dumfries, embracing a period of 24 years, and containing the general history of 901 cases. During the first 10 years pauper as weU as private patients were admitted, but subsequently only private, so that the cases belonging to the middle and uiaper classes of society pre- dominate. In considering in detail the following questions relative to hereditary insanity Stewart gives at the same time a general view of the results obtained by other investigations in such a form that they may be easily compared with those which he brings forward :—(I) The proportion of the insane having an hereditary predisposition to the disease. Authorities vary much in their computations of the frequency of hereditary tr-msmission, and this variation may be accounted for in many ways. Among the poor little is known of ancestry ; among the rich, on the contrary, every information may be obtained, but not in- frequently it is partly or entirely withheld. Some authors call only those cases hereditaiy in which mental disease has been known to exist in the direct line; but it is important to remark, says Guislain, that the transmission is not always direct; that the father of an insane person may not have been affected, while the grandfather, or aunt, or uncle, or cousin, may have presented symptoms. In asylums where acute cases only are received it may be easily understood that heredi- tary tendency does not reach a figure so elevated as in those where epileptics, idiots, imbeciles, and incurables are received. When mental disease appears in an individual some authors recognise it as hereditary if the parents have suffered from any nervous disease, while others hold that unless the parents have been actually insane (some even de- manding that the insanity be of the same form) there is no evidence of hereditary transmission. The above statements explain the great dis- crepancy observable among the following figures:—Esquirol in the Salpfetrifere found a per-centage of i3'3o, in his private house of 34*80, at Charenton of 31*34. Guislain states it at 30 in one computation, in a second at 5*96. Hoist makes it 69, Jessen 65, Parchappe 15, Aubanel and There 4*37, Michea 50 to 75, Damerow 24-29, Webster 32, Brigham 26*67, TIauruam 32^6 or including collateral 47*7, Hayner 11*97, Burrows 85'7i, Noble 40, Hood 9*59, Morel 20, Marcel 42*85 in one and in another computation 90, Howe 84*52, Moreau (de Tours) 90, Ellis 15*36. Stewart's general conclusion is that it may fairly be inferred that the more perfect our information concerning the

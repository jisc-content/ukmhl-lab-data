SPA-WEEB BOUGIES. 347 position required, they should be kept there until it is judged proper to remove tliem. And this leads me to remark upon another point in connection with their rapid enlargement. "When in free contact with moisture, thej swell so much that their diameter is more than doubled. !Now, although in the smaller numbers this increase in size may not be capable of producing any mischievous consequences, yet if we see fit to use such a size as No. 7 or 8, it will be most important to bear this pro- perty in mind: suppose such a bougie introduced fully into the bladder, beyond a stricture situated about the bulb, all that part of the bougie in contact with urine dilates to the full extent; that within the grasp of the stricture, only to the size of No. 10 or 11: hence we have a large and somewhat softened bulb at the distal side of the obstruction, and it is plain that its withdrawal will be both difficult and painful, even if the tenacity of the instrument be sufficient to prevent the serious ac- cident of its fracture. Hence, the caution is imperative of not advanc- ing the bougie into the bladder—in fact, the distance of the stricture from the orifice should be carefully measured before the bougie is finally settled into its place, and the point of the bougie should only just pass beyond the vesical end of the stricture."

He thinks that he has sometimes prevented recurrences by injections of very weak

Verneuil, removal of a parotid tumour (' Gaz. Hebd.,' 1863, p. 772). —A man, £et. 41, was admitted into the Hotel-Dieu in i860 with a fibro-glandular tumour as large as a hen's egg; it evidently included the greater part of the parotid, and adhered firmly to the skin and deeper parts. Owing to the impossibility of enucleation, the knife had to be used ; there was considerable haemorrhage, though no large vessel was wounded; the carotids were exposed for the distance of three centimetres. After the operation there was for a short time a little ptosis of the right half of the lip, and eight days later an attack of erysipelas; in a month cicatrization was complete, with the exception of a little salivary fistula. lu 1861 M. Verneuil again saw his patient; the cicatrix was red and slightly raised. Two years later, in last July, an operation was again required. The whole right half of the neck was occupied by a very vascular tumour, extending from the ear nearly to the clavicle, and from the ascending ramus of the jaw to near the spinous processes. The tumour was immovable. The absence of any diHplacement of the tonsil and pharynx appeared to show that there was no deep pro- longation. Deglutition, voice, respiration, and hearing, were normal;

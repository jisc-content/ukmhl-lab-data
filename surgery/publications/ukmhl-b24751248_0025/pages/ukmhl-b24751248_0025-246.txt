Gen.,' 1864, i, 257).—In the treatment of this disease, the all- important indication is to destroy the primary local lesion, on which the various secondary symptoms depend. With this object two prin- cipal methods have been employed—(i) destruction of the pustule by caustics ; and (2) by the actual cautery. The former is the method usually employed in the localities, where the disease is endemic. There are many objections to both these plans; to the former the slow and irregular action, the great and long-continued pain; to tlie latter, that it only destroys the part superficially, so that it is necessary to vise numerous cauteries—sometimes twelve or fifteen; still more important is the objection, that the surgeon cannot by either plan recognise when he has cauterized sufficiently; he can only guess when to stop, and is equally liable to destroy too much or too little. All tliese inconveniences may be avoided by preliminary excision of the pustule. The method followed by the authors is as follows :—After having carefully determined the margin of the pustule, its base is circumscribed by an incision; the little tumour is raised by forceps, and carefully dissected from the subcutaneous cellular tissue; the fundus of the wound must be carefully examined, and every trace of - induration excised. Finally the bleeding surface is cauterized with the hot iron. The consequences of this operation are most simple, provided it has been performed before the occuiTcnce of general symptoms ; the pain is immediately relieved by the application of cold water. Next

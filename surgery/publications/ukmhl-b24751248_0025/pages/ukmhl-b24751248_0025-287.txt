SECONDAllY CANCEROUS GROWTHS. 275 corous cachexia.' But it may be explained also in a manner in harmony with the general doctrines of the cellular pathology; and that, too, I think, with the greatest deference for the learned and philosophical founder of this school, without the necessity of having recourse to the supposed irritating effects of cancerous juices. For, in reality, what necessity is there for us to resort to other methods to explain the production of these secondary growths, diffei'ent from those which are supposed to have given origin to the first ? They are all tumours or new forma- tions, and hence all alike come, in the apt and terse language of Paget, to be considered not only as hypertrophies, but ' parts overgrowing, and as overgrowing with appearance of inherent power, irrespective of the growth or maintenance of the rest of the body, discordant from its normal type, and with no seeming purpose.' The same errors of nutri- tion—whatever be their nature—that were sufficient by their deviation from the ordinary equable and normal mode of development, to give rise to these local manifestations of abnormal but inherent powers of growth, would surely be adequate to the production of other growths of a similar nature in different parts of the body. It seems difficult to conceive any reason why, when we meet in the body with several new formations of a similar nature, it should be thought necessary—in the face, too, of so many difficulties—to assume that the first has been, in some obscure way, causative of its successors, when we have every right to imagine that the same causes were in operation during their produc- tion, as existed and probably helped in the genesis of the first." " Seeing, as we do, from actual observation, how frequently these so-called malignant growths are produced in a multiple manner, we may assume that there is an inherent tendency in the organism to the production of growths of this particular nature ; just in the same way as we must suppose something similar to account for the extraordinary number of fatty or fibrous local aggregations, in the cases of multiple tumours of either of these types, which are from time to time met with in the body of the same patient. And the difference between the two cases seems to be this, that whereas in the case of fibrous tumours it is but rarely that such a disposition iS manifested, and the progress of the several growths is for the most part slow; whilst, on the other hand, with cancerous products, this seems to be the rule, that the state of system, or tendency in the organism, which results in their forma- tion, is of such a tendency and superior activity as to lead for the most part to the production of rapidly increasing growths in different parts of the body, either simultaneous or successive. And just as this ten- dency is capable of producing obvious and sensible alterations in nutrition, so may it also be capable of producing other obscure and imperceptible changes in the general nutrition of the body, such as fully to account for those cachectic conditions of the system so often met with, over and above what may fairly be ascribed to the effects of local irritation and ulceration produced by the various growths themselves. The fact that where many cancerous formations exist in the same body, these are mostly found to be of the cnceplialoid type, may be only an index of the intensity of the diathesis; which is also borne out by the rapidity of their growth, and by the fact of their scarcely ever passing

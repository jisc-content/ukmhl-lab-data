I death to 9 recoveries, or a mortality of 10 per cent.â€”T, W, AMPUTATIONS NEAR THE ANKLE. a95 cases of Pirogofl"s amputation, on an average, 4,3'6 clays; under i month, 9 ; minimum, 19 days. As to the serviceable nature of the stump, he states that, in 71 cases of Syme's amputation, it was perfectly good in 13, good in 55, useless in 3. In 4j cases of Pirogoff's amputation, it was perfectly good in 23, good in 20, useless in 3. In 12 cases performed after the method of Baudens-Eoux, it was perfectly good in 6, good in ^, useless in i. The point principally in dispute about Chopart's amputation has been the ser^dceable nature of the stump. The author states that out of 82 cases there were ^^o with perfectly useful stumps, and 32 with luxation of the astragalus ; most of the latter could walk, however, with proper boots. Throughout this paper the author compares his own results with the statistics of other authors. He concludes that in respect to the mortality, amputation at the seat of election gives i death to 2*55 recoveries, or a mortality of 28'09 per cent.; amputation close to the malleoli, i death to 5 recoveries, or a mortality of i6-6 per cent.;* amputation, according to Syme, i death to 5*9 recoveries, or a mortality of i4'4 per cent. ; according to PirogoiF, i death to 6'8 recoveries, or a mortality of 127 per cent.; according to Textor-Malgaigne (sub- astragaloid), i death to 13 recoveries, or a mortality of 7'6 per cent. ; Chopart's amputation, i death to 5^9 recoveries, or i4'4 per cent. In regard to the length of time required for healing the wound, the ojjerations of Chopart, Textor-Malgaigne, and PirogoiF are much the same; then follows amputation near the malleoli, then that of Syme, and finally that at the seat of election. In regard to the usefulness of the stump, the operations of Pirogoff and Malgaigne are the best; then follows that of Syme, then that at the seat of election, Lenoir's operation, and finally that of Chopart.

368 IIKPORT O'S SURGKllY. uiortem oxamiuatiou the braiu and its membranes appeared normal; the cavernous and circular sinuses were full of pus ; the right internal jugular was for a short distance filled witli a soft red clot. There were two large ulcerations of tlic mucous membrane in the nasal fopsic. Tiio ophthalmic vein was full of pus. Both lungs were adhei-ont by means of yellowish soft false membranes; in the riglit pleural cavity there was some fluid pus, and there were numerous metastatic abscesses in the lungs. The author considers that the morbid prbcess sprang from the ulcera- tions in the nasal fossa>, the inflammation thcji spread along the frontal and ophthalmic veins to the cavernous sinus. Cases of facial phlebitis have been observed in furuncle, &c., of the face (vide Giintncr in ' Year- Book; 1863, p. 166). M. Dubreuil has published (' Gaz. Hebd.,' 186.3, P- 764) two cases of facial phlebitis with furuncles; one recovered and the other died; in both cases there were orbital abscesses. H. Lee, obliteration of varicose veins (' Brit. Med.

Holmes distinguishes from congenital cysts properly so called, an aflection which he calls the conffenitalinnoccnl iumour ('Lane.,' 1864, i, 575, 605). He describes it as '' a solid tumour, developed before birth, and sometimes growing with great rapidity in the early days of life, so as to threaten to prove fatal, either by exhaustion or by its pressure on organs in the neighbourhood." He has met with these tumours in the neck (three times), on the nape and back of the head, in the orbit, and (a doubtful case) in the pharynx. The disease appears to have no cha- racter of malignancy except rapid growth. Cysts are very common in

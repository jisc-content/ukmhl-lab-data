830 EEPOET ON SUIIGERY. were definitely removed; by the 8th tlie lower aud by the 15th the upper aperture had closed, llemarkable improvement in the "general health followed the incision made on the ist November. There is now, 4th Pebruary, no pain in the epigastrium ; the latter is normally depressed; the percussion sound is clear, aud the patient is in perfect health. The catheter, which is to be introduced through the large trocar, should exactly fill it; the author tliinks that this ti-eatment exposes the patient to less danger of effusion into the peritoneal cavity than even a capillary puncture; for the catlieter completely fills the aperture made by the trocar in the cyst, and through it the fluid constantly runs off as soon as secreted. Tor the same reasons the drainage-tube introduced after the formation of a second aperture should exactly fill the curved canula. After from 7 to 10 days, by which time adhesions will have formed, the catheter may be advantageously replaced by one still larger. "We may sum up the treatment proposed by Dr. Boinet as'follows:—If the cyst suppurates, a large ti'ocar is introduced, and through it a catheter; after 7—10 days the latter is replaced by one still larger. A few days later, a puncture is made from within outwards near the edge of the right ribs, five or six centimetres above the first aperture, and a drainage-tube is passed in at one, and out at the other opening. After a sufficient lapse of time an incision, 2 to 3 centimetres long, is carried from the upper towards the lower aperture. The rest of the treatment consists of daily iodine injections. The tube must be retained till the cyst is completely obliterated. In the discussion that followed ('Gaz. d. Hop.,' 1864, p. 82, 107; ' Gaz. Hebd.,' 1864, p. 278), M. A^'oillemier defended the method of Eecamier and severely criticised that of M. Boinet; he asserted that the experiments of Cruveilhier had decisively shown that caustics excite adhesive inflammation of the peritoneum, a result confirmed also by clinical experience. J.

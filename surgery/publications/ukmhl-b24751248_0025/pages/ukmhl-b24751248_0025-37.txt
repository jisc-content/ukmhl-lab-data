SrETAMOEPlIOSIS OF MATTER, 25 quarts, and the mare soon lost its obesity, and became vigorous and Beiation of Food and Excretion.—Vetienkokr mi Yoit have given a farther extension to their researches on nutrition, using the same dog on which their former experiments were made. Having lived on mixed diet for more than 3 months, he was fed for 2^ days on 48-4 oz. of pure flesh; the ist, 5th, 9th, 13th, and i8th days were passed in tlie respiration apparatus. After the second day an equilibrium was maintained between the nitrogen consumed in the flesh and that excreted in the urine and feces. In 10 consecutive days the dog excreted an average of 1674 grs. urea, which, according to Voit's former experiments, represents all the nitrogen of the urine. The total solid content of the urine was 2360 grs., of which 253 were salts ; thus, there existed in it, besides the urea, 433 grs. of organic substance, which consisted of 149 grs. carbon, 38 grs. hydrogen, and 248 grs. oxygen. On one day the dog produced, further, 171 grs. dried faces, consisting of 77 grs. C, 11 grs. H, 11 grs. N, 23 grs. O, and 51 grs. salts. To these excreta the respiration has to be added. On the other hand, the dog consumed daily in the flesh 1364 grs. C, 2362 grs. H, 891 gra. N, 16,883 grs. O, and 282 grs. salts. He con- sumed also 7395 grs. 0 from the air. From these data results the following equation : Consiimplion. Excretion. Carbon' 187-8 i8o'o gramtnes. Hydrogen i52"S iS7'3 ..

This difference, amounting to less than i per cent., resolves itself almost entirely into a loss of water; that is, of hydrogen and oxygen, in the proportion of 4-8 H to 33-4 O. A further proof of the accuracy of the method was given by the fact that the direct determination of the inspired O agreed withiu 20 grains with that given by the calculation of ingesta and excreta. According to these results, the dog accomplished its entire metamor- phosis of matter within 24 hours exclusively from the food consumed; and, with tlie exception of a very small quantity of water, no constituents of its body were employed in it. Only on a flesh diet is it possible (in the dog) to establish a condition in which the sum of the elements of the effete parts of the body (solid and liquid) is equal to the sum of the elements of its food (flesh and oxygen), the other elements of the body wliich have a diff'erent composition from the food taking no part in the metam.orphosis. To account for the deficiency of 3-8 grammes (59 grains) of carbon in the excreta as compared with the ingesta, Pettenkofer and Voit think it probable that a small formation of fat takes place from the flesh (78 grains a day). If all the nitrogen of flesh is subtracted in the form of urea,

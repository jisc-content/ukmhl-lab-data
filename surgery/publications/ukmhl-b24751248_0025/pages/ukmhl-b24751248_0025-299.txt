ChSrin, case in which the forearm was torn off during an attempt at reduction of an old dislocation of the humerus (' Gaz. Hebd.,' 1864, p. 299; and 'Med. Times and Gaz.,' 1864,1, 400).â€”A woman, ast. 63, entered the St. Louis Hospital for a dislocation of the left shoulder, of three months' date, the arm being completely paralysed. The sensi- bility of the skin, though diminished, was not lost; there was no change in the temperature, but the lower part of the forearm and the hand were oedematous. She suffered violent pains in the limb. The patient having been placed under chloroform, extension was made by four intelligent assistants, through the medium of bands applied at the wrist. While traction was being gently made, the limb suddenly separated, and fell to the ground. The artery, which bled freely, was tied; the end of the humerus was excised, and covered over by a lateral flap which had been left. On examination, the limb was found to have separated at the elbow-joint, and every tissue, muscle, bone, vessel, &c., was found in a soft and friable condition. The muscles separated under the pressure of the finger just like a soft coagulum of blood. M. Gu6rin attributed these lesions to compression of the brachial plexus by the head of the humerus. Messrs. Broca and Houel doubted whether traumatic paralysis could, in three months, cause such changes in the bone. Acccordiug to them, there must have been atrophic softening long before the accident. According to this hypothesis, the same alteration would be found in most of the bones of the skeleton. The patient died 12 days later, and it was then found that the bones of the luxated limb were the only ones softened.

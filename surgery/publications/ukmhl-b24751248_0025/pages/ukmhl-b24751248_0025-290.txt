REPOUT ON SURGERY. 27S jaw and the tliickcned soft parts give sufTicieiit suj)port where the bone has been excised. 3. Tlic bono is more likely to be regenerated, on the one liand because the periosteum is less damaged, on the other because tlie patient is in better condition. No regeneration takes place if the operation is delayed too long. Tiie author sums up the more important practical results to the following effect:— I. Phosphorus-periostitis occurs in a more acute or chronic form according to the intensity of the poison and the individual predis- position. a. The treatment may be expectant or operative;—in chronic cases the former with proper attention to the general health, in acute the latter. 3. The operation must be performed at a very early period. The surgeon should not wait for demarcation of tlie disease, but remove the whole part that is already dead—with the anticipation of later recurrences. The rules of general surgery cannot be applied to the acute form of periostitis caused by phosphorus. 4. In the operation the periosteinn should be preserved as much, and the external soft parts injured as little, as possible. P.

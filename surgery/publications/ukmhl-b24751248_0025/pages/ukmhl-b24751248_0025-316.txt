For exactly analogous reasons, tlie lustre is very nuirkcd and very readily perceived in albinos. Itetiual cancers, liglil- coloured choroidal tumours, fibrous degenerations of the separated retina, very closely resemble the tapetuin in tlieir physical qualities. A. V.

Review,' i, 272), when it is necessary to remove from the lower lid new growths which have affected its whole thickness (from^the integument to the con- junctiva, and even from the inner to the outer canthus), but which do not extend far down, not indeed more than 3 or 4 lines from above downwards, there is no occasion to replace, by transplantation, the ex- cised piece; for we may safely calculate on the fibres of the orbicularis gradually dragging upwards {i. e. pressing the lower towards the upper lid) the cicatrix which now unites the cutis to the coujimctiva, and that thus the patient will recover tlie power of closing the lids. Dr. H. Koller, cases of ectropium from Professor Arlt's clinic (' Ophth. Eeview,' i, 274).—The third case is to the following effect: a robust man of 33 had been burnt about the right frontal eminence about 14 months previously. During cicatrization the upper lid was gradually drawn upwards and everted, so that he could only partially shut his eye. An attack of corneitis induced him to apply at the General Hospital; 5 weeks later, when transferred to the eye-clinic, the inflammation was already passing away. The skin of the right half of the forehead was replaced by a cicatrix reaching from the root of the nose and edge of the orbit over a space 5 inches high and 3 inches broad. The outer two-thirds of the upper lids were everted; its ciliary border was applied to the edge of the

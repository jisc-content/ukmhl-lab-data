STATISTICS, ETC. Braxton Hicks, M.D., " The Fourth Eeport of the Guy's Hospital Lyiug-In Charity " (' Guy's Hospital Eeports,' vol. 10, 1864). " The Fourth Eeport of the Guy's Hospital Lying-in Charity" gives a summary of all the cases attended during the nine years ending Sept. 30, 1863. The operations of the charity have been before described ('Tear-Book,' 1863, p. 339). The reports given are of cases occurring in out-door practice ; and in computing the relative mortality of these cases with those of in-door charities, it must be remembered that in this charity the patients continue for a longer period under supervision, and seek admission into the hospital long after the ordinary term of attendance has expired. The total number of women attended was 14,871, and of children bom 14,909. Of these, 14,375, or 95-6 per cent., were born alive, and 623, or 4-6 per cent., stillborn. ' In 14,962 of whom the sex is mentioned 7825 were males and 7137 were females, or as 100 to 91. Of the children born alive the males constituted 52 per cent., while of 587 stillborn the males were 347, oi' ';9"4 per cent. Hence the proportion of ma es to females stillborn was greater than the ratio of males to females born alive. Or, in other words, there is a greater relative loss of male infants in parturition, due, as shown below (Table II), to the greater prevalence of podalic and pelvic presentations.

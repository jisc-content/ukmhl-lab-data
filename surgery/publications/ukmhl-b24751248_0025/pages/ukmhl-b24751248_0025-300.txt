Fergusson on excision of the hiee ('Lane.,' 1864, ii, 31, 59).—Li comparing the results of excision with those of amputation, the author remarks that " a well-healed stump never in reality improves, unless, possibly, it gets somewhat more callous, whilst often it gets more tender and irritable; but the seeming perfect result of excision at the end of six or twelve months (just when stumps are generally at the best) is no criterion of true perfection. If the limb is properly managed afterwards, it goes on improving for months—aye, for years. Without again discussing the question as to length, and without applying the remark to all, I can affirm, from ample experience in my own practice, that thigh, leg, and foot, enlarge in bulk; and, in par- ticular, that with this change the leg and foot improve in muscular energy. It may to some be more impressive when I say that the calf of the leg shows again in increased muscularity and vigour. This oh- serA'ation has never yet, I believe, been dwelt upon by those who liave written of the good qualities of limbs after excision; but it is an im- portant fact, and one which, in my opinion, goes far to balance that of shortening, which has been so eagerly put forward by writers previously referred to." The autlior insists strongly on the value of the foot, quoting, as examples, Ducornet, who painted with his toes, and Hervio

Sabine, tlie treatment of aneurism involving the suhclavian in such apart of its course that a proinvial lirjature is only applicahle ivithin the scaleni ('Amer. Med. Times,' 1864, ii, 74, 89, loi, 116).—The author discusses in succession medical treatment, external applications, com- pression, galvano-puncture, injection, manipulation, amputation, distal ligature, and the proximal ligature. The successful employment of the last method is the great desideratum. " No other, excepting perhaps indirect compression, aifords so safe, speedy, and eftectual a cure as this ; and hence in those cases which have been hitherto unsuccessful, it should be our aim to seek out and remedy, if possible, the causes of failure. This is the more important in subclavian aneurism where in- direct compression is impossible, and the other methods inapplicable. These methods I have already briefly discussed, and the conclusion arrived at was, that none of them, excepting perhaps amputation, aftbrd much, if any, chance of success. Amputation has never been resorted to, and hence all reasoning upon the subject can only be hypothetical; besides, amputation necessitates the loss of a most important member, in most cases the rir/lit arm, and ought not to be thought of if proximal ligature can be rendered a tolerably successful operation. Hitherto it has not been so, and I shall now discuss tlie dillerent operations that have been performed, their causes of failure, together with two new ' operations which have not yet been tried, but eitlier of which appears at present to afford good grounds for believing that they will prove

MOUTH. W.

The tension of the lip over this part has threatened to be too much for the recent adhesions. In only one instance has there been total failui'c of union, and in that I afterwards repeated the operation with success. In several cases there has been serious threatening of non-union by the gap opening an hour or two, or a day or two, after the stitches have been removed. In such instances I have scraped the surface, introduced needles again, and put all up as at first, and thus made the process appear only as one. This method I have rarely seen fail. On one occasion a child was running about eight days after a very successful operation for a single fissure. It unfortunately fell on its face, and at once split the union open. Although eight miles oil", it was brouglit to me within a couple of hours, when I introduced fresh needles, and with the ordinary care the result was as perfect as could be desired." C.

NERVOUS SYSTEM. 93 partial paralysis iu 9, uo paralysis iu i. Affectiou of the speech has been said to be dependent on lesion in the anterior lobes. This symp- tom was noted in 3 only of the cases under discussion, and in none of them were the anterior lobes implicated. In 1 case the arachnoid was the seat of the clot, in another the middle lobe, and in the 3rd the corpus striatum. There does not seem to be a very decided conriection between the condition of the pupils and the alterations of intelligence. Of the 29 cases in which the state of the pupils was noted, both w^ere contracted in 9 and dilated in 5 ; i pupil was dilated in 6 cases, and i contracted in i. In 4 cases the pupils were inactive, and in 4 they were natural. In those cases of altered intelligence in which the pupils were contracted paralysis existed in 88-8i per cent., and in those in which the pupils were dilated paralysis coexisted in 55 per cent. From the foregoing Jones infers that in those cases of deep iinconsciousness, as- sociated with partial or with no paralysis and contraction of both pupils, the clot is most probably in contact with the membranes. Out of 38 cases, 3 occurred between the ages of 30 and 40 ; 13 be- tween 40 and 50; 10 between 50 and 60 ; 9 between 60 and 70 ; 3 be- tween 70 and 80. These figures, corrected for the numbers living at each decennial period, give the following estimate of the liability to cerebral haemorrhage. Between the ages of 30 and 40 the attacks are V2 per 1000; between 40 and they rise to 7"2 per 1000; between 60 and 70 to 7"6 per 1000; between 60 and 70 to 9 per 1000; and be- tween 70 and 80 they are only 6 per 1000. The male sex is more liable than the female in the proportion of 29 : 11. Exciting causes.â€” There seems to exist a most intimate connection between disease of the kidneys and of the heart and arteries and cerebral haemorrhage. In 36 fatal cases, of which Jones has notes, the kidneys were found exten- sively diseased in 29, showing the high per-centage of 80*5. In 24 of these cases the organs were described as being small, hard, granular, with wasted cortical substance. In 4 the kidneys were large, soft, con- gested, and cystic, with old cicatrices on the surface. In another case I kidney was reduced to a very small trace, whilst the other appeared healthy. This large per-centage of nearly 90 per cent, cannot but be regarded as indicating a most intimate relation between disease of the kidneys and cerebral hemorrhage. Besides, if the analysis be still further prosecuted, it will be found that renal disease bears a close relation to cardiac disease in these cases; for out of the 29 cases in which the kidneys were found disorganized, the heart was hypertrophied to a great extent in 15, and this hypertrophy chiefly afiected the left ventricle. In i case the heart was fatty, in 3 very weak. Of these 19 cases, in which were found alterations in the muscular structure of the heart, atheromatous deposits were found in 18 on the mitral and aortic valves, but probably not to such an extent as to give rise to obstruction sufficient to produce the hypertrophy ; hence we must look for a cause remote from the heart itself. Of the remaining cases, in which the muscular tissue of the heart was described as healthy, atheromatous deposits were found on the mitral valves in 6, in i of which there was thickening and opacity of the lining membrane on the right side, in 3 there were atheromatous deposits on the aortic valves, and the same i

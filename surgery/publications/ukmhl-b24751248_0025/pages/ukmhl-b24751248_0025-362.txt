350 IlEPORT ON SUEGEB,Y. iuto the bladder. A probe introduced from tlie rectum through the fistulous opening at once came in contact with the catheter in the urethra. Tlie incision, in healing, had not left the anal aperture of the usual circular appearance, but had caused it to be prolonged for- wards in a grooved or angular form. He had good retentive power over bis iicces, but when he passed urine a considerable portion, after escaping through the listula, flowed along this groove down his thighs. He stated that his urine was voided in about equal quantities in this way and by the penis; the annoyance, therefore, was very great, for his clothing was continually saturated with it. The escape, of course, was not constant, as in the case of a fistula leading into the bladder, but only took place periodically and during the act of micturi- tion, liepeated applications of nitrate of silver and of the actual cautery having proved iueflfectual, I determined to pare the edges and bring them together with sutures. " Operation, Jan. 13th.—The large end of Bozeman's speculum was introduced into the rectum, and, to afford increased facility for getting at the aperture, I made a slight incision through the skin and super- ficial fibres of the sphincter on each side. The edges of the fistula were then carefully denuded, and four silver-wire sutures passed. The ends of the sutures were brought through the apertures in a narrow leaden plate, after Bozeman's method, and fastened with perforated shot. The silver catheter which had been held in the urethra and bladder during the operation was then tied in, and the patient sent to bed. i " The catheter was retained for two days, but being found to cause a good deal of pain and irritation, it was then dispensed with, and the patient was allowed to pass his urine by his own efforts along the urethra, which he did without pain and without any leakage through the wound. The leaden plate and the sutures were removed eight days after the operation, when the edges of the wound were found to be in good apposition and well united. There has been no escape of urine by the rectum since the operation, and, at the date of this report, 16 days afterwards, he passes the whole of his urine readily, and in a good stream, by the urethra."

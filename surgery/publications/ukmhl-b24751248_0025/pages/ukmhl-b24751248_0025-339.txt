CASE or EPIGLOTTITIS. 8S7 The voice was almost inaudible. He had very little cough, and the febrile reaction was slight. The fauces appeared almost normal: but, on examination with the finger, the epiglottis could be felt as a hard solid ball, filling up the lower end of the pharynx. The treatment con- sisted of calomel to slight salivation, and repeated puncturing of the swelling. On Sept i8th he was quite well. The author has, after careful search, been able to meet with only the following cases :—a by Burne in the ' Med. Gaz.' for May, 1830 ; 2 by Kesteven! in the same journal for 1849; 3 by Sir H. Marsh in the 'Dubl. Med. Journ.,' vol. xiii; i by Mainwaring in 'Med. Facts and Observ.' for 1791 ; 3 in the 3rd vol. of ' Trans, of a Soc. for the Im- provement of Medical Science' (1808) ; 3 by Prof. Larsen in' Schmidt's Jahrb.' for 18^2 ; there is also a short notice in Wunderlich's ' Handb. d.

REPOET ON PUACTICAL MEDICINE. 46 1862, and December, 1863, was 71, or within a fraction of la per cent. It is remarkable that for about 2 montlis tiie mortality rose to 19 per cent., and this increase in the severity of the disorder was observed all over the fever wards. The mortality was, as usual, much greater among the adult and aged patients than among the young. Taking the age of 15 or 16 as the boundary line, it will be observed that among 406 cases above that age 70 died, or about 17.2 per cent.; while of the 189 cases below tliat age only i died, a child aged 6 years, admitted only to die. In the Glasgow I'ever Hospital during two years 1861, 1862, the mor- tality among 1289 cases of all ages was 17.69 per cent., or 3.4 per cent, in tlie young, and 24.1 per cent, in adults. The mortality in King's College Hospital, London, under Dr. Todd, is estimated at 25 per cent., and for the young alone at 17 per cent. Dr. Murcbison's estimate of the average mortality of typhus fever in hospitals at various places, in- cluding Glasgow, is not less than 18 per cent. Now, with reference to the diminished amount of stimulation he has lately employed, Dr. Gairdner states that between August 3rd and December 7th, 1863, there were treated 135 males and 134 females affected with typhus fever, being a total of 269 cases treated to a termination in bis wards. Of these cases 27 died, being at the rate of 10 per cent. During the whole course of tbe treatment the 269 cases consumed 633 oz. of port wine and 666 oz. of whisky, or at the rate of about 2^ oz. of wine and 2-J- oz. of spirits on an average to each patient as the allowance for his entire period of residence, which on an average was 20^ days. On the other hand, in the Glasgow Fever Hospital during the years 1861 and 1862 taken together there were 183 7 cases under treatment, although only 1694 of these were treated to a termination during the period assigned, and only 1289 were typhus. There were consumed in the two years 62,754 oz. of wine, 8440 of whiskey, and 2611 oz. of brandy. Adding the two last sums together and dividing by the number of patients, we find that each patient consumed on an average more than 34 oz. of wine and 6 oz. of spirit. But as much the largest proportion of this quantity was probably given to the 1289 cases of typhus, it is probable that the real average quantity consumed by the typhus cases may have been not less than 40 oz. of wine and 7 oz. of spirits, which would be nearly 16 times as much wine and three times as much spirit as was given to the cases in the series above referred to. AVith this much larger consump- tion of alcoholic stimulants the mortality of typhus was no less than lyi^ per cent., while under the lesser amount of stimulants it was onlj^ 10"per cent. Gairdner proceeds to state that he has long been con- vinced by carefully watched experience of individual cases, that in persons of immature age, and of temperate habits, stimulants should very rarely be administered, except in minute and expei-imental doses, rather as tonics than as stimulants in the proper sense of the term ; and possibly in some very extreme cases of collapse in more considerable quantities ; but not even then with any approach to intoxicating doses. In typhus fever Gairdner is now well assured that this A-iew is well founded, for he records the fact, that the treatment which gave only i fatal case in 189 young persons was a treatment from whicli stimulants were practically excluded, the only patient who had a little wine being

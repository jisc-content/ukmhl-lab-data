Wagel on a peculiar affection of the retina (' Centralblatt f. d. Med. "Wissenscb.,' 1864, No. 45).—The author found the following condition of both eyes in a young man of about 20; the whole of the retinal arteries from their entrance at the disc up to their minutest branches appeared as tuhite strings, which were sometimes glittering and clearly defined, sometimes of "a duller hue and with somewhat indis- tinct margins. A fine bright-red line was seen iii the middle of most of the larger strings. Here and there this red liue became somewhat larger, and where the white hue of the stripe was but little intense, the double contour of the artery could be traced, though indistinctly, as if through a haze. A very few small arterial twigs appeared normal, except that their red colour was somewhat dulled. The venous system also participated in the disease ; the larger trunks were somewhat diminished and irregular in size, and a few of their peripheral branches Tvere pbanged into wlii^^ strings. The degeneration generally stopped af;

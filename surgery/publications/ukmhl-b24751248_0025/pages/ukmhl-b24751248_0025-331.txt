Moore records some cases of accidental ivouncls of the pliarynx ('Lane.,' 1864, ii, 287).—In reference to the treatment, he considers, that " wholly, or in part, the patient should be nourished by enemata. None but the blandest food should be given by the mouth. The pain attending every act of deglutition may render this caution superfluous, but some patients may need to be advised to abstain from wliatever might irritate. Of every substance that enters the fauces a part must escape into the cellular textures or the neck, and these can only be in- jured by stimulating drinks and medicines—by brandy, or colocynth, or salt. Such matters, if required, should be administered by the rectum, whilst milk only, or such nutriments as jelly and arrowroot, which have the least solid residue when digested, should be swallowed. The quantity, also, of even these articles of food should be hmited, since it is clear that the extent of the infiltration will depend on this, as the severity of the injury will correspond with the nature of the misdirected aliment." J. Czermak, use of the laryngeal mirror in a case of foreign body ('Prag. Med. Wochenschr.,' 1864, pp. 91, 112). PALATE. M. LangenhecTc on the causes of accidental perforations in the hard palate (' Arch. fi)r khn. Chip.,' v, 95).—Wounds of the hard palate by pointed weapons, tools, &c., introduced through the mouth are com- paratively rare, because the instrument gUdes backwards along the smooth surface, merely injuring the mucous membrane, tiU it arrives at, and perhaps perforates, the upper part of the velum. Any hemor- rhage so induced may be best arrested by pressure with the finger alone, or with charpie moistened by liquor fcrri ; in other respects, such injuries are of only subordinate interest. The mucous membrane is more or less extensively torn from its attachment to the bone, and its edges usually slough ; sutures are scarcely ever indicated. Largo flaps may be kept in contact by a sponge placed in the mouth till re- union has ensued. More common are gunshot injuries; in cases of suicide the palate is

Only I deaf-mute is returned as a Jew in Ireland. The total number of cougenital deaf-mutes was 4010. In 242 in- stances the parents were related in the degrees of either first, second, third, or fourth cousins. There were 10 instances of twins, in which both children were deaf and dumb. In 3138 cases there was one mute in each family ; and this is stated to have been most generally a first child. In 357 cases there were 2 mutes in each family. In 159 in- stances 3 mutes were born of the same parents; in 36 instances 4 mutes. Thirteen families had 5 mutes each. Six mutes in a family occurred 5 times, and 7 in i case. With reference to hereditary transmission, it is remarkable that from the marriage of 91 deaf-mutes 213 children were born, only 3 of whom were mutes; and not a single instance of deaf-mutism occurred among 12 children forming three families in which both parents were deaf and dumb.

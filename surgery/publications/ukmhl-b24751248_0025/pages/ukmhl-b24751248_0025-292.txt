H. Bichersteth on a new operation for ohtaining union of an un- united fracture, with remarks on its application in certain cases of recent fracture ('Lane.,' 1864, i, 325).—"From a consideration of the cases narrated, Mr. Bickersteth proposed to treat an ununited fractm-e by passing one or more drills through the broken ends of the bone in such a manner as to secure their perfect immobility, and without making any external wound beyond that caused by the entrance of the drill. The limb should then be secured by properly adjusted splints, and kept at perfect rest. After two or three weeks the drills may be removed, and water-dressing applied to the punctures. Tor several weeks after, it would, of course, be desirable to continue the use of the splints." In replying to a criticism by W. H. B. Winchester (1. c, p. 463), Mr. Bickersteth says (1. c, p. 621):—" Mr. AViuchester urges as objections to the operation— " ist. 'The risk' which, in his opinion, 'far outbalances the success which may occasionally attend its performance.' On this subject I have simply to say that the operation has only (as far as I am aware) been performed five times, i. e. twice on the lower jaw, twice on the humerus,

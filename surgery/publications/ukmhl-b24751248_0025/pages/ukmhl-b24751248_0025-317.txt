OPERATION FOU ECTllOPIUM. 305 orbit, and Avas three quarters of an incli longer than that of the left upper lid. The edge of the lid was first separated from the orbit by an incision parallel to the former, but at a distance of 3 lines from it; it com- menced at the supra-orbital notch, and ended on the temple about 3 lines to tlie outer side of the external canthus. The deeper layers, in- cluding the fascia tarso-orbitalis, were now divided, until the edge of the lid could be placed in its normal position, care being taken not to injure the levator palpebras. The wound was now from 5 to 6 lines broad and 18 lines long; tbe flap, with wbich it was filled, had to be taken from the cheek. Union by the first intention resulted, and in 8 days the eye could be perfectly closed. After a time the flap somewhat retracted and drew the whole lid a little towards the temple. The patient was, however, quite satisfied with his condition, and would not submit to any further treatment. The greatest difliculty in the operation—that of avoiding the levator palpebr£e—was happily overcome by division of the contracted and tense fascia tarso-orbitalis close to the edge of the orbit, where, indeed, the levator is separated by fat from the fascia, and thus protected from injury. The patient was discharged on the 23rd day after the opera- tion ; he could then raise the upper lid enough to uncover the whole cornea when he was looking directly forwards. A. V.

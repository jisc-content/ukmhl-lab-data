262 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, The proportionate number of cases, in which they originate in this manner, can only be determined by very extensive ex- perience. That the stomach and bowels are disordered, during the progress of phthisis, will, I conclude; be readily ad- mitted ; and that an attention to correct such disorder is requisite, must be ac- knowledged, from what has been said rela- tive to the influence of such treatment upon various local diseases. * The actions of the heart seem to me also to become disordered from sympathy with the stomach. That palpitations, and feeble or intermitting actions of that organ, arise from this cause, is proved by their ceasing when the state of the stomach becomes changed. The palpitations which take place after eating, in cases where the heart is irritable, further evince the sympathy which exists between these organs. Sur- geons are occasionally consulted on cases # As the eighth pair of nerves supply the stomach, lungs, larynx, and pharynx, sympathetic diseases of these parts may also reasonably be expected.

AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 107 right to state as explicitly as possible to the younger part of the profession what are the curative intentions in disorders of this nature. * * After I had written the above account of the treat- ment which I had found the most successful in the cor- rection of disordered states of the digestive organs, I was much gratified by the perusal of Dr. Hamilton’s publi- cation on the Effects of Purgative Medicines. I think there is a great coincidence in the mode of treatment which I have described, and that which is sanctioned by his more extensive experience. He prescribes purgative medicines to act as eccoprotics, to excite but not to stimulate the bowels; and he combines with them gene- rally unirritating doses of mercury. Dr. Hamilton’s plan of treating these diseases also accords very much with that of M. Halle, Jo whose Memoir I have referred the reader.

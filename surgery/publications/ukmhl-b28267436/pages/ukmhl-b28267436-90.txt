70 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, by them, and upon the healthy qualities of which the clue performance of their func- tions seems to depend. This opinion is deduced immediately from the consideration of the symptoms, and confirmed by all the collateral evidence which we can collect. The duration of the affection, without fatal consequences, shows that it is a disorder of functions, and not a disease of structure. Dissections confirm the opinion. Blows which excite general irritation of the diges- tive organs produce also the symptoms which characterize the like disorder, when it arises from nervous irritation, or is ex- cited by intemperance. I doubt not but every one will, on reflection, consider the disorders of the digestive organs to be of the first importance, and will perceive the propriety of diligently enquiring into their nature, that we may know them when they exist, and that our attempts to remedy them may be conducted on rational principles. This consideration will, I trust, vindicate me for employing so much time in an in- vestigation which, perhaps, some may con- sider as tedious and unprofitable.

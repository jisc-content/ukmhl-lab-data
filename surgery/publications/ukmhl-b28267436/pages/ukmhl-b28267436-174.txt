He had had somewhat similar sores on his head and face ; but they were nearly healed, though disposed to ulcerate again. By that attention to the state of the bowels which I have described, and by dressing the sore with an aqueous solution of opium, the greater part of it was healed in the space of three weeks ; and the remainder was so much amended, and so little painful, that he had left off his opium shortly after the commencement of this treatment. As the patientâ€™s circumstances made it inconvenient to him to remain in town, he went into the country, where the sore broke out again. He then applied to a person who sold a famous diet-drink ; and before.he had taken twelve bottles, the sore was perfectly healed, and has not since broke out. The diet-drink, he says, had no sensible operation ; but his bowels became regular and comfortable, and his appetite amended by taking it.

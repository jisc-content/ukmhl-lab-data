AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 221 cation, in St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital, with success. We did not, indeed, apply the actual cautery, but the pulpy slough was moistened with undiluted nitric acid, till its putrefaction was corrected, and the living parts immediately in contact with it were destroyed. This application gave, indeed, great pain, but afterwards there was perfect ease, so that the patients were never averse to submit to means by which the constant torment which they previously endured was removed. When the surface of an ulcer became painful in a small district, and lost its healthy colour, the strong acid was ap- plied, even at the commencement of the disease, and its progress thereby pre- vented. Mr. Welbank, one of the house- surgeons, who has studied his profession with great diligence and intelligence, at whose suggestion, primarily, this practice was adopted, further observed, that the diluted acid, in the proportion of a drachm to a pint, by correcting putrefaction and exciting healthy actions, seemed to have a beneficial effect, though it caused consider- able pain.

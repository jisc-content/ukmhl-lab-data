Yet, as the local disease must be regarded as chiefly nervous, it might, in some rare instances, exist inde- pendently of any manifest disorder of those organs. I may further add, that much nervous irritation in any part generally excites vascular action. It becomes, there- fore, highly important to attend to the nature and cure of such disorder, as it might ultimately lead to the production of organic disease, which would destroy the patient. * In Doctor Cheston’s Pathological Observations, however, cases of this description are noticed.

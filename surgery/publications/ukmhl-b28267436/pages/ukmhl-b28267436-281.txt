AND TREATMENT OF LOCAE DISEASES. 261 S 3 pulmonary irritation, which might of course produce pulmonary disease, sometimes arises from disorder of the digestive or- gans*; it would be right to enquire fur- ther, whether it produces such effects, by the nervous disorder it occasions, and by its operation on the health in general; or by means of a more immediate sympathy ex- isting between the pulmonary and diges- tive organs. I do not mean to insinuate, by what has been said, that pulmonary diseases do not arise originally and idio- pathically ; but only to suggest that they may arise sympathetically, or in conse- quence of disorder of the digestive organs. * In the second part of my surgical and physiological essays, in which I related experiments made with a view to ascertain the functions of the skin, I mentioned that as it was manifest the skin and lungs were both engaged in the function of throwing forth carbonic acid gas, it followed, that when, from vicissitudes of the atmosphere or weakness of the sanguiferous organs, the circulation and secretion of the skin were much diminished, the lungs would be liable to plethora, and have to perform more than their ordinary duty, which circumstances were likely to induce irritation, and perhaps consequent disease of those organs. Those experiments, as they are not of practical importance, I shall not reprint.

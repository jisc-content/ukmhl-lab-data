AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 81 writings of L. Cornaro, who having natu- rally a weak constitution, which he seemed to have ruined by intemperance, so that he was expected to die at the age of thirty-five, did at that period adopt a strict regimen, allowing himself only twelve ounces of food daily/" By this plan of diet he lived to more than one hundred years; and it is delightful to observe the tranquil, cheerful, * I could l’elate many instances of persons who were much emaciated, some of whom were of considerable stature, becoming muscular and fat upon four ounces of the most nourishing and easily digestible food, taken three times a day. A patient lately gave me the follow- ing account of his own proceeding, with respect to diet. He said, “ When thou toldest me to weigh my food, I did not tell thee that I was in the habit of weighing myself, and that I had lost 14lbs. weight per month, for many months before I saw thee. By following thine advice I have got rid of what thou didst consider as a very formidable local malady; and upon thy allowance of food I have regained my flesh, and feel as competent to exertion as formerly, though I am not, indeed, so fat' as I used to be. I own to thee, that as I got better, I thought thy allowance was very scanty, and being strongly tempted to take more food, I did so; but I con- tinued in the practice of weighing myself, and found that I regularly lost weight upon an increased quantity of food ; wherefore I returned to that which was prescribed to me.” VOL.

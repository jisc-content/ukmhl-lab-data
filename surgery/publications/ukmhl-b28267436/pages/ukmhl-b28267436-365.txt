345 ON ANEURISMS. the digestive organs recurred, and produced the effects which I have described.* That the femoral aneurism, when it oc- curs near to the groin, may, like other aneurisms, sometimes be cured by the pro- cesses of nature, is proved by experience; yet this is not likely to be the common event of such cases. I knew two instances of patients dying of haemorrhage from such aneurisms. The sufferings both of body and mind, in these cases, were shocking. The patients were unable to move, and the distention of the integuments and pressure on the nerves occasioned great pain and irritation. The patients also lay apprehen- sive and uncertain of the hour when their sufferings might be terminated by a fearful and fatal haemorrhage. I think myself, * I saw this patient a year afterwards: he had been a vÂ°yage to South America, from whence he had returned in perfect health. He was broad-shouldered and very athletic: his legs were bowed, and equally and power- fully muscular; in short, if a painter had wished to represent a hardy tar, he could not have chosen a better subject for the portrait.

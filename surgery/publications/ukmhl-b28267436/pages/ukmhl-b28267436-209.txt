AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 189 CASE XVIII. The son of one of my friends had gradu- ally fallen into a very bad state of health. The child was about six years of age, and had been unwell for several months; when, in conclusion, two glands in the neck be- came gradually enlarged, till each had attained the size of a large walnut. The childâ€™s tongue was much furred, his appetite very deficient, and capricious; his bowels had a costive tendency ; his stools were never of a proper colour. His flesh was wasted and flabby, his countenance pale, his pulse feeble and frequent; and his general demeanour languid and irritable. I told his father that I could advise nothing as a local application better than a poultice of bread and water ; and that the chief object of at- tention was the correction of the disorder under which the child had long laboured, so that his constitution might regain its natural tranquillity and strength. Upon this subject I promised to speak to the gen- tleman who had hitherto attended the child.

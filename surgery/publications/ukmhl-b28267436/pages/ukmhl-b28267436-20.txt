PREFACE. Xll the general state of the patient’s health, because I shall have frequent occasion to refer to this subject in the succeeding parts of the work. I feel much gratified in finding, that, though a larger portion of experience has enabled me to add some new and striking © facts to this edition, it has not shown me any thing that I ought to retract or ma- terially to alter. This, indeed, must be the case in a book containing only facts, and opinions not incautiously deduced from them. Several of the papers contained in these volumes met with very general and strong objection, which I considered as the greatest compliment that could be paid to them. For if the views which I had taken of various practical subjects were different, from those of others, and were ultimately found to be correct, the greater was the necessity for their publication.

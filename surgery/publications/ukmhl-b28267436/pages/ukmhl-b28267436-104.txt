OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, 84 By drinking at proper times, thirst will be prevented at improper ones, and we shall have no temptation to fill the stomach with liquids when we have taken our food ; thus setting it afloat, and diluting the juices of the stomach, upon the agency of which its digestion entirely depends.* * The rules of diet, in dyspeptic cases, may be thus stated in an abbreviated form : â€” 1. The food should be of the most nourishing and readily digestible kind. 2. The quantity taken as a meal should not be more than it is probable the stomach will perfectly digest. 3. The meals should be taken at regular periods of six hours, three times a day : and when the stomach can digest very little food, they may be taken four times in the twenty-four hours. 4. Every meal of food should be reduced to minute sub- division and pulpy consistence by mastication, or otherwise; and suffered to remain in the stomach unmixed with liquids, in expectation that it will be dissolved by the juices of the stomach. 5. Drink should be taken four hours after each meal; allowing that time for its perfect digestion, and two hours for the conveyance of liquids from the sto- mach before the pulpy food be again received. 6. The drink then taken should not contain fermentable substances. It should be boiled water; which may be flavoured with toast, or prevented from pro- ducing a qualmish state of stomach, by pouring it upon a trivial quantity of powdered ginger. It

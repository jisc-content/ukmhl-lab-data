ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, 48 more fully of that affection of them, which I have described, as arising from causes re- cited at page 17, &c. This subject, it must be acknowledged, is very important, if it can be shown that disorders of the digestive organs are the cause of a great number of other diseases. The enquiry would then not only lead us to discover the source of many disturbances of the constitution, which originate in those of the digestive organs (for patients have no suspicion of any disorder existing in them), but would also lead to the prevention and cure of many secondary diseases of a more vexatious and sometimes of a more fatal nature, than those from which they originated. sionally saw the gentleman, whose case I have just re- lated, for twelve years afterwards, and he had no return of the affection of his bowels, though he was not in good health, and often consulted physicians, on account of irregular actions of his heart, and of renal disorder. I may mention, that it is sometimes necessary to intro- duce a varnished catheter through the stricture, in order to inject a clyster. In relating this case, I do not mean to undervalue the use of tents or bougies, which seem to do the same kind of good that they do in strictures of the urethra, and which should be employed for the same purposes upon the same principles.

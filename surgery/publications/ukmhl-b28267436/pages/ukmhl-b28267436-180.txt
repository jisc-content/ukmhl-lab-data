160 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, it might have been originally caused. The disorder of the digestive organs cannot, in many instances, be corrected, till the fretful state of the local disease is diminished. I may further mention, with relation to this subject, that I have seen patients, who scarcely ever slept from the pain of the local disease, whose stomachs were greatly disordered, and who had a distressing purging, which could only be controlled by opium, sleep without interruption dur- ing the night, regain their appetite, and have their bowels become tranquil and re- gular, when, after various trials, a dressing has at last been applied, which quieted the irritable state of the sore. It is right, how- ever, to mention, that the effects of such an application are not, in general, perma- nent : but, after a time, the sore becomes again fretful, and requires some new dress- ing to soothe or control its irritability. I have seen some cases of such diseased sores as I have described, in consultation with other surgeons, who. have become con- vinced that my opinions are well founded.

277 t 3 ON ANEURISMS. The exposure of a portion of an artery, and tying it in order to stop the current of blood into an aneurisraal sac, as proposed by Mr. Hunter, may be said to have been a new operation, at least in modern surgery. It is not therefore surprising that errors were at first committed in the mode of performing it. The haemorrhages, which took place after the operation in the first cases in which it was performed, arose from the ulceration of the artery that had been tied. The vessel in these cases was laid bare and detached in some degree from its surrounding connections, and the middle of the detached portion was tied by a single ligature. An artery thus circumstanced must necessarily inflame ; which it would do in different modes and degrees, accord- ingly as the state of the constitution, or of the part, was more or less healthy; and this inflammation produced the ulceration of the vessel.

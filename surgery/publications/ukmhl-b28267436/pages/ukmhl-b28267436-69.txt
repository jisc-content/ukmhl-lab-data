AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 49 If the tongue be furred at its back part in the morning, when there is no fever, it is reasonable to infer in general that the state of the tongue is owing to its participating in the irritation of the stomach. Such par- ticipation produces an alteration in the secretions of the tongue ; they are either de- ficient in quantity, or vitiated in quality. A state of irritation in any secreting surface, is, indeed, likely to be attended with the same consequences. It is, therefore, fair to infer, that when a general disorder of the diges- tive organs takes place, those fluids, which produce the changes that the food under- goes in them, are deficient or depraved, and consequently that digestion and the subse- quent processes must be imperfectly per- formed. The liver is likely to participate in the disorder, and the biliary secretion to be diminished or vitiated. This circum- stance admits of ocular demonstration ; and I have, therefore, considered it as an evi- dence of a more or less general disorder of the digestive organs. A very i-easonable objection may, however, be made to con- sidering the derangement of the functions VOL. i. E

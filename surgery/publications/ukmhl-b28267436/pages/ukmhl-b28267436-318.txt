About half an inch of the artery was wanting, which had been, as it were, cut out by the ligatures in the first operation. The sides of the arteries below the part which was tied were thicker than natural, and their internal surface was rough, and of a yellowish white colour. The arteria profunda was filled with coagu- lated blood, and had become reduced to less than the natural size.

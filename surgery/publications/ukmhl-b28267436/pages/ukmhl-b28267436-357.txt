337 ON ANEURISMS. saline draughts were continued, and he was directed to take five grains of the pilul. hydrarg. each night. The next day he was still better; his pulse 90, his skin moist, and his tongue cleaner ; he took food with- out disgust, though not with much appetite. As he had no evacuation from his bowels, a little opening electuary was given him, and the saline draughts were changed for the infus. ment. vitriol, with a little tinct. cardam. He had a stool in the night, which was of a light ochre colour; that is, a light brown, which dilution would not convert into a yellow. He continued the same medicines till the tenth day after the operation, with an evident amendment in his health ; though the alvine discharges, which we contrived to procure daily, were still of the colour above described, though somewhat deeper. On the tenth day, after observing his tongue and pulse, &c. those who saw him joined with me in opinion, that he was in better health than when he was admitted into the hospital. vol. 1. z

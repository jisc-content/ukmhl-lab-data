238 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, tlie worst case, and that which I have hap- pened to meet with most rarely, there is, I think, reason to suppose that some of the discharge from the urethra has been acci- dentally applied to the surface of the eye. This circumstance may be inferred from the copious and puriform discharge which takes place from the conjunctiva, which is con- tinued for about three weeks, and from the disease not yielding to any remedies which usually relieve other ophthalmies. The milder, and, to me, more commonly occur- ring case, seems to be the result merely of irritability of constitution. With relation to this subject I may mention, that I know a patient who has several times had dis- charge from the urethra and inflamed eyes alternating with each other, and both ap- parently arising from constitutional causes. I shall also add the following striking instance of ophthalmy connected with go- norrhoea, in which the inflammation of the eyes can neither be supposed to be the effect of local contamination nor of metas- tasis.

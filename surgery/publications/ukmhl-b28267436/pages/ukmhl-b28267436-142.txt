122 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, Cases, like those which have been related, are not, if I may judge from my own ex- perience, at all uncommon. They suffi- ciently prove, in my opinion, that local nervous disorders and muscular debility may arise from a general disorder of the health, in which the digestive organs are chiefly affected. This disorder, as has been stated in the preliminary observations, may, sometimes, be the cause, and sometimes the consequence, of the nervous affection. In either case, however, its correction is of high importance in the medical treatment of the disease. In the fifth and sixth cases, a disorder of the digestive organs must, I think, be allowed to be the cause of the nervous affection, from the sudden and complete cessation of the latter, when the cure of the former was accomplished. De- cisive instances like these are particularly valuable; they show that great nervous disorder may be produced by that of the digestive organs, and, consequently, how much the latter disorder is likely to aggra- vate the former, when it occurs even secondarily as its effect. I have seen a

ON ANEURISMS. 818 ation of this collection is, that the blood had burst its way from the aneurismal sac in the vacancy between the muscles just mentioned; after which it would readily and extensively separate the peritonaeum in the manner described. I am inclined to attribute to this circumstance the unde- finable disturbance of health which the poor patient suffered during the week pre- ceding the operation. It may, perhaps, excite surprise that this collection did not become putrid. No particular account can be given of the aneurismal sac beneath Poupartâ€™s liga- ment, since it and the contiguous parts had sloughed in consequence of the irritation of the putrid blood. A small aperture had been made by this sloughing in the front of the orbicular ligament of the hip-joint, and a small extent of the thigh-bone was, by the same cause, deprived of its perios- teum. A bougie was passed from the lower end of the femoral artery into the sac.

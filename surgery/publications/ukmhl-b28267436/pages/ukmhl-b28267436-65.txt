AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 45 out apparently producing any injurious con- sequences. To chemical changes we may probably attribute the extrication of inflam- mable air, and the various and unhealthy odours of the faecal matter, which are ob- servable in disordered states of the digestive viscera. The means by which this modification of the residue of the food, which takes place in the large intestines, is effected, are but little known. Analogy leads us to refer it to the effects of a secretion from the lining of those intestines in which it occurs. Now if this secretion deviates from the healthy state, in consequence of an irritated or dis- ordered condition of those organs, we may reasonably expect a corresponding failure of the process, by which the residue of the food is converted into faeces ; and, conse- quently, great irritation will be excited in the lower bowels by their putrefying con- tents, which may produce especial disease in them.* t*' * The public attention has of late been much directed, by Mr. White of Bath and others, to the numerous

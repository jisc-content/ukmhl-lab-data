AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 33 It has been said, in the brief and general recital that has been given of the symp- toms which characterize disorder in the chylopoietic organs, that the stools are of an unnatural colour and odour. Medical men entertain various opinions respecting the colour of the feces ; to me this pro- perty seems generally to depend on the kind and quantity of the bile. All the healthy secretions, which are poured into the alimentary canal, except the bile, are colourless or white; if, therefore, this fluid were wanting, the residue of the aliment would be of the colour which might be expected to result from its undigested parts combined together. When, for in- stance, the secretion of bile is stopped by the irritation of teething in children, whose diet is chiefly bread and milk, the feces are white; when this secretion is obstructed in adults, the stools are pale, like whitish- brown paper. suppressed, very deficient, or much depraved, it does not appear that the nutrition of the body is defective. A further account of the digestive processes may be found in the fourth of the Physiological Lectures, de- livered before the College of Surgeons, in 1817. VOL. T. D

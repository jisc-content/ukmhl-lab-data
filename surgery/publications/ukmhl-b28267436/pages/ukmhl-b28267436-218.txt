198 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, the rational is to the empirical practice of medicine. That erysipelatous inflammation is the consequence of a disturbed state of the system, caused or maintained by disorder of the digestive organs, and that this in- flammation is curable by means which cor- rect the latter disorder, could be proved by numerous and indisputable cases ; yet it is not necessary to adduce them, because the public opinion seems already decided on this subject. If, then, numerous and veTy dissimilar diseases may result from the same causes, is it not probable that they are adequate to produce every variety? It must, however, be admitted, that there may be hereditary predispositions to cer- tain diseased actions. We have instances of gout occurring in very early childhood; and it is also highly probable that unhealthy states of the circulating fluids may conduce to excite peculiar morbid actions.

I then passed two ligatures under it by means of an eyed probe, and drawing- one of them upwards, and the other downwards, as far as the space would permit, I tied them firmly. The upper ligature was about half an inch from the os pubis, and the lower one the same dis- tance from the arteria profunda, which vessel I had distinctly felt before I tied the ligatures. There are, perhaps, few situations of aneu- rism where the artery can be tied so separ- ately and distinctly as here; the pulsation directs the surgeon to the precise situation of the vessel; and if he only keeps suffi- ciently close to its sides when he passes the ligature round, neither the vein nor the nerve can be included. I did not divide the artery between the two ligatures: it was suggested that it were better not to do so ; and I knew that I could obtain all the ad- vantages of a relaxed state of the vessel, by merely bending the thigh upon the pelvis. The patient did not, after the operation, suffer any kind of pain from the wounded VOL. i. u

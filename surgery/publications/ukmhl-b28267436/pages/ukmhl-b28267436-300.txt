ON ANEURISMS. 280 vessels on the surface of the stump con- tinue to possess all their natural sur- rounding connections, whilst they are left in a lax state, in consequence of their division. To accomplish this object in cases of aneurism, I propose that the operation should be performed in the following man- ner : â€” The operator should divide the immediate coverings of the artery, till he has fairly exposed its external elastic coat. When he can touch the bare vessel, he will not find any difficulty in separating from it, by means of his finger and thumb, or the blunt edge of an aneurismal needle, the cellular substance that connects it to the contiguous parts. This part of the opera- tion is not painful, and should be per- formed slowly. The firm sides of the ves- sel enable the surgeon clearly to distin- guish its surface, and by keeping the finger in exact contact with it, a passage may be made completely round the artery. Care should be taken not to elevate the ar- tery more than can be possibly avoided,

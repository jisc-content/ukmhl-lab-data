ON ANEURISMS. 321 become diffused, it might not be right at the time of the operation to open the aneu- rismal bag, and remove the blood. I should, however, be inclined to postpone this at- tempt ; for, perhaps, no necessity might exist, as putrefaction might not take place. A few days will determine the degree of life of the limb, and would make a wound less likely to ulcerate or slough.

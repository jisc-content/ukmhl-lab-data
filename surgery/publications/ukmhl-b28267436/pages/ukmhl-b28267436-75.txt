AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 55 e 4 been verified by every observation I have made), that a state of irritation leads to those diseased vascular actions, which produce an alteration of structure in the irritated parts. However, where the disordered state of the bowels had been of longer duration, I have found the villous coat of the intestines tumid, turgid with blood, and apparently inflamed, and sometimes ulcerated; and these appearances have been most manifest in the large intestines. Having observed repeatedly in dissections of these cases, that the large intestines were more diseased than the small ones, it occurred to me that the fact might be accounted for in the following manner: If digestion is incomplete, the undigested food must be liable to chemical changes, and the products resulting from this cause are likely to be most stimulating to the large intestines. Indeed, in ad- vanced stages of this "disorder, mucus and jelly tinged with blood are discharged", and it seems probable that a kind of chronic dysentery may be thus induced.

333 ON ANEURISMS. A similar operation has lately been per- formed by Mr. Frere of Birmingham, with success. The patient being healthy, the wound healed without difficulty. Mr. Tomlinson of Birmingham also per- formed a similar operation with equal suc- cess ; so that it seems proved that the external iliac artery may be tied, in the case of a femoral aneurism, with as little detriment to the limb as occurs from tying the femoral artery in a case of popliteal aneurism. I lately saw the woman who was the subject of the last case which I have related, and there is no distinguishable difference in the size or strength of the two extremities. CASE IV. .T. Peterson, a Swedish sailor, about forty years of age, was admitted into St. Bartho- lomewâ€™s Hospital, on accountof an aneurism of the femoral artery, just below the groin. He was a thin man, but had strong muscles.

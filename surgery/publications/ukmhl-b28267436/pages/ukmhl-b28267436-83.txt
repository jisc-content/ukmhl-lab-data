General nervous irritation may have preceded the disorder of the stomach and bowels, or may have been caused by it. The history will generally show, that the derangement of the digestive organs is secondary. When it arises from local irritation, it can be produced only through the medium of' the sensorium. When it is idiopathic, it frequently origin- ates in causes which affect the nervous system primarily ; such as anxiety, too great exertion of mind or body, and impure air.

Nervous irritability and weakness are not perhaps susceptible of a direct cure by me- dicine ; but the disorders of the digestive organs are more corrigible by medical re- medies. In practice, these require our chief attention ; and if their disorders be cor- rected, all nervous irritation frequently ceases, and health is restored. In many instances the nervous irritation, which has induced the disease, is trivial, and would

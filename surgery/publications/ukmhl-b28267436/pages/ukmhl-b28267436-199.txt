AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 179 size. I was unable at first to account for this despondency under such favourable circumstances ; but I soon discovered that it was the effect of hypochondriacism. For his tongue was much furred and dry ; and, at the same time that he left off the band- age, he had also discontinued his medi- cines. I urged him to return to them immediately; and called on him again in ten days, when he perceived clearly the absurdity of his late despondency, as well as its cause. He called on me on the 10th of July, with a new swelling near the upper part of the tibia, which threatened to form an abscess similar to those which had for- merly taken place. I covered the limb with the bandage of sticking-plaster, as at first. The new disease disappeared en- tirely ; and the old ones were so much benefited by the exact and equal pressure, that the patient felt no difference between the sound and the affected limb. The ulcers gradually healed, and his health is better than it has been for some years; yet still there is an evident tendency to dis- order of the digestive organs. n 2

12 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, I could relate numerous cases in support of the inferences which I have drawn from the preceding history ; that local irritation acting on the nervous system may affect the digestive organs in a very serious man- ner, and thereby create great disorder of the whole constitution, which is afterwards alleviated in proportion to the amendment that ensues in the state of those viscera. Such consequences of great local irritation must frequently occur to every one; it is therefore unnecessary to adduce more instances to support the opinions here delivered. formed where no strangulation existed. See Pott’s works, vol.iii. pp. 295. 299. edition of 1783. The operation in the case just related was undertaken upon the authority of these cases, which were both suc- cessful. I performed a similar operation on a patient whose life had been twice in imminent hazard from strangulation in a case of adherent epiplocele, in which a truss did not keep up the hernia, and the operation was followed by violent peritonitis, which could only be sub- dued by such copious and repeated vensesection as en- dangered the patient’s life. These two cases have made such an impression on my mind, that I should be very averse in future to undertake similar experiments.

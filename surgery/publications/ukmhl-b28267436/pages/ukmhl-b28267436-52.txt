The difficulty of conceiving that the two fluids can be agitated together by the peristaltic motion of the intestines, without becoming incorporated, has led to an opinion that the bile may combine with the alimentary matter, and lose its original properties; but nothing of this kind is ascertained. Fourcroy thinks that the alkali and saline ingredients of the bile may combine with the chyle, and render it more fluid, while its gelatinous and resinous parts may combine with the excrementitious matter. It is, indeed, evident, that the bile combines either totally or partially with something separated from the chyle, and exists formally in it, and in a state of health uniformly dyes it of its peculiar colour; and therefore it has of late been supposed, that the bile may serve to purify the chyle, by precipitating and combining with its feculent parts.* * In the enquiry into the probable uses of the bile, it ought to be observed, that in many persons, in whom that secretion is either for a considerable time wholly

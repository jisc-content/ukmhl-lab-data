ON ANEURISMS. 297 From this ligature to the place where the vessel had formerly been tied, the artery was so closely connected with the surround- ing substance, that dissection was required to separate them. The parts of the artery from which the former ligatures had separ- ated were about half an inch asunder, and the canal of the vessel appeared perfectly open.â€”The whole of the vessels from the bifurcation of the aorta, to the aperture in the tendon of the triceps muscle, were now removed, and carefully dissected ; and after being stuffed, and hardened by spirits, they were cut open to show the state of them internally. A coagulum of blood, about two inches long, was found above the part where the last ligature was made. At what time this coagulum had been formed is perhaps difficult to ascertain : it did not seem to have taken place after death, for above it the artery contained no blood ; and if it had occurred immediately after the operation, it is probable that it would have prevented the haemorrhage. I have already remarked that the man did not bleed for some time previous to his death ;

No marks of disease were discoverable in the aorta, or in the internal iliac artery. The external iliac was covered by a great number of lymphatic glands, which pre- vented it from being readily distinguished; yet when separated from these, it did not appear diseased. For nearly two inches above the part which was tied, the lymph- atic glands covering the artery were consi- derably enlarged, having no doubt become additionally swollen from the irritation excited by the ligature. The external sur- face of one of them next the wound had ulcerated; and the ulceration penetrated through the gland, and communicated with the artery, as was afterwards made evident by slitting open that vessel. It was through this aperture that the blood had escaped ; for the ligature still remained firm upon that part of the artery which it had inclosed.

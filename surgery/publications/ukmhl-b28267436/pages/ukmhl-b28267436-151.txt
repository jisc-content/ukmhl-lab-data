AND TREATMENT OR LOCAL DISEASES. 1SI k 2 mis, I wish to propose, as a question, What is the state of the bowels between the in- fliction of the injury and the occurrence of that dreadful malady ? * * All the experience which I have had relative to the treatment of tetanus, since the first publication of these observations, has convinced me that more benefit is ob- tained by correcting the errors of the digestive organs than by any other means. Il may probably be useful to insert one case as a striking proof of this fact. A man, who had been wounded in the foot, but not badly, was brought, about ten days after the accident, to the admis- sion-room of the hospital, and so violent and general were the spasms, that it was scarcely expected he could be taken to his bed alive. The jaw was fast clenched, and the muscles of his back and belly rigid. Convulsive actions came on frequently, and then all his limbs were violently affected. His bowels had not been relieved for many days. A grain of calomel and ten of jalap mixed with treacle, were given every fourth hour. It seemed also necessary to give him opium to mitigate his spasms, but it was mixed with an equal quantity of calomel. When, after twenty hours, his bowels were purged, the discharges were not like faeces, and so ex- tremely offensive, that the patient could not stay in the ward. From this time, however, there was so complete a subsidence of the spasms that no more opium was ne- cessary; and the patient recovered, seemingly in pro- portion <is the digestive organs regained their healthy functions. Such cases as I have related in this section, with others that it would be foreign to my present purpose to men-

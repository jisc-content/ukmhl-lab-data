AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 173 tinned to discharge; each aperture fretting out into a foul sore.

A probe introduced into one of these, near the bottom of the tibia, could be moved upwards and downwards along the surface of the bone, which was not, however, denuded. From an upper ulcer the probe could be passed behind the bone, and under the muscles of the calf: this, indeed, seemed to be the original seat of the abscess, from which the sinuses proceeded to their dif- ferent outlets.

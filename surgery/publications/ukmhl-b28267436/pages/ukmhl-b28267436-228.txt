SOS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, ceous stools of a greenish-brown colour are discharged from the bowels in the course of the night, and the patientâ€™s feelings un- dergo an entire revolution. Before this, the stools procured by medicine were watery and dark coloured. The patient now sleeps like one long harassed by pain and watching; his stomach is tranquil, and willingly receives aliment, which now pro- duces no uneasy sensations. The skin, which had been hot and dry, becomes moistened with a gentle perspiration, and the pulse beats with its natural frequency, and in a tranquil manner. The effects of this favourable crisis being maintained by medical treatment, the sloughs are thrown off, and the sore heals with a rapidity in- dicative of considerable vigour of consti- tution ; and further demonstrative of the sloughing not having been the effect of vas- cular weakness, but of nervous irritation. I could relate numerous cases of erysipela- tous inflammation terminating in sloughing, in which the disease arose from a similar constitutional cause.

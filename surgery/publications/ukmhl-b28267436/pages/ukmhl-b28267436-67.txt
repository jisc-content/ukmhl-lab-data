AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 47 order to facilitate the forming a judgment relative to those circumstances which in- dicate their disorder, I return to speak dicular direction, his daily disquiet and labour were renewed. I recommended the patient to take a dessert- spoonful of castor-oil every night, in order to excite the bowels to carry down the fecal matter in a state likely to pass the stricture, and also to take five grains of the pilul. hydrarg. every second night. I advised him further to throw up as much thin gruel and oil as he could get to ascend ever)' morning before he rose from his bed, in order to liquefy the focal matter, and facili- tate its passage.

He said he felt the clyster fill the lower part of his bowel, and gradually ascend through the stricture, and then he pumped up a little more, till by degrees so much had been ejected as to create an uncontrollable desire to evacuate the bowels.

18 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, the liver are either suspended, diminished, or vitiated. The bowels are either purged or costive, and the faeces fetid. The faecal matter is often mixed with mucous and other secretions. There is also frequently a very troublesome cough. Such symptoms generally subside when the local irritation ceases ; but sometimes the disorder of the digestive organs, thus excited, continues and disturbes the general health of the patient. If local irritation be capable of disorder- ing the bowels, it seems natural to conclude that it acts upon them through the medium of the brain. If also the brain and nervous system should be disordered, without any apparent local disease, similar derangements may be expected to take place in the func- tions of the digestive organs. In cases, where some morbific poison has been ab- sorbed, producing effects similar to those of syphilis, we usually find the irritation of the constitution which ensues to be accom- panied with this slighter disorder of the chylopoietic organs.

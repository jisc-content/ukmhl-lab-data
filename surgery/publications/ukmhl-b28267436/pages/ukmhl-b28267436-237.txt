The patientâ€™s health had, however, considerably improved during this interval, and I now resolved to make gentle pressure on the skin surrounding the disease, by strips of plaster applied like the many-tailed band- age, in order to prevent the peculiar inflam- mation, or turgid state of vessels which preceded the mortification, from occurring in the circumference. The sore and sloughs were washed with water slightly acidulated with nitric acid: then dusted over with flour, to absorb the discharges, and covered with simple dressings. The limb was then bandaged with sticking plaster and a calico roller. The result of this treatment ex- ceeded my expectations, for no farther extension of the disease took place. The sloughs slowly separated, leaving beneath them a healthy ulcer, which even rapidly healed. The patient returned into the country, and had no recurrence of this dis- ease ; yet did not survive it more than two years.

68 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, observes that a similar state of those organs is found in other diseases ; namely, dropsy, hypochondriasis, accompanied with diffi- culty of breathing and palpitation, obsti- nate coughs, and a great number of very different diseases ; to all of which the same treatment is applicable. That the extremely prejudicial consequences of disorders of the stomach and bowels have been noticed at all times by persons of observation, and particularly by those who are in the habit of judging of their state by their excre- tions, is sufficiently evident. The ancients sought to correct the error by purging with hellebore, and the moderns by more com- pound purges, to use the words of M. Halle, par le melange des purgatifs resineux et des mercuriaux. I have not, however, met with any physiological investigation of the nature of these diseases, nor of the rational objects of cure. It is to promote such an investigation, that I have laid before the public the facts which have come under my observation, and the reflections to which they have given rise.

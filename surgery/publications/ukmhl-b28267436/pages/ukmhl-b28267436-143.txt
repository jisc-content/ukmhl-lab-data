AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 123 considerable number of such cases, which I cannot relate with precision, because I had not sufficient opportunities of observing the patients, to enable me to note the progress of the disease with accuracy. Of these I can only observe, in general terms, that I have seen several instances of pain, imbecility, and wasting of the muscles in one of the lower extremities, which were considered as the effect of disease about the hip-joint; yet the event proved that there was no organic affection of that part. The complaint was connected with that state of constitution which I have described, and was amended as the health in general improved. I have also seen several instances of wasting of the muscles of one of the upper extremi- ties in children : so much, indeed, were the muscles shrunk, that the bones and joints could be as distinctly examined as in a skeleton. The local affection in these cases came on suddenly. I lately saw a little boy, who had an attack of this kind in his left arm several years ago, and on whose case I was at that time consulted.

Having, however, only a common needle with which to pass the ligature, I several times withdrew the point, from the appre- hension of wounding the vein. * After having tied the artery about an inch and a half above Poupartâ€™s ligament, I divided that part, and thus laid the new and the former wound into one. I traced as well as I could, with my finger, the continuation of the artery, from the place where the ligature was now made, to that where it was * It would be, I think, an useful addition to our sur- gical instruments for such purposes, to have needles made with handles of pure, and, consequently, flexible silver, and with steel points that have edges just sharp enough to pass through the cellular substance; but neither so pointed nor so sharp as to endanger the wounding any parts of consequence that may be con- tiguous to those round which they are passed. When the points of these instruments were once passed under- neath the vessel, the surgeon could bend their handles so as to accommodate them to the space they have to turn in, and thus avoid an inconvenience which, I believe, most surgeons must have experienced ; I mean, the great difficulty of turning a common needle in a deep and narrow wound.

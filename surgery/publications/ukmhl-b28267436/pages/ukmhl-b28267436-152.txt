132 ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN, tion, have impressed the opinion on my mind, that dis- orders of the digestive organs may originally cause, or may secondarily aggravate, a nervous disorder; and pro- duce, as has been “ mentioned, in the nervous system, a diminution of the functions of the brain: or a state of excitation causing delirium, partial nervous inactivity, and insensibility; or the opposite state of irritation and pain : in the muscular system, weakness, tremors, and palsy, or the contrary affections of spasms and convul- sions.” Could these circumstances be proved, it would be scarcely necessary to add, that those painful affections of parts, to which, perhaps, some predisposition exists, may be excited in a similar manner: such as gout and rheumatism. Indeed, rheumatic pains are very usually concomitant upon that state of constitution which existed in the patients whose cases I am relating. No considerable progress could, however, be expected to be made in the study of the origin of sympathetic dis- eases, whilst the brain was regarded as the sole source or centre of the nervous energy. Now that the experi- ments of M. le Gallois have extended our knowledge of the nervous system, and shown that the different por- tions of the medulla spinalis form also centres from which the nervous actions of corresponding parts of the body proceed, and to which they tend, considerable increase of knowledge is likely to result from attentive observation and accurate dissections. It is in my opinion sufficiently evident, that disorders of the digestive organs sometimes affect the different portions of the medulla spinalis, and produce sympathetic disorders of the body and limbs without operating through the medium of the brain, as was formerly supposed. A female patient, about 27 years of age, was lately admitted into the hos- pital with paralysis of the arm, which had come on sud-

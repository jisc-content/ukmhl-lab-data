AND TREATMENT OF LOCAL DISEASES. 43 I conclude this review of the opinions entertained respecting chylification, by ob- serving, that if the succus intestinalis be an agent in this function, disorder of the intes- tines is likely to affect its secretion, and thus impede this second important part of the process of assimilation. The residue of the alimentary matter, mixed with the bile, passes from the small into the large intestines, and there under- goes a sudden change; it acquires a pecu- liar foetor, and becomes what we denominate faeces. This change is so sudden, that it cannot be ascribed to spontaneous chemical alterations (which would be gradual), but it must be attributed to some new animal agency. If the contents of the small intes- tines at their termination, and of the large at their commencement, be examined, they will be found totally different, even within a line of each other; the former being without foetor, and the latter being in all respects what is denominated faeces. Though chemists, then, might speak of the feculent matter of chyle as feces, yet physiologists

The Pericardium.—The pericardium is a fibro- serous sac which envelops the heart. The fibrous portion is pyramidal in shape, and at its base is firmly attached to the central tendon of the diaphragm and the adjoining muscular substance; above it is continued as a tubular prolongation on to the root of the aorta and pulmonary artery, and is gradually lost in the connective tissue of their external coats. The serous membrane lining the sac, termed the parietal layer of pericardium, passes up to the root of the great vessels, which it envelops in a common sheath for an inch to an inch and a half from their origin, and is thence reflected on to the surface of the heart, which it closely invests, 26

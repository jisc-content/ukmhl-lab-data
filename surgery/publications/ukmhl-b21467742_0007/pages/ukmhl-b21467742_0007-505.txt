487 PHYSIOGNOMY AND EXPRESSION Control through Senses.—Good capacity ; but sometimes listens and looks about instead of seeing the blackboard or map demonstration. At times starts or fidgets when spoken to. Muscle Sense. — Appreciates and compares weights in the hands well; knows coins by feeling them. Estimates dimensions better by feeling with the hands than at sight. Compound Cerebration. — Physical exercises well performed; can lead the class without being guided. Proceeds systematically to ex- amine and describe a flower as previously taught. Generally repeats a lesson correctly. Betentiveness.—Memory really good ; but for- gets where to find things from not looking to see when putting them away; can retain facts learnt, but does not always use them aright. Co-07-dination. — Imitates hand movements well, but is not quite accurate; such action is often accompanied by some extra-movements. Speaks well. Good at games. Spreading Area.-—Extra-movements with the pen are seen before writing ; while at times the fingers twitch on the pen. The head often turns upwards while thinking, or is held on one side when speaking, or when the hands are held out. She tends to laughter and talkativeness. Sometimes there is confusion in replies; facts of history are remembered, but given in the wrong- place. Response.—Quick both in action and in words ; generally without a pause for thinking. C. Physical Health and Nutrition.—Not pale, but a little thin for her stature ; weight 98 lbs. Average weight for age is 100'32 lbs.: but this child is a little above the average height; further, she has probably not yet com- pleted her growth, which last year increased by 1"75 inches, as against an average of 1"57 for her age, while weight increased only 8 lbs. as compared with the average, which is 9'14 lbs. School Report.—In disposition affectionate ; sometimes loses self-control, and is emotional or passionate. Physiologry. PAET I.—The Tissues and Neuro-muscular Mechanism 1. Protoplasm ..... 488 II.

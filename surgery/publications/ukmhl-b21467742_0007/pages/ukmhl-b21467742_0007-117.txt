It is a vertical coronal section through the nasal cliambers and maxillary antra on the jilane of the antral orifices, through each of which an arrow jiasses into the infundibulum. The close relation of the frontal, anterior ethmoidal, and maxillary sinuses to the orbit is also seen. The com- munication between the anterior ethmoidal cells and the turbinal cell on the right side with the middle meatus of the nose is indicated by arrows. Vol. VII. Plate I. Tn face paae lOo.

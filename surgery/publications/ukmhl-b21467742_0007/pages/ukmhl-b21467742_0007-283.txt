265 PARALYSIS Paralysis. Paralysis is a symptom, not a disease. The present section deals with the so-called system lesions of the cord, and other diseases of the grey and white matter. Tabes dorsalis is treated separately in a later volume. Allied disorders are considered in the section on " Muscles and Myasthenia Gravis" in vol. vi., and in the section on " Spinal Cord" in a later volume. A general index of the nervoiis system will be found in this volume, p. 33. Paralysis Introduction . . . . . .26-5 I. Spastic Paralysis . . . .268 1.

The term " paralysis" is that commonly em- ployed to denote loss of motor power, irrespective of the amount of the defect, though theterm"par- esis " is sometimes applied to the lesser degrees of impairment of movement, while "paralysis" is reserved for the more pronounced defects. The power of performing movements may be diminished or abolished in consequence of lesions of the sensori-motor region of the cortex of the brain, of any part of the motor path from this region to the pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord, of the nuclei of motor cranial nerves, of the anterior horns of the spinal cord, of the peripheral nerves, and even of the muscles themselves. In addition to which there may be definite paralysis without its being possible to discover structural changes in any of the parts that have just been enumerated. Paralysis may be acute or chronic, and the

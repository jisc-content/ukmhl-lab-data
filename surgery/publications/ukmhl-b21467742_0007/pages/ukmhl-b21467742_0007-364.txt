PARASITES 346 Fasciola hepatica, var. angusta (Railliet, 1895). — One example, 25 mm. long, expec- torated by a patient. Railliet regards it as a variety of F. hejxitica, but Blanchard con- cludes that it is identical with F. gigantea, which was discovered by Cobbold (1854) in the liver of a giraffe. Dicrocoelium lanceolatmn (Rudolphi, 1803); Syn. : Distomum lanceolatmn (Rudolphi, 1803). —The body is lancet-shaped, 8-10 mm. long and l*5-2'5 mm. broad. The ventral sucker is situated behind the anterior at a distance equal to one-fifth of the length of the worm. The genital pore is situated in the median line between the suckers. The eggs are dark brown, 4045 IK long, 22-30 /a broad, and have an operculum. The developmental cycle is im- perfectly known. According to some the larval stage is passed in Planorhis marginatus. The adult trematode is a fairly common parasite in the bile-ducts of the sheep and ox, and is usually associated with Fasciola hepatica. It has also been found in some other animals, and there are seven recorded cases in which it has been found in the bile-ducts of man in Egypt, Germany, Italy, etc. Distomum oculi huniani (Amnion, 1833); Syn. : D. ophthalmohium (Diesing, 1850).— Four examples were found beneath the capsule of the lens in a child in Dresden, and are regarded as immature forms of some other species. Opjisthorchis felineus (Rivolta, 1885); Syn. : Distomum felineum (Rivolta, 1885); D. conus (Gurlt, 1831); D. sihiriciim (Winogradoff, 1892).—It is 8-18 mm. long, 1 •5-2-5 mm. broad, flattened, of a pinkish colour, and very trans- parent. The two CcBca or limbs of the intestine are often filled with brown contents; the genital pore is just in front of the ventral sucker, the eggs are oval, 26-30 /x in their longest diameter, and have an operculum. Little is yet known in regard to the development of this species, but the definite host is supposed to be infected by ingestion of infected fish. Although the parasite has been found in various animals, it is most frequent in the cat, and inhabits the bile-ducts, causing their dilatation and more or less general cirrhosis of the liver. It is also parasitic in man ; in Tomsk it has been found in nine cases, Winogradofi' (1892) finding it eight times in a total of 124 autopsies. In none of the cases had the parasite caused the death of the patient, but in each instance had caused dilatation of the bile-ducts, thickening of their walls, cirrhosis and atrophy of the liver tissue, and in some cases there was jaundice and ascites. In many parts of the world this trematode is common in the cat. In Konigsberg Braini found that 80 per cent were infected, and he therefore suggested that further instances of its occurrence in man would probably be recorded. The only case observed in Europe since then is that recorded by Askanazy (1900) in East Prussia, wbilst in one other case the same writer found the eggs of this parasite. There is thus a total of eleven cases, the patients in each instance having been of the male sex. Ojnsthorchis conjunctus (Cobbold, 1859); Syn.: Distomum conjunctum (Cobbold, 1859) is a small lancet-shaped trematode, about 10 mm. long and 2"5 mm. broad; its whole surface is covered with small spines. The genital pore is just anterior to the ventral sucker. The eggs are 34 fx. long, 20 //, broad, and have an operculum. The developmental cycle is yet unknown. This species was ob- tained by Cobbold from an American fox, by T. R. Lewis (1872) from pariah dogs in India, and by M'Connell (1875-78) from two Moham- medans in Calcutta. It was found in the dilated and inflamed bile-ducts. Opisthorchis sinensis (Cobbold, 1875); Syn.: Distomum sinense (Cobbold, 1875); Distomum spiathulatum (Leuckart, 1876); etc. — It is lanceolate, 10-18 mm. long, 2-3 mm. broad, of a reddish colour and very transparent. The ventral sucker is situated behind the oral sucker, at a distance equal to one-quarter of the length of the body. The genital pore is just in front of the ventral sucker. The dark brown eggs measure 25-30 fx. long, 15-17 jx broad, and have an operculum. The inter- mediate host is not yet known. This parasite was found by M'Connell in Calcutta in 1874, large numbers being seen blocking the bile- ducts of a Chinese patient. It has also been found in Mauritius, Corea, and more especially in Tonquin and Japan. Bajlz (1883) first drew attention to its frequency in Japan, in some districts of which the disease due to the parasite is endemic, being characterised by dilatation of the bile-ducts and hepatic cirrhosis, and not infrequently causing the death of the patient. Opisthorchis Buski (Lankester, 1857); Syn.: Distomum Buski (Lankester, 1857); Distomum crassum (Busk, 1859).—It is oval, 4-8 cm. long and 1-4-2 cm. broad. The ventral sucker is about 3 mm. behind the oral sucker, and the genital pore is between them. The eggs are 125 /A long and 75 fi broad, with an operculum. The mode of development is unascertained. The parasite has been found in about half a dozen cases in the faeces, small intestine, gall- bladder, and bile-ducts of native Chinese or of those who have dwelt in China. 02nsthorchis Rathouisi (Poirier, 1887); Syn.: Distomum Rathouisi (Poirier, 1887). — This species, which is regarded as probably identical with that last mentioned, was first found by Rathouis in the fteces of a Chinese subject, and was recorded by Poirier in 1887. Mesogonimus heterojihyes (v. Siebold, 1852); Syn.: Distomum heterophyes (v. Siebold, 1852) is oval, 1-1-5 mm. in length, 0-7 mm. in breadth,

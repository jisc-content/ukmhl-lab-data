PHYSIOGNOMY AND EXPRESSION 481 of the bones composing it have the greatest interest. The head and the brain grow rapidly in early life. In the infant at birth the head has an average circumference of 13 "95 inches in the male and 13'75 in the female, increasing to about 17"5 inches at nine months and 19"0 inches at twelve months, continuing to grow until it becomes 20 or 21 inches in circumference at seven years of age. In form the general contour of the head is rounded; the forehead should be smooth, without frontal ridge or contraction between the temples. The greatest transverse diameter is between the centres of the parietal bones behind the ears, and at a higher level than their insertion. The anterior f ontanelle enlarges with the growth of the head till about the eighth month, then becoming gradually closed by growth of the frontal and parietal bones, so that it is hardly to be felt after the first year. The head should be viewed both full face and in profile. It may best be felt by placing the open hand on the head, with the thenar and hypothenar eminences resting on the forehead, so that the extended fingers, lying on the surface, may feel the general form and volume, as well as any irregularities in ossification. Measurements may be taken with a tape at the largest circumference, transversely from one meatus to the other, over the top of the head, and again, antero-posteriorly in the median line from the root of the nose to the occipital pro- tuberance. The size, the growth in a period of time, and to some extent the configuration or proportions of the head, are thus observed. The most important information to be gained is as to the size and content of the brain-case ; next to this the conditions of ossification are of great interest, and these—if we exclude those Cranium defective, including all cases below —2334 boys, 1659 girls. Cranium Large.—A head of 22 inches circum- ference or over may be considered large in any school child ; allowance must be made for age. Hydrocephalus was not here included ; doubt- less many cases were rachitic—364 boys, 59 girls. Cranium Squall.—The point of size is recorded as apart from the height of the child—476 boys, 1245 girls. Cranium Bossed.—There may be bosses, pro- tuberances, or outgrowths at the site of the ossific centres of the frontal and parietal bones —818 boys, 174 girls. Forehead Defective.—The forehead may be narrow, shallow in vertical measurement, or small in all dimensions; it may bulge forward and overhang. All defects of forehead except " bosses " and " frontal ridge " are here included. Interfrontal Ridge.—The verticle suture be- tween the two halves of the frontal bone may be the site of a bony ridge, present in all degrees; if the forehead is also narrow, it forms the scapho-cephalic type which is the worst form of cranial development—210 boys, 46 girls. Four principal types of head may be mentioned : dolicho-cephalic or long head ; oxy- cephalic or the elevated head; brachy-cephalic or broad headed ; and micro-cephalic, with a circumference below 17 inches after the second year. Dr. Arthur Macdonald says: " Bright girls have a larger percentage of long-headedness than dull girls; the reverse is the case with boys." See Experimental Study of Children, p. 1005. The significance of cranial defects is shown by the conditions correlated, as follows :— With Abnormal Nerve Signs. Delicate or Thin. Mentally Dull. No. of Cases. Percentage of Cases. No. of Cases.

The frequency of deviations from the normal cranial physiognomy, as far as regards boys and girls of school age, is shown in the following quotation from the report on 100,000 children I examined in conjunction with a com- mittee, 1888-92. Among 53,144 boys, 46,856 girls seen, there were reported as follows :— VOL. VII A small head, that is of circumference of 19 or less than 20 inches after seven years of age, is a defect—contrary to the rule—more fre- quent among girls than boys. There may be average mental ability, but the child usually remains thin and delicate, with liability to exhaustion. The palate, or space between the teeth of the upper jaw, may be defective in form and pro- portions, as seen in the vertical and horizontal plane.

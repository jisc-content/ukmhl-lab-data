The Bradshaw Lecture. 27 the cricoid cartilage of the larynx was on a level with that bone. When the tumour was viewed in profile, it extended eight inches from the front of the neck.‚Äù* Syme having satisfied him- self that the tumour was not malignant, and confident in his diagnosis, felt that it was susceptible of removal. Success crowned the work; the result fully justified his practice. The patient completely recovered, and twenty-six years afterwards presented himself, having come from America in perfect health. When it is borne in mind that Syme was then but twenty- seven years of age, outside the pale of hospital support, and that the removal of tumours of the jaw was a compaiative novelty, the striking character of this proof of his operative skill is truly remarkable. Sir Joseph Lister, who possesses this trophy of the ability of his illustrious father-in-law, enables me to afford you an inspection of the specimen and of the picture taken before operating. Sixty-seven years have elapsed since the operation was achieved. The fame of the operator endures, and, I venture to say, will endure so long as the story of a great surgical career continues to be held in admiration. Here I pause. You, my audience of to-day, must be the judges as to whether or not my narrative of the beneficent surroundings that inseparably connect themselves with these measures carried out by Syme for the cure of disease justifies the conclusion that in the contemplation of his professional life we see an authority in the practice of our art approached by few and surpassed by none. I appeal to that wider audience, the members of our calling in these islands, in our colonies, and wherever English surgery is known, to join in agreement with this conviction. * Edin.

THE BRADSHAW LECTURE FOR 1894. Mr. President and Gentlemen, It is not, I venture to think, an inappropriate fulfilment of the intention of the founder of this lecture that, apart from some special subject of surgical science or practice that might be selected, the consideration of the career of a great surgeon could be chosen as affording material of the highest interest and value. More especially is this the case when it happens that the life in contemplation—that of James Syme—bestowed bene- fits not only on the country of his birth, but on all countries where human suffering sought relief at the hands of surgery. Though upwards of twenty years have passed away since the death of Syme, I feel convinced that those amongst us who knew the man and his work, or those who can only learn what he was by his writings, will unite in a judgment that very few in the history of surgery have equalled him in his absolute devo- tion to his calling, and none have surpassed him in the utility of his practical suggestions for the preservation of the lives and limbs of his fellow-creatures. If the earlier period during which Syme taught clinical surgery was not so striking in its developments as the later, arising from what followed the discovery of anaesthetics, the application of the antiseptic system, and the use of ligatures antiseptically prepared, it must be borne in mind that the difficulties surrounding the successful practice of surgery at that time were augmented, and demanded the extreme of personal attention. Notwithstanding, Syme overcame them.

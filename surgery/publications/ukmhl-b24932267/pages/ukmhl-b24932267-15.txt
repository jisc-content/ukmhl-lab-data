To SIR JOSEPH LISTER, Bart., F.R.S., Surgeon Extraordinary to the Queen. My Dear Lister, I hope you will accept the dedication of this Lecture. You must be beyond all men best able to place a just value on any tribute offered to the memory of Syme— you, his Son-in-Law—you, his successor in Clinical teaching, and his follower in the development of the highest forms of surgical science. Believe me to remain. Yours ever truly, OLIVER PEMBERTON.
